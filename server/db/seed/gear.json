Multi-Tool  # Weapons  After Z-Day, practically everyone is armed, and while some people have been particularly lucky to retrieve reliable, real weapons, most make do with what they have. Guns, in particular, have become a blessing and a curse for many enclaves, though a reliable machete is worth five times its weight in military rations.  ## Attack Rolls  *Ranged Weapon Attacks:* Using a Firearm, archaic missile weapons, and thrown weapon require a ranged attack roll where you use your dexterity bonus plus your rank to hit and add your dexterity bonus to damage.  *Melee Weapon Attacks:* Using melee weapons requires a melee attack roll utilizing your strength or dexterity bonus plus your rank to hit, depending upon the weapon used.  ## Firearms & Archaic Missile Weapons  Firearms and archaic missile weapons deal damage and possess qualities that work much like powers; an assault rifle, for example, might possess Energy Blast (Ballistic): 20. Thus, this weapon would deal 1d10 (ballistic) damage and have a base range of 5 areas. Additionally, some weapons may give access to unique firing modes that work, such as maneuver.  Firearms have magazines or drums that allow for several shots before needing to be reloaded. But unlike most firearms, however, archaic missile weapons must be reloaded after every shot.",

    "name": "Melee Weapons",
    "description": "Melee weapons are essential tools for survival, offering reliability and a personal touch in combat where firearms might fail or be unavailable. From the brute force of a heavy sledgehammer to the precision of a finely crafted katana. Melee weapons require no ammunition and can be improvised from everyday objects.  Any time someone uses anything as a melee weapon, refer to the table below. If a specific weapon is not on the list, simply look for a comparable item and use the damage listed.  **Melee Weapon Damage and Damage Types:** Melee weapons deal their damage die plus your strength modifier or dexterity modifier, depending upon the weapon used. All common melee weapons deal with either kinetic, piercing, or slashing damage, which are covered under the melee damage type. Note that some weapons may be able to deal more than one damage type; a sword can slash as well as pierce effectively; such cases must be agreed upon by your editor-in-chief.  **High Strength characters and melee weapons:** There are times when a hero may want to use a melee weapon for additional effect, even if their base Strength damage die exceeds the damage dealt by the weapon. In these cases, using such a weapon effectively increases their Strength by +2, but the weapon breaks after use. For example, shattering a telephone pole upon a Super Z’s thick skull.  <table> <colgroup> <col style=\"width: 61%\" /> <col style=\"width: 38%\" /> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\"><h4 id=\"table-x-x-melee-weapon-ap-cost\">Table X-X Melee Weapon AP cost</h4></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Damage Die</strong></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cost AP</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1d4 to 1d8</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1d10 to 1d12</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <table> <colgroup> <col style=\"width: 19%\" /> <col style=\"width: 80%\" /> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><h4 id=\"table-x-x-melee-weapons\">Table X-X: Melee Weapons </h4></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Damage Die</strong></td> <td><strong>Examples</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">Str.

For example, if you possessed 16 strength, your unarmed attacks deal 1d8+3 kinetic damage. If you are wearing gauntlets or something more exotic like iron-laced hand wraps, your unarmed attacks deal +2 damage.  **Hands Used/Required:** Weapons with d10 or higher damage require two hands to use effectively unless the creature is large or of greater size or is incredibly strong, at which point consult with your editor-in-chief. Weapons with damage of d8 or less may be used with both hands. You increase the damage type by 1 size, so a d8 becomes a d10.  **Quick Weapons:** You may opt to use your dexterity to hit and damage if the weapon’s base damage die is d8 or lower and it deals slashing or piercing damage.  <table> <colgroup> <col style=\"width: 54%\" /> <col style=\"width: 45%\" /> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\"><h4 id=\"table-x-x-other-weapons\">Table X-X: Other Weapons</h4></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><em><strong>Weapons</strong></em></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>AP</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Grande Launcher</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Flare gun</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Flamethrower</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stun Gun/Taser</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Molotov Cocktail</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em><strong>Grenades</strong></em></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>- Fragmentation</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>- Flashbang</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>- Concussion</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>- Incendiary</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>- Tear-Gas</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>- Knock-Out Gas</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>- Poison Gas</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>- Smoke</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  # Other Modern Weapons  Unlike firearms and archaic weapons, some weapons duplicate powers, and with their own Range which overrides the Base Power range.  **Flare gun**  A small, handheld device used to launch flares for signaling and illumination. It is commonly found in survival kits. Flare guns possess Energy Blast (Fire) 14, (d8 fire damage, 7 areas, shedding bright light in a 10-area range and dim light in a 10-area range beyond that until the end of your next turn. Anyone hit by a flare gun must make a Routine (DC:15) Dexterity saving throw or gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Fire* (see conditions pg xx). When fired into the sky, the flare can be seen as far as 5 miles away.  **Flamethrower:**  This weapon projects a stream of flammable liquid, igniting anything in its path. Highly effective against clusters of enemies, flamethrowers possess Energy Blast (Fire) 24 (1d12 fire damage, range 6 areas) and can be fired 5 times before needing to be reloaded. Anyone hit by a flamethrower must make a Routine (DC:15) Dexterity saving throw or gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Fire)* (see conditions pg xx). While normal fuel can be used, it reduces the weapon’s effectiveness, lowering the Energy Blast (Fire) to 14 (d8 fire damage, range 3 areas).  **Stun Gun/Taser:**  These non-lethal weapons are designed to incapacitate targets with an electric shock. Commonly used for self-defense and law enforcement, stun guns deliver an Energy Blast (Electrical) 24 (1d12 electrical damage/range of 1 area) shock. Creatures hit with a stun gun/taser must make a Routine (DC 15) Constitution saving throw or fall *Prone* and *Stunned (Lesser, Electrical)* until the end of their next turn.  **Molotov Cocktail**  The easily created Molotov Cocktail has become quite common, becoming the most common use of loss of possible salvage once a fire goes totally out of control. All creatures within the affected area suffer an Energy Explosion (Fire): 20 blasts dealing 1d10 Fire damage. Targets within the area must make a successful Routine (DC: 15) Dexterity saving throw or gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Fire)* (see conditions pg xx).  ## Grenades  Grenades come in two forms: as a round for a Grenade launcher or as a hand grenade. Hand Grenades are thrown weapons, while Grenade rounds commonly fired from a Grenade launcher.  Grenades do not target a specific location but rather an area. When attacking with Grenades, the attacker needs only to succeed in an Easy (DC: 10) ranged attack roll. If the attack roll fails, the grenade lands in a Radom-adjacent area.  **Grande Launcher:**  Τηεσε shoulder-fired weapons launch grenades over a considerable distance. It is designed to provide explosive firepower with accuracy. These weapons may fire Concussion, Fragmentation, Incendiary, Tear-Gas, Knock-Out Gas, Poison Gas, or Smoke grenades at a 10-area range. **Grenade Launchers do not follow the general rule for ammunition. You must have a grenade round to launch it from a grenade launcher.**  **Fragmentation Grande:**  A standard military-grade explosive device designed to disperse shrapnel upon detonation, causing severe injuries over a wide area. All creatures within the affected area must make a dexterity saving throw (DC: 14) or suffer 1d6 Kinetic and 2d6 Piercing damage.  **Flashbang Grande:**  A non-lethal explosive device used to disorient and incapacitate enemies with a loud bang and blinding flash of light. All creatures within the affected area must make a successful Challenging (DC 20) Constitution saving throw or become *Blinded (Partial, Light)* + *Stunned (Lesser, Sonic)*. until the end of your next turn. This grenade does not affect zombies but will attract them.  **Concussion Grande:**  An explosive device that delivers a powerful shockwave, knocking down and disorienting those within its blast radius. All creatures within the affected area suffer 2d8 Kinetic damage, forcing creatures in the area affected to make a successful Routine (DC: 15) consultation saving throw or be *Prone* + *Stunned (Lesser, Kinetic)* until the end of your next turn.  **Corrosive Grande:**  A grenade originally designed to melt doors and locks for breach maneuvers, some super villains and rogue nations developed these grenades into fully fledged anti-personnel weapons. All creatures within the affected area suffer 1d12 Acid damage and gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Acid, -2 Armor DR)* (see conditions pg xx).  **Incendiary Grande:**  A grenade that ignites upon explosion, spreading fire over the targeted area and causing severe burns. All creatures within the affected area suffer 1d12 Fire damage and gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Fire)* (see conditions pg xx).  **Tear-Gas Grande:**  A non-lethal chemical weapon that disperses an irritating gas, causing temporary blindness and incapacitation. All creatures within the affected area must make a successful Challenging (DC 20) Constitution saving throw or become *Blinded (Partial, Irritant)* + *Weakened (Fortitude, Poison, Mild)* until the end of your next turn. This grenade has no effect on zombies.  **Knock-Out Gas Grande:**  A chemical weapon designed to release a gas that renders those within its radius unconscious. All creatures within the affected area must make a successful Routine (DC: 15) Constitution saving throw or fall *Unconscious (knocked out).* At the end of each turn, unconscious creatures make another saving throw, waking up upon a successful save or after 5 failed saves. This grenade has no effect on zombies.  **Poison Gas Grande:**  A lethal chemical weapon that disperses toxic gas, causing severe disorientation and physiological distress. All creatures within the affected area must make a successful Challenging (DC 20) Constitution saving throw or become *Weakened (Ability Scores, Poison)*. At the end of each turn, poisoned creatures make another saving throw. The condition ends upon a successful save or after 5 failed saves. This grenade has no effect on zombies.  **Smoke Grande:**  A small metal canister that releases a dense, acrid cloud of smoke upon activation. The area it affects becomes heavily obscured, making it nearly impossible to see through. Creatures within or attempting to see into or through the cloud have disadvantage on all vision-based checks and attack rolls. The smoke lingers until the end of the scene or until dispersed by strong wind or environmental effects. Perfect for covering retreats, confusing the enemy, or masking movement through dangerous ground.  # Armor  In the harsh and unforgiving world where threats come from both the living and the undead, armor is an essential component of any survivor’s gear. While armor can limit mobility and be cumbersome, the added defense often makes the trade-off worthwhile, offering peace of mind in the chaotic and perilous post-Z-Day environment. Whether it’s a reinforced leather jacket, a riot shield, or a full tactical suit, the right armor can mean the difference between life and death.  <table> <colgroup> <col style=\"width: 73%\" /> <col style=\"width: 26%\" /> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\"><h4 id=\"table-x-x-armor\">Table X-X Armor </h4></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><em><strong>Body Armor</strong></em></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cost AP</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tactical Body Armor</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Reinforced Clothing</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ballistic Vest</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em><strong>Archaic/Makeshift Armor</strong></em></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Boiled Leather Armor</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Chain Mail</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Heavy Clothing</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em><strong>Shields</strong></em></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Riot Shield</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Shield</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  ##  Using Armor  Worn, non-power-based armor possesses two attributes: DR (Damage Reduction) and Bulk.  *Damage Reduction* reduces the amount of damage suffered by its value. This reduction is applied before possible massive damage can be determined. For example, some armor provides protection against physical damage while offering protection against energy damage. *Damage Reduction* is further explained on page XX  *Bulk* is a penalty to the wearer’s Avoidance defense and all Dexterity based skill checks.  ##  Stacking Armor  You can wear different armor types. When you do, the highest Damage Resistance (DR) against a particular damage type prevails, but you suffer Bulk and Avoidance penalties for all armor worn.  #### Modern Body Armor  Tactical body armor has come a long way over the last few years with some higher end companies utilizing Newtonian liquids/gels to stop high impact rounds while still allowing for a wide range of moment. Sadly, for survivors, zombies are not well known for their use of firearms.  *Tactical Body Armor* (DR vs. Physical 3/Energy 2/Ballistic 6, Bulk: 1)  Commonly used by the military and specialized law enforcement, tactical body armor consists of ballistic vests and reinforced clothing, including knee and elbow pads.  *Reinforced Clothing* (DR vs. Physical 2/Energy 2, Bulk: 0)  A very expensive form of body armor, reinforced clothing is made of Newtonian fibers. While it does not afford a lot of protection, it grants balanced protection against many attack forms. Before Z-Day hit, Reinforced Clothing had become the “go-to” armor among Heroes and Villains alike.  *Ballistic Vest* (DR vs. Physical 1/ Ballistic 6, Bulk: 0)  This is your standard Kevlar vest, very good against ballistic attacks, but almost worthless against melee and energy attacks.  #### Archaic/Makeshift Armor  Over the last few years some people have attempted to recreate some older forms of body armor. While they afford protection against melee attacks, it is much harder to maneuver in them.  *Chain Mail* (DR vs. Physical 4/Energy 1, Bulk: 2)  A form of armor made from linked steel rings, some survivors have started to make this kind of armor from sniped coiled leather which they then link and solder together.  *Boiled Leather Armor* (DR vs. Physical 3/Energy 0, Bulk: 1)  Uncommon to say the least, but some survivors turned to using boiled cow leather. These sets are molded to each individual, and although a set can be worn by anyone, they are increasingly uncomfortable to wear if not molded to you, granting an additional point of Bulk to anyone for whom they were not specifically made.  *Heavy Clothing* (DR vs. Physical 2/Energy 0, Bulk: 0)  Any attire that is either made of heavier material (such as a leather trench coat) or designed for sports protection (hockey/skating pads) can be worn with Ballistic Vests, in which case the higher ARs prevail. Wearing both imparts 1 points of bulk.  #### Shields  Previously limited to riot control and as the chosen calling card of a few heroes, shields have come back into some use after Z-Day.  Shields gives you a +1 bonus for your avoidance additionally they allow some heroes to use the shielding maneuver (see maneuvers on page XX)  Riot Shields are made of transparent reinforced Plexiglas, and though they are very handy, they are not as rugged as classic shields. Riot shields possess Material Strength of 12, and can take Hits: 2  Classic shields are made of reinforced wood with a steel brace or are often simply made of steel; though they are heavy and a little ungainly, these shields are incredibly resilient. Classic Shields possess Material Strength of 20, and can take Hits: 6  Makeshift shields utilize the material’s Material Strength (MS) and Hits as if they were only 1-inch-thick (see braking objects pg. xx); actual shields are reinforced and made to deflect damage and, as such, possess more hits than their material would afford.  # Optics/Tactical Gear  The following is a list of common tactical gear. With the prevalence of tactical gear throughout the United States, there is a good chance Heroes may start out with such gear. In other countries where firearms are more controlled, these sought-after items may be a little harder to come by. While this list is nowhere near a complete list of possible tactical gear, the ones listed have tangible in-game effects. Of course, you can always add more to your game.  <table> <colgroup> <col style=\"width: 73%\" /> <col style=\"width: 26%\" /> </colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\"><h4 id=\"table-x-x-opticstactical-gear\">Table X-X Optics/Tactical Gear</h4></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><em><strong>Tactical Gun Accessories</strong></em></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cost AP</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tactical Rail system</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tactical Flashlight</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tactical Laser point sight</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Silencer</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em><strong>Optics</strong></em></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tactical Dot Sight</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Standard Hunting Scope</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tactical Sniper Scope</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Night Vision Sight</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Night Vision Goggles</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Simple Night Vision</em></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Tactical Night Vision</em></td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

Being mounted on the firearm frees up the character’s other hand.  *Tactical Flashlight* – Tactical Flashlights are small, powerful LED flashlights that can be mounted upon any firearm equipped with a tactical rail system. The batteries on these flashlights last for about 40 hours of continuous use. These lights provide directional bright light up to a range of two areas and shadowy light for an area beyond that.  *Tactical Laser Point Sight* – These sights may be mounted upon any weapon with a tactical rail system. When used, they give the shooter a +1 bonus to hit when attacking any target within 3 areas. These Laser Sights produce a huge drain on their batteries and only last for a few hours of continuous use. Luckily, most point sights possess “trigger pads,” which allow them to be turned on right before firing at a target. Under such conditions, a set of batteries will last about 2 months of active, daily use.  *Silencer* – This can be utilized on any firearm that fires light or medium ammo, but it will only last for a limited number of shots (about 100 rounds). Hearing a Silenced firearm requires a successful DC: 20 *Perception (Hearing)* skill check.",

    "name": "First Aid Kits",
    "description": "Medical Kits come in several sizes, from small standard-sized medical kits to backpack-sized advanced medical packs. While some kits simply have more supplies than others, we suggest that you shy away from the minutia of tracking every bandage and every dose of antibiotic. Though we give these kits a static bonus for specific skills, the current state of these packages and when they run low is within the preview of the editor-in-chief. Unless they check regularly, Heroes may very well be caught by surprise when one or two supplies suddenly run out.  The Editor-in-Chief should treat first aid kits much like character flaws; at any time, the Editor-in-Chief may declare that the first aid kit is short of one or more needed pieces of equipment or essential medication. The players may accept the result and play through it, gaining a Plot Point, or counter it by spending a Plot Point. Regardless, once the editor-in-chief declares that a first aid kit is starting to run low, the heroes had better start looking to refill their stockpiles.  *Building a Medical Kit –* Heroes can use out-of-frame activities to restock existing medical kits; see page XX for out-of-frame activities.  *Standard first aid kit* – These are the standard first aid kits found in most homes and the trunks of high-end cars and occasional jeep. While this kit does not grant a bonus to a Hero’s *Medicine* Skill Checks, it is considered to be the right tool for the right job and, as such, negates any relevant penalties.  *EMT Medical Field Kit* – A larger kit, commonly carried in a modified tool/tackle box, these kits come with a large variety of bandages, pain relievers, antibiotic packages, instant ice packs, and some basic surgical tools. Any Hero utilizing this kit gains a +2 bonus to all *Medicine* Skill Checks. If a Hero is being treated for a disease or attempting to recover Wounds while being treated with this kit, they gain a +1 bonus to their Constitution Ability Checks.  *Tactical Response Pack* – Standard military backpack. These kits are highly sought after, packed with everything found in the *EMT Medical Field Kit* (just more of it) as well as Ammonia inhalants, liquid bandages, trauma dressings, and emergency surgical tools. Any Hero utilizing this kit gains a +3 bonus to all *Medicine* Skill Checks. If a Hero is being treated for a disease or attempting to recover Wounds while being treated with this kit, they gain a +2 bonus to their Constitution Ability Checks.  *Full Medical Response Pack* – Also known as a portable hospital, these packs are extremely rare, limited to military, police, emergency response units, and the occasional survival nut. These packs come with everything found in both the *Tactical Response Pack* and *EMT Medical Field kits* (just more of it), as well as CPR Masks, blood pressure kits, cervical collars, blood clotting spray, burn spray, and so on. Mere rumors of small stockpiles of these packs have led more than one Hero to their deaths. Any Hero utilizing this kit gains a +5 bonus to all *Medicine* Skill Checks. If a Hero is being treated for disease or attempting to recover Wounds while being treated with this kit they gain a +3 bonus to their Constitution Ability Checks.",

    "description": "**Backpack**  Coming in various sizes and styles backpacks can commonly hold about 10 items of regular gear comfortably, while a tactical backpack with a molle system can store 14 items.  **Batteryless “Shake” Flashlight**  These provide light for 3 rounds, requiring an action to charge it. These flashlights provide 2 areas of directional bright light and 2 areas of shadowy light beyond that.  **Binoculars**  Binoculars grant the user the equivalent of Super Sense (Telescopic Vision): 26 (+8) and require both hands to use properly.  **Binoculars, Night Vision**  This works just like standard Binoculars, but they also grant the user Super Sense (Night Vision): 26 (+8) as well. Night vision requires 6 AA batteries lasting for 6 hours of continuous use.  **Climbing Kit**  These kits consist of hammer, pitons, and hooks, granting the user a +2 bonus to all Athletics: (Climbing) checks.  **Duct Tape**  Perhaps the most useful piece of equipment, new, sealed rolls of Duct tape are highly sought after. Duct Tape possesses an effective Strength: 14 (+2) when used to tape things up.  **Fire Extinguisher**  Fire Extinguishers require two consecutive Demanding actions to use, snuffing out fire in a single area. After emptied, an Extinguisher is worthless, except possibly as a club.  **Firearm Maintenance Kit**  This kit grants a Hero a +2 bonus on all *Engineering/Firearms* Skill Checks when attempting to repair a jammed firearm.  **Flashlight**  These LED flashlights provide about 60 hours of continues life on a set of new batteries. They provide 2 areas of directional bright light and 2 area of shadowy light beyond that.  **Gas Mask**  Gas Masks provide the wearer with Life Support: 20 (+5), but only against gas attacks. These masks have filters which need to be cleaned out after every use.  **Hand Held GPS  ** Many of the GPS satellites continue to work though many of them have already begun to drift off their orbit. A common GPS can assist someone within 10 areas of their intended location. Military grade GPS’s are still very accurate. They may be used to navigate to within 1 area of any location on the planet.  **Handsets/2-Way Radios/** **Walkie-Talkie**  Possessing a battery life of 5 hours and an effective range of 1 mile, these radios have become quite effective, though their reliance on batteries limits their usefulness.  **Lantern – Solar, Battery, Gas**  Solar and battery lanterns only require a Simple action to turn on, while Gas powered lanterns require two Demanding actions and a source of fire (such as matches). Lanterns provide bright light to the area they are in and 2 areas of shadowy light to adjacent areas.  **Lock Picks**  These picks grant you a +2 bonus on challenges to open mechanical locks if you possess an appropriate skill set.  **Maps**  A good map and a compass are all you need to navigate to any location on the map. Very detailed maps might give you advantage on appropriate challenge rolls when you possess an appropriate skill set.  **Multi-Tool**  A good multi-tool is worth its weight in gold and is commonly qualifies as having right tool for the job (see skills)  **Rope/Rope (Nylon) 30’/ Rope (Kevlar) 30’/ ½” thick**  Standard rope has an effective Strength of 16(+3), nylon rope has an effective strength of 20 (+4), and Kevlar has an effective Strength of 22 (+6).  **Solar/Crank radio**  These radios have a range of 10 miles but rarely pick up any signals.  **Tool Kits**  Partial tool kits commonly qualify as having right tool for the job (see skills) while a Complete tool kits would also grant you a +2 bonus on all rolls to meet a challenge were your tools would be useful.  **Water Resistant Items**  Any “Water Resistant Item” allows the item in question to work in wet conditions, even allowing it to be submerged in 60 feet of water.  # Vehicles  Abandoned vehicles now crowd every street and almost every major highway. Helicopters lie dormant in airports, and ships drift the seas filled with the walking dead.  Depending upon the enclave and location, heroes may require the use of vehicles, be it for scouting or clearing out areas for scavenging. Most of the time, such vehicles will simply become backdrops, providing the heroes with a way to get between here and there, but there will be times when those very same vehicles can become godsends or lead to the heroes’ doom.  All vehicles have the following qualities: refer to individual vehicle descriptions for any additional rules.  **Handling**  This is an adjustment to the Hero’s Drive/Pilot Skill Checks. Such roles are only required when the driver/pilot is attempting a difficult maneuver (See Vehicle and Mounts, pg. XX).  **Speed**  These numbers represent the vehicle's speed ranks to determine acceleration and top speed, respectively. During combat, this translates directly to a number of areas of movement. So, a vehicle with 3/10 would have an acceleration speed of 3 areas and a top speed of 10 areas. Acceleration rate is how quickly the vehicle gains speed; with each turn, the vehicle can increase its speed by the stated amount until it reaches maximum speed. The car described above would require 4 turns of acceleration to reach top speed.  A ground and sea vehicle’s deceleration value (stopping power) is one-half their maximum speed, though the driver can always attempt to bring the vehicle to a complete stop as a Demanding action with a successful Challenging (DC: 20) Challenge. Flying vehicles are a different matter; except for VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) aircraft, such as helicopters, flying vehicles cannot stop moving until they land. Even then, all such aircraft require a landing strip distance equal to one half their maximum speed. Aircraft all possess a maneuverability rating (C) Clumsy, (A) Agile, and (P) Perfect.  If a speed is shown as +X, that speed is added to the Heroes’ Pace, with the Heroes’ Pace being that vehicle’s acceleration value.  **MS/Hits**  Denotes the Material Strength and the Hits the vehicle can absorb before ceasing to function. Each hit taken also applies a -1 penalty to the driver’s rolls to meet any driving challenge.  **Pass**  Number of passengers that may safely ride in the vehicle.  **Size**  Some vehicles may take up more than one area (such as Tractor Trailers) but the majority of them are still only considered one area in size.  **AP values and the lack there of**  You might notice that vehicles lack a AP cost, this is on purpose, vehicles are meant to be something found and maintained by your enclave, the editor may allow players who have the ability to “find” gear when you need it to find a working vehicle if the situation warrants it. Of course, there is always the use of plot points to alter the scene to find such a useful vehicle.  <table> <colgroup> <col style=\"width: 23%\" /> <col style=\"width: 15%\" /> <col style=\"width:

    "description": "Running out of fuel or sudden breakdowns should be treated as part of the narrative. You might *think* you have a full tank of gas but sometimes gas gauges give false readings, or maybe there was some water in that fuel, or maybe the fuel pump broke, leaking that fuel all over the road.  The editor can use this to start the heroes down a new story arc, to add tension, or simply to spice an encounter up. As such, rules for exact ranges and fuel consumption are completely unnecessary.",

    "description": "Gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, once the lifeblood of vehicles and machines, have become precious commodities. It's been 2-4 years since Z-day struck, and as a result, gasoline reserves have been depleted, leaving the survivors with limited options for conventional fuel sources.  It’s up to you, the Editor-in-Chief, to decide how fuel scarcity impacts the campaign. If you choose, you can hand-wave fuel availability, allowing the heroes to find miraculously untouched gas stations with full tanks of fuel. This approach keeps the focus on other aspects of the game while sparing players the logistical headaches of tracking fuel reserves.  Note that this setting also offers a solution, super tech that powers vehicles through alternative means or retrofitting vehicles to run on unconventional hydrocarbons. This opens up some interesting sub-plots or even entire storylines, as heros may need to hunt down or protect specialized technology.  \\</side bar\\>",
