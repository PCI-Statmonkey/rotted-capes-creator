It uses a PostgreSQL database managed through [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/).\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nCreate a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:\n\n```bash\n# Firebase configuration used on the client\nVITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-key\nVITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project\nVITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id\nVITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id\nVITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id\n\n# Optional Google Analytics key\nVITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-ga-id\n\n# PostgreSQL connection string used by the server and Drizzle\nDATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/db?sslmode=require\n```\n\nThese variables are loaded by both the server and the Vite client build.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nFollow these steps when first cloning the project or when pulling new changes\nfrom GitHub:\n\n1. **Grab the latest code**\n   ```bash\n   git pull origin main\n   ```\n   or if you haven't cloned the repository yet:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rotted-capes-creator.git\n   cd rotted-capes-creator\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Node dependencies**\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. **Create your `.env` file**\n   Copy the keys shown in the *Environment Variables* section above into a file\n   named `.env` in the project root.\n\n4. **Apply database migrations**\n   ```bash\n   npm run db:push\n   ```\n\n5. **(Optional) Seed the game data** – run once on a new database\n   ```bash\n   npm run seed:game\n   ```\n\n6. **Type-check the code**\n   ```bash\n   npm run check\n   ```\n\n7. **Start the development server**\n   ```bash\n   npm run dev\n   ```\n\nWhenever you pull new updates that modify `package.json` or `package-lock.json`,\nrun `npm install` again. If migrations were added, repeat step 4 to keep your\ndatabase in sync.\n\n## Development\n\nAfter completing the steps in **Quick Start**, use the command below whenever you\nwant to run the app locally:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThe server runs on `http://localhost:5000` with hot reloading provided by Vite.\n\n## Type Checking\n\nRun the TypeScript compiler to verify the build:\n\n```bash\nnpm run check\n```\n\nBe sure to run `npm install` before executing the check script so that all required dependencies are installed.\n\n## Database Migrations\n\nDatabase schema changes are managed with Drizzle. To apply pending migrations run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run db:push\n```\n\nThis executes `drizzle-kit push` using the `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` and updates the files inside the `migrations/` directory.\n\n## Repository Layout\n\n```\nclient/     - React front‑end code\nserver/     - Express API and Vite integration\nshared/     - shared TypeScript modules and database schema\nmigrations/ - Drizzle SQL migrations and relations\nscripts/    - seeding and helper scripts\nattached_assets/ - misc static assets\n docs/      - game documentation\n```\n\nThe `client/` folder is the Vite root, while the compiled assets are served from the Express server in development and production.\n\n### Character Sheet PDF\n\nThe inline character sheet now mirrors the layout of `attached_assets/Character Sheet_All New Design_2.0.pdf`. A two-column grid is rendered with Tailwind classes and exported PDFs use the same layout via `pdfGenerator`.\n","size_bytes":3327},"drizzle.config.ts":{"content":"import { defineConfig } from \"drizzle-kit\";\n\nif (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {\n  throw new Error(\"DATABASE_URL, ensure the database is provisioned\");\n}\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  out: \"./migrations\",\n  schema: \"./shared/schema.ts\",\n  dialect: \"postgresql\",\n  dbCredentials: {\n    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,\n  },\n});\n","size_bytes":325},"postcss.config.js":{"content":"export default {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n    autoprefixer: {},\n  },\n}\n","size_bytes":80},"tailwind.config.ts":{"content":"import type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\";\n\nexport default {\n  darkMode: [\"class\"],\n  content: [\n  \"./client/index.html\",\n  \"./client/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\",\n  \"./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\"\n],\n  safelist: [\n    \"text-sm\",\n    \"text-xs\",\n    \"text-white\",\n    \"text-gray-400\",\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n      sans: ['\"Comic Neue\"', 'sans-serif'],\n      display: ['\"Bangers\"', 'cursive'], // or another display font you're using\n    },\n      borderRadius: {\n        lg: \"var(--radius)\",\n        md: \"calc(var(--radius) - 2px)\",\n        sm: \"calc(var(--radius) - 4px)\",\n      },\n      colors: {\n        background: \"hsl(var(--background))\",\n        foreground: \"hsl(var(--foreground))\",\n        card: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--card))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--card-foreground))\",\n        },\n        popover: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--popover))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--popover-foreground))\",\n        },\n        primary: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--primary))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--primary-foreground))\",\n        },\n        secondary: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--secondary))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--secondary-foreground))\",\n        },\n        muted: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--muted))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--muted-foreground))\",\n        },\n        accent: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--accent))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--accent-foreground))\",\n        },\n        destructive: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--destructive))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--destructive-foreground))\",\n        },\n        border: \"hsl(var(--border))\",\n        input: \"hsl(var(--input))\",\n        ring: \"hsl(var(--ring))\",\n        chart: {\n          \"1\": \"hsl(var(--chart-1))\",\n          \"2\": \"hsl(var(--chart-2))\",\n          \"3\": \"hsl(var(--chart-3))\",\n          \"4\": \"hsl(var(--chart-4))\",\n          \"5\": \"hsl(var(--chart-5))\",\n        },\n        sidebar: {\n          DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--sidebar-background))\",\n          foreground: \"hsl(var(--sidebar-foreground))\",\n          primary: \"hsl(var(--sidebar-primary))\",\n          \"primary-foreground\": \"hsl(var(--sidebar-primary-foreground))\",\n          accent: \"hsl(var(--sidebar-accent))\",\n          \"accent-foreground\": \"hsl(var(--sidebar-accent-foreground))\",\n          border: \"hsl(var(--sidebar-border))\",\n          ring: \"hsl(var(--sidebar-ring))\",\n        },\n      },\n      keyframes: {\n        \"accordion-down\": {\n          from: {\n            height: \"0\",\n          },\n          to: {\n            height: \"var(--radix-accordion-content-height)\",\n          },\n        },\n        \"accordion-up\": {\n          from: {\n            height: \"var(--radix-accordion-content-height)\",\n          },\n          to: {\n            height: \"0\",\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      animation: {\n        \"accordion-down\": \"accordion-down 0.2s ease-out\",\n        \"accordion-up\": \"accordion-up 0.2s ease-out\",\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [require(\"tailwindcss-animate\"), require(\"@tailwindcss/typography\")],\n} satisfies Config;\n","size_bytes":3061},"vite.config.ts":{"content":"import { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport react from \"@vitejs/plugin-react\";\nimport path from \"path\";\nimport runtimeErrorOverlay from \"@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    react(),\n    runtimeErrorOverlay(),\n    ...(process.env.NODE_ENV !== \"production\" &&\n    process.env.REPL_ID !== undefined\n      ?

Oh, and you can still die, but only if you're lucky. This is the world after Z-Day, where the dead started walking and eating everyone in sight.\n\nYou see, our world was once pretty normal. Those were the Glory Days. We had cities with gleaming skyscrapers, suburban sprawls, the internet, mobile phones, fast food, television channels for every niche, the works. We also had superheroes. You know the type, they patrolled the city streets to keep them free from crime and, more importantly, kept the world safe from supervillains. For the most part, the caped types tended to balance each other out; yin and yang, that sort of thing.\n\nAt the time, I was just a sidekick. My handle was Torch, and I used to pal around with Lady Liberty, if by \"pal around\" you mean get captured a lot and basically bask in her glory. I could handle myself against the more mundane criminals and, after a while, most of us low-powered types, whether sidekick, evil minion, or street-level superhero, coined ourselves the B-Listers. The A-Listers got headlines, special reports, and the occasional mini-series. We B-Listers were lucky to get more than a passing mention.\n\nAnd then Z-Day hit. No one knows if it was a bomb, virus, alien influence, or what. All we know for sure is that one day, everyone in the city started turning into zombies. I don't know if it was local or global at first; Lady Liberty ordered me to protect some bystanders as she joined the other A-Listers, superhero and super-villain alike, to stop it. Unfortunately, most of the A-Listers were destroyed or, worse, turned into what we call \"Super Zombies.\"\n\nSince then, it's been a struggle to survive and we B-Listers are left to carry the heavy load; I can't remember the last time I saw an A-Lister that didn't want to eat my face. Most bystanders now live in enclaves, small fortified communities where they hope to keep out the zombies while praying that a Super Zombie doesn't find them.\n\nNow before you sign up for duty, let me warn you about one more thing. There's a reason why we still wear the masks and costumes. It's more than just a fashion statement. If Lady Liberty were still here she'd tell you that our costumes are symbols for the bystanders to rally behind; our words and deeds carry more weight in them than out of them. Also, our costumes act as a beacon for Super Zombies. As much as we hate to face them, we're better equipped to deal with them than the average bystander.\n\nOf course, for those of us who've left idealism behind, there's a more practical purpose to keeping on the costume. Whenever a zombie bites or scratches us, there's a chance that we may be infected. There are only two known cures. One is amputation, which, as you might expect, is a pretty big disadvantage in this world. The second is burning; if we burn the infected area then there's a chance we can escape becoming one of the flesh-eaters. The costume hides the burns.\n\nSo that's the basic rundown; what do you say? Do you want to stand with us and hold back the darkness for one more day, or are you just out for yourself? In either case, this book contains everything you need to step into the world of life after Z-Day.\n\n**\\<Side Bar\\>**\n\nZombie Code Authority   \nThroughout this book you'll see quotations from the ZCA, or Zombie Code Authority. This is practical advice for surviving in the zombie aftermath shared amongst B-Listers. They coined the \"ZCA\" as an homage to the Comics Code Authority, a self-censoring body that promoted certain standards in comic books. Feel free to ignore the ZCA advice at your peril.\n\n**\\</Side Bar\\>**\n\n# What is Rotted Capes?\n\nAt its core, **Rotted Capes** is a roleplaying game of post-apocalyptic survival in a world overrun by zombies with a particular twist; this event has taken place in a typical superhero comic book world and the players take on the roles of superheroes struggling to protect what's left of humanity.\n\nThe players aren't portraying just any superheroes. Most of the greatest heroes, the \"A-Listers,\" were consumed during the initial zombie outbreak (called \"Z-Day\"), leaving their sidekicks, minions, and \"street level\" costumed heroes to carry the heavy lifting protecting the survivors. Today, these \"B-Listers\" are the only heroes that humanity has left.\n\nAs a B-Lister, you are normally expected to protect an enclave, a small group of humanity, from falling prey to the wandering zombie hordes. Other B-Listers serve with you as the enclave's local super team, as well as the Deathwatch, normal people who've taken up arms to protect the enclave. In addition to keeping the \"Bystanders\" safe you also participate in \"loot teams\" to find supplies that the enclave so desperately needs.\n\nThe threats in this zombie apocalypse are many. In addition to the zombies, which always carry the risk of infection with them, there are super zombies, former superheroes that are now little more than psychopaths with a taste for human, and particularly superhero, flesh. Most of these creatures were formerly A-Listers, making them a potent, perhaps even an impossible, challenge for B-Lister teams. Catching sight of a super zombie usually means that it's time to run, not step up and fight.\n\nThere are also threats that are all too human. Enclaves struggle with each other over diminishing resources. Powerful leaders impose their will on a frightened populace. B-Listers find themselves at odds with romantic rivals or unsettled accounts from the Glory Days. There's a lot of conflict and drama to be had without ever leaving the enclave or sighting a zombie.\n\nMost of all, **Rotted Capes** is what YOU make of it. If you want to play up the campiness of second-rate heroes in way over their head, then go for it! If you really want a game of gritty survival, where relatives are willing to leave a loved one behind so that the zombies take him instead of her, then you can certainly play it that way too.\n\n**\\<side bar\\>**\n\nWhy not Three Genres?   \nWhile **Rotted Capes** was conceived as a fusion of the four color superhero and zombie horror genre, an argument can be made that it's really a fusion of three: four color superhero, zombie horror, and post-apocalypse. While this is certainly true without splitting hairs (otherwise we'd end up with several genres), we think that, in terms of inspiration for **Rotted Capes**, zombie horror sufficiently covers the post-apocalyptic genre. At least two long-running film series originally started as relatively isolated incidents that blew up into full-blown apocalypses as the series went on. **Night of the Living Dead** (1968) begins an apocalypse that carries through two different sets of sequels. **Resident Evil** (2002) involves an infected corporation and by the second film the entire city is consumed followed by the world. As we expect most casual watchers of zombie movies are most familiar with these two series, it stands to reason that they'd tend to think of them in apocalyptic terms.\n\n**\\</side bar\\>**\n\n# A Mashing of Genres\n\n**Rotted Capes** is a blending of two popular genres, the four-color superhero genre and the zombie survival genre. We've attempted to strike a balance between the two to create a setting that evokes the best parts of both and merges them into a fun, playable whole.\n\nSo how best can we strike the balance? In four-color superhero games, most heroes can rely on their powers; many of them, in fact, have an array of powers available to them. Your average Hero may be armored, have the ability to project energy, is able to fly, and can see through walls. She doesn't need skills or equipment because her powers can usually overcome any obstacle.\n\nOn the flip side, there are heroes that rely more on wits than power. Such heroes may only have one power that, while useful, leaves them humanly vulnerable in most other ways, leading them to train hard physically and design bulletproof costumes or equipment to aid them.\n\n**Rotted Capes** takes the latter approach by making all player-controlled heroes \"B-Listers,\" heroes that don't have a vast array of powers. A B-Lister may have only one great power, a couple of lesser ones, or even none at all. She may be \"always a sidekick, never a hero\" or simply a budding hero at the dawning of her powers. Such heroes need to use their wits and skills to survive a zombie aftermath as much as, if not more so than, their powers.\n\nSimilarly, equipment is often important in zombie survival scenarios. If ten zombies are attacking you and you only have six bullets, you're going to make sure that each bullet counts. Similarly, a hero in **Rotted Capes** can't rely on her powers all of the time. Using powers is physically exhausting, and a hero risks collapse if she just throws energy bolt after energy bolt at every opportunity.\n\nAnother nod to the superhero genre is the idea that heroes can shrug off injuries and get a second wind. So long as a hero survives a scene, she can catch her breath and be back to full capacity in the next. The only exception to this is serious injury, known as Wounds, which must be healed normally.\n\nHowever, this is also a game about zombie survival. Zombies are horrific creatures; they don't feel pain, they don't need to rest, and they can transmit their condition. Z-Day is about survival, and some people are more Darwinian than others. Just because you're a B-Lister doesn't necessarily make you a hero. You may only do 'heroic' acts because it's convenient. You need fellow heroes and bystanders to help you survive. Even if you were a 'boy scout' superhero in the Glory Days, you may have succumbed to the harsh realities of the world as it is. Many bystanders are thrilled when a popular superhero joins their enclave, only to have that Hero impose her will with an iron fist.\n\nIn another nod to zombie survival convention, the heroes aren't protecting an archetypal \"series city\" against threats. Instead, they protect a hidden enclave of survivors. This enclave could be a bomb shelter, a remote country home, a boarded-up and reinforced warehouse, or even an old super-villain' lair. The city has long been overrun and is useful only for scavenging.\n\nSpeaking of which, scavenging plays a very important role in **Rotted Capes**. Part of protecting your enclave involves seeing to their needs. The Hero may be expected to accompany bystanders on food raids or salvaging old equipment. They may need to lure powerful Super Zombies away before they can destroy a caravan or wandering bystander.\n\nFinally, heroes are survivors and have to make hard decisions. No matter how much a hero admired Super Commander in life, there are no prisons for Super Commander the Zombie. The Hero has by necessity become a killer, protecting her enclave by destroying zombies that threatens it, bystander and Hero alike.\n\n**\\<Side Bar\\>**\n\n## Striking the Balance\n\nWhile we've done our best to provide a fun game, we're certain that some Editor-in-Chiefs may want to run the game with a different style. They may want the players to be more like A-Listers, dropping Burnout costs for powers and increasing the power ranks available, or they may want to more closely adhere to zombie survival, slowing Stamina recovery and putting a greater emphasis on enclave politics and survival rather than super-fights between B-Listers and Super Zombies. As always, it's your call. Feel free to modify these rules as needed to create the post-apocalyptic setting that's right for you and your group.\n\n**\\</Side Bar\\>**\n\n## The Spirit of the Rules: Narration over Simulation\n\nThere are two distinct styles of tabletop roleplaying: Narration play and Simulation play. Each style offers a unique approach to shaping the play experience. But here, amid all the crunch and mechanics, we embrace the power of the narrative.\n\nThink of the crunchy simulation mechanics as the game's brain, and powerful narration mechanics as the game's heart. It's the game's narration that drives the game forward. From enclave events, personality flaws, and plot points, several mechanics poignantly bring the narration to the forefront. It's not just about crunching numbers and winning battles, but about crafting a tale of heroism, sacrifice, and creating memorable moments.\n\nCombat may feel familiar, but when we embrace the narration, it takes on a different flavor. And suddenly, the doors are blown wide open. You're not limited to how the scene was originally described; you, as a player, can help shape it. In the heat of battle, you will come up with ideas out of a box office thriller or from the pages of a comic. We let you bring those moments to your game, letting plot points fly!\n\nThe world of Rotted Capes heroes battle against imposable odds to protect small groups of survivors from the ever-present threat of being zombie chow. They face off against hordes of typical dead heads, twisted abominations, and super z's. But this game is more than a clash of titans, it's a world where the real focus is on the personal struggles, the growth of heroes, and the weight of their choices.\n\nIt's within plot points and personal flaw mechanics that powerful tools of narration emerge. Plot points allow the players to shape scenes and nudge the hand of fate, allowing for heroic feats and entertaining moments. Meanwhile, personal flaws lend depth to characters, enabling them to grapple with inner demons even as they confront the ruthless nature of the world they inhabit.\n\nThe goal is not simply to emerge victorious, but to breathe life into your tale. As in the comics, where heroes sometimes falter and fall before rising once more, here, the focus is on the drama and the emotional rollercoaster that takes players on a memorable ride.\n\nSo, whether you don the mantle of the Editor-In-Chief who shapes the narrative's course or step into the shoes of a heroic character with all their flaws and aspirations, remember that the essence of Rotted Capes lies in storytelling.\n\nLet the narration & simulation work together, and together, these mechanics will forge unforgettable games which will live in your memory for years to come.\n\n**\\<Side Bar\\>**\n\n## A Glossary of Terms\n\n**A-Lister:** One of the major superheroes in the Glory Days; she probably had her own comic book and movie.\n\n**B-Lister:** A low-powered superhero or villain, usually a minion or sidekick during the Glory Days.\n\n**Big Box Village:** A cluster of large retail stores, often landscaped into a mini-village of sorts.\n\n**Burn Victim:** Someone that was infected but cured through burning.\n\n**Bystander:** Any character that is not a Hero, Villain, or Zombie.\n\n**Clear Zone:** An area that's declared zombie-free.

Here are the things you'll need:\n-   At least one other player, optimally four.\n-   One or two sets of polyhedral dice (a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). See what dice I need below for more.\n-   Character sheets, either homemade, copied from the back of this book, or downloaded from Paradigm Concepts' website.\n-   Pen and paper, either physical or electronic.\n-   A healthy dose of imagination.\n\nWhile not required, here are some other things you may want on hand.\n\n-   Counters or miniatures to represent heroes, zombies, and bystanders.\n-   Appropriate background music drawn from both superhero and zombie movies\n-   Appropriate pictures of Heroes and Super Zombies.\n\n# The Basics\n\nBefore we get started, let's make sure you understand the basics of surviving life after Z-Day. While you can get away with lively discussions when it's just us heroes, the zombies aren't much for talking. Eventually, you'll need to rely on your abilities, which will require some dice rolls.\n\n## What dice do I need?\n\nThe rules will let you know when you are required to roll these dice and how many die you need to roll, as well as any modifiers to the die final result. If you are required to roll more than one die, the number will be noted before the d, so 2d10 would mean you need to roll two 10-sided dice. Any modifier to be applied to the roll will be noted after the dice size, as such a roll of 2d10+5 would mean rolling 2d10 and adding 5 to the result.\n\n# Hero Traits\n\nThese traits generally define what your Hero is capable of, how quick and strong they are, how well trained, and how well they can shake off things like mental possession.\n\n## Ability Scores\n\nThese define your physical and mental capabilities, including your strength, intelligence, and quickness. Ability Scores are broken down into six attributes. All creatures possess these ability scores; each score has a number that defines that ability's magnitude. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but heroes and villains are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches, with some reaching Olympic levels of capability with scores as high as 20. Some heroes, such as superhumans, demigods, and androids, can reach theoretically unlimited potential beyond these limits. See page XX for more on Ability Scores.\n\n-   Strength – How strong you are, how much you can lift, how hard you punch\n-   Dexterity – How quick and agile you are, how fast you can run, and how quickly you react.\n-   Constitution – How hearty you are, how well you can shake off infection and toxins.\n-   Intelligence – How smart you are; how much you remember.\n-   Wisdom – How insightful and perceptive you are. Where intelligence is knowing things, wisdom is understanding implications and careful application of that knowledge.\n-   Charisma – the strength of your personality, how charming you are, and how you manipulate and inspire others.\n\n**Ability Modifiers:** Ability score modifiers range from -1 (for an ability score of 1) to +20 (for a score of 50) and are derived from your Ability Score. To determine your ability modifier, subtract 10 from the ability score and divide the total by 2 (round down). You can also refer to the Ability & Power Score Table on pg XX. Ability Modifiers affect almost every d20 roll and come up in play more often than their associated scores.\n\n## Origin and Archetype\n\nYour Origin represents the source of your powers, while your Archetype represents what you do with those powers. Maybe your Origin is that you're an Alien from another dimension, a demigod, or a superhuman. While your Archetype may be a brawler who likes to get into the thick of it? Or maybe you're a controller using your abilities to control the weather, or maybe the minds of others?\n\n## Defenses\n\nYour defenses represent how difficult you are to target or affect whenever a hostile action targets you. All Attack Rolls are rolled against one of these three defenses. See page XX for more on Defenses and their use in combat see page XX.\n\n-   **Avoidance -** How hard you are to hit physically, in essence, how quick you are, and how well you can read where the attack is coming from and know how best to avoid it.\n-   **Resilience –** Your ability to withstand poisons, toxins, and direct attacks upon your physiology.\n-   **Willpower –** Your ability to withstand mental control, attacks upon your psyche, effects that manipulate your behavior, and sap your resolve.\n\n## Wounds & Stamina\n\nWounds and Stamina are a measure of your overall physical resilience and how much punishment you can take before being knocked out or killed.\n\n-   **Stamina** is a measure of your physical endurance.\n-   **Wounds** are a measure of how much punishment you can take before the risk of death.\n\nWhen you take damage in combat or from accidents such as falling, you lose Stamina. But when you suffer a grievous injury, you gain a Wound. While Stamina is quickly regained, wounds take time to heal. For more information on Wounds and Stamina, see page XX; for how they are used in combat, see page XX.\n\n## Grit\n\nGrit is your ability to remain mentally focused, keeping your wits about you through even the most trying conditions. It also represents your ability to shake off things that would break the minds of an ordinary person, push through mental adversity, and cope with demanding situations. Your Grit bonus is added to all Saving Throws, most used when resisting the effects of psychosis and horror. However, Grit can also be used when you attempt to push yourself beyond your limits. Your Grit bonus is equal to your Hero's rank, which may be further increased with feats and powers.\n\n## Pace\n\nPace is the number of areas you can move during your action. Areas are an abstract measure of distance. An Area may be a room in a house, a hallway, or any other enclosed space. Larger rooms and outdoor areas are divided into roughly 20x20-foot Areas. For more on Pace, see page XX, and for its use in combat, see page XX. Note: if you are playing with maps that use 5' squares, you can alternatively multiply a character's Pace by 4 for the number of squares they can move.\n\n## Skills Sets\n\nSkill Sets represent your Hero's background, training, and unique survivor experience, the sum of what they know and what they've practiced under fire. Do they know how to keep a generator running after years of neglect? Calm panicked civilians? Navigate collapsed urban landscapes?\n\nInstead of tracking narrow individual skills, Rotted Capes uses broad, cinematic Skill Sets that encompass a thematic area of expertise. Each Skill Set can be creatively applied to various situations, provided the player justifies it and the Editor-in-Chief agrees. Skill Sets add your Rank Bonus to ability checks when they apply.\n\nSkill Sets may also include Edges, specialties within that skill set that grant even greater bonuses when you can apply an Edge to a challenge. When a Skill Set rarely comes into play but shines in just the right moment, especially when tied to your Hero's backstory, it triggers a Deep Cut Moment, granting Advantage and earning you a Plot Point.\n\nFor more on Skill Sets, Edges, and how to use them to tell your Hero's story, see page XX.\n\n## Powers\n\nPowers, oh yes, powers. Powers are what set most heroes apart from everyday bystanders. Powers possess a power score like your ability score, ranging from 9 to 40+. This power score is used to determine your power modifier and dice used for damage rolls. **Power Modifications** are a collection of flaws and perks that allow you to customize your powers. These power modifications give a bonus or penalty to your final power score.\n\nAdditionally, once you have your powers, you can improve your proficiency with them in several ways. For example, you can increase your power score, learn an **emulated power** that allows you to duplicate another power, albeit at a lower power score, or learn power tricks, which are new ways to utilize the powers you develop during play.\n\n**Power Modifiers:** Power Score modifiers range from -0 to +20 and are derived from your Power Score. To determine your power score modifier, subtract 10 from the power score and divide the total by 2 (round down). You can also refer to the Ability & Power Score Table on pg. XX.\n\n## Burnout\n\nIn the dystopian setting of Rotted Capes, superheroes face a phenomenon known as Burnout. This sometimes occurs when one pushes their powers too far, causing their powers to shut down and stop working. Before Z-day, Burnout was not much of an issue, but it has become much more prevalent since the apocalypse. The lack of advanced facilities to maintain equipment, inadequate nutrition, and the constant stress of surviving among zombies might contribute to this issue. Each power comes with a \"**Burnout Cost**,\" and during any given scene, users must monitor their total Burnout. If they exceed their **Burnout Threshold**, they become progressively exhausted and face an increasing likelihood of their powers failing throughout the scene. For detailed information about **Powers** and **Burnout,** refer to page XX.\n\n## Feats\n\nFeats are a collection of features that may represent training in a new skill, a special talent, or an advanced level of training beyond mere skill aptitude. There are also **Power Feats** that specifically change the way you interact with your powers, or grant you an improved level of mastery, or improve a power score.\n\n## Features\n\nMuch like feats, features represent an evolution of your Hero, gained from leveling up. Each Origin possesses a set of features you can choose from.\n\n## Gear\n\nOne of the most essential things is your starting gear. Besides providing means of survival, that trusty .45 Colt you picked up will keep the zombies at bay when you Burnout. For more information on gear, check out page XX\n\n# The Core Mechanics\n\nFrom blasting at a zombie with their powers to scavenging through the remains of a ransacked building or negotiating with a roving biker gang, events like these will call upon your Hero's skill and physical capabilities, so in such actions where the outcome is uncertain, *we roll a d20.*\n\nThe core mechanic of the game is based on a d20 roll plus modifiers versus a target number. If the total of the die roll plus modifiers equals or surpasses the target number, the roll is considered a success. This simple rule governs most task resolutions.\n\n**Modifiers:** can be either bonuses or penalties derived from several sources, like ability scores, skills, powers, rank, feats, gear, as well as circumstances such as attempting to fire an arrow as you fall off the side of a building.\n\nTarget Numbers are commonly set by the editor-in-chief, which lets the players know if they succeeded or not. These Target Numbers can come from a variety of sources. They will be referred to as a Difficulty Class (DC), which may be a simple, arbitrary number, or set by a Passive Power DC, Defense, or the result of an Opposed roll.   \n  \n**Advantage and Disadvantage**\n\nYou can gain Advantage or Disadvantage on any roll, whether it's an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check.\n\n-   **Advantage**: Roll an additional d20 and use the higher result.\n-   **Disadvantage**: Roll an additional d20 and use the lower result.\n\nFor example, if you have Disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. Conversely, if you have Advantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 17.\n\nWhen multiple factors affect a roll with both Advantage and Disadvantage, you still roll only one additional d20. If conditions grant both Advantage and Disadvantage, they cancel each other out, and you roll a single d20 as normal. For example, if you have two conditions granting Advantage and one imposing Disadvantage, you still have Advantage on your roll.\n\n### Critical Success and Critical Failure\n\nAny time you are making an attack roll, saving throw, or a skill check, a roll of 1 or 20 before applying any modifiers is a critical failure (on a 1) or a Critical Success (on a 20); For the most part, a natural (before modifiers are applied) 20 is always a success, while a 1 is always a failure. See Skill Checks: Critical Results (pg. XX) and Combat: Critical Hits/Misses (pg. XX) for more.\n\n# Types of Checks\n\nDuring gameplay, you will be required to make five specific types of checks: Challenges (Ability Checks), Saving Throws, Power Checks, and Attack Rolls. All of these use the core mechanic previously presented above.   \n  \n**Challenges (Ability Scores Checks):** Challenges represent those moments when your Hero is tested by the world around them, climbing a crumbling wall, hacking a scavenged terminal, or holding back a collapsing doorway just long enough for civilians to escape. To resolve a Challenge, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier (and sometimes your Rank Bonus if a Skill Set applies). Compare the total to the Difficulty Class (DC) set by the Editor-in-Chief. Success means your Hero overcomes the obstacle; failure means the story takes a dramatic turn, often adding tension, danger, or complications rather than bringing play to a halt.\n\n**Saving Throws** are a special type of ability check where you add your rank to the roll. They are used to resist effects that could overwhelm an average person or to help you break free from adverse conditions. For example, when making an **Intelligence Saving Throw**, roll a d20 and add your Intelligence modifier, your Grit bonus, and any other relevant modifiers. Compare the total to the Difficulty Class (DC). For more details on **Grit,** see page XX.\n\n**Power Checks** are tests of your power's potential and/or your proficiency in its use. Each power possesses a corresponding ability score referred to as the power's linked ability. When a Power Check is called for, roll a d20 and add your power modifier, your rank, and any other relevant modifiers. For more on **Power Checks,** see pg XX.\n\n**Attack Rolls** are used to make attacks against creatures or objects. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add either your ability modifier or power modifier, plus your rank and any other relevant modifiers. The result is compared against one of three defenses: Avoidance, Resilience, or Willpower. For more on Attack Rolls, see pg. XX  \n  \nChallenges (Ability Checks)\n\nThroughout the game, your Hero will face **Challenges**, pivotal moments that test their abilities, training, and creativity. Challenges use the core mechanic: roll a d20 and add modifiers, attempting to meet or exceed the set target number referred to as its Difficulty Class (DC).\n\nWhen a Challenge arises, the Editor-in-Chief describes the situation and sets the DC based on difficulty. You, as the player, describe how your Hero approaches the Challenge, and which ability and/or Skill Set they draw upon. The Editor-in-Chief determines whether the justification is reasonable.\n\n**Ability-Only Challenge:** When no applicable Skill Set can reasonably be applied, the Challenge is resolved as a pure Ability Check. Roll a d20 and add the relevant ability score modifier. Compare the result to the DC.\n\n**Applying a Skillset:** When one of your Skill Sets applies, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier **plus your Rank Bonus**. If an Edge within that Skill Set also applies, double your Rank Bonus for this check. Creative use of Skill Sets is encouraged. Pitch your idea to the Editor-in-Chief!\n\nThis system is designed to empower cinematic storytelling. Even in failure, Challenges create tension and drama, pushing the story forward through consequences rather than stopping it in its tracks. Whenever possible, failing a Challenge should create complications or new opportunities, not dead ends.\n\nFor guidance on setting DCs and examples of creative Skill Set applications, see page XX.\n\n### Bonuses and Stacking\n\nBonuses from the same source do not stack; instead, you always use the highest bonus applicable to the situation. Sources include ability scores, power scores, powers, features, feats, and circumstances.\n\nFor example, if you have two feats that provide bonuses to Stealth checks, one offering a +1 bonus to all Stealth checks and the other providing a +2 bonus in urban environments, you would benefit from the +2 bonus while in urban environments and the +1 bonus in all other situations.\n\n### Rounding Down\n\nWhenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.\n\n### Specific Rules Beat General Rules\n\nIf a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins. For example, a general rule is that creatures can move a number of areas equal to their Pace, but powers can allow you to surpass that number, sometimes by quite a bit.\n\n## Plot Points\n\nRemember how we talked about the narrative being a primary driver over simulation-style play? Plot Points provide us with the mechanics that allow us to encourage just that. They empower players to help create, shape, and enhance the story. Whether altering a scene, overcoming challenges, or pushing beyond their limits, Plot Points put narrative control into the players' hands, fostering creativity and dynamic storytelling. But be careful—Plot Points spent end up in the hands of the Editor-in-Chief, who can use them to give the villains an edge. For more information on **Plot Points,** see page XX\n\n# Supporting Cast and Bystanders\n\nZombie survival stories are always more about the survivors than taking down the zombies. At the end of character creation and before the first game, you, the editor-in-chief, and the other players create a cast of **Supporting Characters** together, with each player creating two non-powered individuals who have a personal connection with their Hero. The player creating their Supporting Characters can choose to give them helpful skill sets, while other players can propose personality flaws. Beyond the **Supporting Cast,** the heroes can come across or even start playing with additional **bystanders** as part of their enclave, as determined by the editor-in-chief. For more information on the Supporting Cast, see page XX.\n","size_bytes":36209},"docs/2.1_Character Creation 8.2.md":{"content":"Chapter 1: Hero\n\n## Hero Creation: Making a B-Lister, one step at a time.\n\nBefore diving headlong into the world of rotted capes, you need to define your character. Were you once a scrappy sidekick to a famous hero? The bird to someone’s bat? Or were you a young, upcoming hero seeking to join a famous league of avenging heroes? Or a street-level hero looking to take down an organized crime syndicate? Or maybe you took up the mask after Z’day, hoping to find the bravery to face what lies ahead while inspiring the few survivors left.   \n  \nBut in the end, does it all even matter after everyone was Z’d? That’s for you to decide.\n\nEnough small talk.\n\nLet’s get to work.\n\n## Select an Origin\n\nWhat are you? Where do your powers come from?\n\nAre you a Super-Human? Perhaps the next step of human evolution or the result of bioengineering or a freak accident? An alien who crash-landed on Earth and is now stranded in a strange world, struggling to survive? Or you may be an exceptionally skilled hero relying on almost superhuman abilities and superior training to win the day. Or a Tech Hero piloting a custom-designed suit of power armor or utilizing a belt full of useful, custom-made gadgetry. Or maybe your hero is a demigod, the Son of Horus, hunting down the most dangerous prey ever to walk the earth!\n\nEach origin grants you a bonus to your starting ability scores, Origin Features, and disadvantages.\n\n## Select an Archetype\n\nWhat kind of hero are you?\n\nAre you a powerfully built hero smashing zombie skulls with your fists and sending them flying, or do you manifest bolts of fire blasting things from afar? Maybe you’re a shadow, moving unseen? Maybe you are a quick, agile scrapper with razor-sharp claws.\n\nEach Archetype grants you a bonus to your starting ability scores and a list of typical powers; typical powers represent your Archetype’s bailiwick but are not the only powers they can learn.\n\nArchetypes encompass the most general of themes. Don’t be discouraged if the exact Hero you had envisioned does not fall neatly into any of these categories. Just pick the best fit and move on from there.\n\n## Determine your ability scores.\n\nYour ability scores represent your hero’s attributes, how strong, fast, quick, and wise they are.\n\nHere, you are given points to allocate across 6 ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma. After which, you apply ability score bonuses granted by both your archetypes and origin.\n\n## Choose your Powers.\n\nSo, what can your hero do? Do they have telekinetic powers? Are you an ex-super spy with training that borders on the unnatural? An ex-billionaire playboy philanthropist flying around in a suit of armor now being held together by duct tape and positive thoughts?\n\nYou get a number of points to buy your powers and determine their starting power score. Afterward, you may apply power perks and flaws, increasing or decreasing each power’s final power score.\n\n## Do you have a weakness?\n\nIs your hero violently allergic to a rare kind of metal? Do all your powers suddenly burn out when hit with a Sonic attack? Or maybe your hero has an uncontrollable fear of heights.\n\nEach weakness grants you the choice of an ability score bonus, a power score bonus, or a feat. If you do not want a weakness, you can skip this step.\n\n## Define your skill sets and pick your starting feat.\n\nWhat does your hero know how to do? Maybe they will have some medical training or know their way around an old diesel engine. Here we define two Skill Sets that represent your hero’s background, training, or unique talents.\n\nOnce you’ve selected your Skill Sets, pick a starting feat that complements or enhances them. Feats are special tricks, talents, or training that give your hero an edge, whether that’s being quicker on the draw, better at jury-rigging field repairs, or a natural at reading people.\n\n## The Finishing Touches.\n\nAlmost there….\n\nHere you choose your starting gear, determine your defenses, pace, starting vitality, wounds, and two of the most important details like your *character’s flaws* and your *tagline.*\n\n## The Supporting Cast\n\nYou’re a hero but not alone; people have a habit of following heroes. Maybe you saved them from a pack of z’s, and maybe they saved you. Regardless you are in this together.\n\nHere you create your supporting cast, each with their skills and training. Useful? Yes, but sometimes they can be a liability, and such is the life of a hero.\n\n# Step 1: Choose an Origin\n\nYour Origin defines the source of your extraordinary abilities and the means through which you achieve your heroic feats. You might be a supremely skilled hero, relying on nearly superhuman talents and rigorous training to triumph. Alternatively, you could be a Tech Hero, commanding a suit of power armor or wielding an arsenal of specially designed gadgets. Or perhaps you are a Super-Human, either the product of advanced bio-engineering or the outcome of a fateful, transformative accident, or just representing the next stage in human evolution.\n\nEach power source grants the hero Origin Features: s and disadvantages and a bonus to a specific attribute.\n\nOrigins are not the only source of your heroes’ powers. You may have other powers gained through other means, such as being a super-human with enhanced speed and agility wielding wrist blasters made of some alien tech.\n\n\\<side bar\\>  \n*Character creation ride-along: Step 1: choosing your Origin.*   \nRuben is a big fan of heroes who use Telekinetic powers, so he chooses to go with the super-human Origin.\n\nRuben sees the Super-Human Origin grant him a +2 bonus to his Constitution. Additionally, he notes his *Raw Potential* Foundation Feature, as well as noting his Foundation Limitations *Power Limits.*   \n  \nNani is a particular fan of Norse mythology, so she chooses to go with a demigod.\n\nNani sees that the Demi-God Origin grants her a +1 bonus to any two ability scores or a +2 bonus to one. She chooses +1 to Strength and Constitution and looks at her Foundation Feature, “*Divine Blood, Divine Power”* which has three options, and she decides to go with *Divine Presence.* After which, she notes Foundation Limitation: *Divine power limits.*\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n## Alien\n\nYou are not of this world. Whether you hail from a distant planet, are a member of an extraterrestrial race, or from another dimension, your origins lie beyond. Your alien nature grants you unique abilities and perspectives that set you apart from humanity.\n\nPerhaps you arrived on Earth as an ambassador of your people, or maybe you were stranded here, your spacecraft damaged beyond repair, forcing you to adapt to survive. Regardless of the circumstances, you are now a stranger in a strange land, facing the dual challenges of the zombie apocalypse and the mysteries of this new world.\n\nYour alien heritage brings both advantages and challenges. You may possess advanced technology, telepathic abilities, or physical attributes beyond human limits. However, you also grapple with the struggle of finding your place among humans, building trust, and understanding their customs and culture.  \n  \n**Ability Score Bonus:**\n\nAs an Alien, you might possess enhanced physiology or a significantly advanced mind\n\n\\+2 to one of the following (your choice): Strength, Intelligence, or Wisdom\n\n**Origin Foundation Feature:   \n***Your mind processes data in strange, nonlinear ways.*\n\nYou may reroll any failed Intelligence-based Skill Set challenge, recovering the ability to do so after completing a Hiatus (must keep the new result).\n\nAdditionally, you gain a passive bonus: you can read or decipher alien or unknown languages if you have context clues or time to observe. (This is not an instant translation, more like narrative-level Rosetta Stone intuition.)\n\n**Origin Limitations:   \n***Cultural Misfit:* You have Disadvantage with all initial social interactions with non-Bystanders who know you're alien unless you have earned their trust.\n\n*Stranger on Earth:* During character creation, if you possess Earth-based Skill Sets (e.g., Streetwise, Black-Market Runner), you may not begin with gain any Edge with that skill set\n\n**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.\n\n| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Alien Adaptation                  |\n| Alien Physiology                  |\n| Alien Technology Expert           |\n| Ethereal Connection               |\n| Enhanced Strength                 |\n| Unearthly Speed                   |\n| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n| Alien Empathy                     |\n| Alien Physiology                  |\n| Alien Technology Specialist       |\n| Cosmic Beacon                     |\n\n#### B-Lister Rank Origin Features\n\n**Alien Adaptation:** You have DR: 1 vs. one damage type you choose. This DR stacks with DR from other sources.\n\n**Alien Physiology:** Increase your Constitution score and another ability score of your choice by 1; you may take this feature multiple times.\n\n**Alien Technology Expert:** Choose an applicable Skill Set (e.g., Xeno-Tech, Technophile, Engineering Prodigy) that aligns with your alien background. You may define an Edge within that Skill Set, reflecting your off-world expertise in identifying, repairing, or repurposing advanced tech.\n\nThis Edge must relate to alien systems, energy matrices, dimensional interfaces, or similarly advanced concepts and is subject to approval by the Editor-in-Chief.\n\n**Enhanced Strength:** You possess incredible strength, allowing you to lift and carry heavy objects easily. Your strength score is doubled to determine how much you can lift, carry, or drag. You also have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.\n\n**Ethereal Connection:** Increase the power score of any two of your inborn powers by 1; you may take this feature multiple times.\n\n**Unearthly Speed:** Your unearthly agility and reflexes grant you incredible speed. You can now apply your total dexterity modifier to your pace score (ignoring the cap of 5 areas). Additionally, you may increase your pace by 1 area or gain a +1 to your avoidance. You can choose this feature twice to gain both options.\n\n#### A-Lister Rank Origin Features\n\n**Cosmic Beacon**: Your alien presence emits a unique cosmic energy that can empower or disrupt other beings. Once per scene, as a bonus action, when within 2 areas of another powered creature, you may modify the power score of any of their abilities by +2 or -2 until the end of their next turn.\n\n**Alien Empathy:** Your cosmic connection allows you to sense and understand the emotions and intentions of other beings. You gain a +2 bonus to your Charisma checks when attempting to persuade, deceive, or empathize with creatures.\n\n**Alien Physiology:** You gain the life support power at a power rank equal to your charisma score. If you already possess this power, it increases to match your charisma score or is increased by +4 if already higher than your charisma score.\n\n**Alien Technology Specialist:** You can quickly kit-bash alien technology on the fly if you have some raw materials to work with. As a Demanding Action, you may quickly put together a piece of jury-rigged alien technology. This item possesses the power of Dynamic Power, with a power score equal to your Intelligence score, and requires an external power source, as well as the removable object power flaws. Any object you kit bash in this way lasts until the end of the scene, at which point it deactivates, melts down, or burns out. You regain the use of this ability after completing a Hiatus.\n\n## Android\n\nYou are some form of mechanical creation, be it a self-aware robot, an artificially-constructed human, or even a human brain in a cybernetic body. You have an inorganic makeup and are relatively immune to most diseases. Making you a *very* valuable member of any enclave. However, that said….\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\nEditor’s Note:   \nBeing immune to infection may make the Android *too* effective for the zombie apocalypse. You may want to consider the possibility of a machine-based virus allowing for mechanical zombies. See “Zombies and Non-Humans,” p. XX, for more options.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n**Ability Score Bonus:**\n\nAndroids might be diverse in their design and programming parameters, but it is their digital minds that make it all possible. You gain +2 to your Intelligence score.\n\n**Origin Foundation Feature:   \n***Modular Redundancy:* Your systems are layered with fail-safes and backups.\n\n-   You may reroll one failed Constitution or Dexterity saving throw per Issue, reflecting your ability to reroute power or reinforce structure.\n-   Additionally, you do not suffer fatigue from lack of sleep, hunger, or exhaustion unless your systems are damaged.\n\n**Origin Flaw:**\n\n*Lack of Emotion:* You suffer a Disadvantage on all checks to read or empathize with others emotionally (e.g., skill sets that lend themselves to having unique insights or heightened Empathy).\n\n**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.\n\n| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Adaptive Learning                 |\n| Adaptive Modifications            |\n| Data Analysis                     |\n| Enhanced Capabilities             |\n| Enhanced Durability               |\n| Enhanced Strength                 |\n| Self-Repair                       |\n| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n| Combat Computer                   |\n| Digital Mind Interface            |\n| Tactical Combat Records           |\n\n#### B-Lister Rank Origin Features\n\n**Adaptive Learning:** You gain an additional skill set.\n\n**Adaptive Modifications:** Increase your Intelligence score and another ability score of your choice by 1. You may take this feature multiple times.\n\n**Data Analysis:** Choose one Skill Set related to data processing or tactical analysis (e.g., Tactician, Strategist, Technophile, or Scholar). You may define a specialized Edge within that Skill Set related to analyzing data, spotting patterns, or predicting outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, once per scene, you may ask the Editor-in-Chief to reveal a hidden clue, weakness, or tactical insight related to a scene, creature, or problem, as long as your hero has had at least a moment to observe or review information. The Editor should provide a hint or detail that rewards your logical interpretation.\n\n**Enhanced Capabilities:** Increase the power score of any two of your inborn powers by 1. You may take this feature multiple times.\n\n**Enhanced Durability:** You have DR: 1 vs. all physical damage. This DR stacks with DR from other sources.\n\n**Enhanced Strength:** You possess incredible strength, allowing you to lift and carry heavy objects easily. Your strength score is doubled to determine how much you can lift, carry, or drag. You also have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.\n\n**Self-Repair:** Your android body can repair itself over time. When you heal a wound, you heal two instead.\n\n#### A-Lister Rank Origin Features\n\n**Combat Computer:** As a bonus action, you can dedicate most of your processing power to your combat computer, allowing it to take control. While in your combat computer is active, the following benefits apply for 1 minute:\n\n-   *Wired Reflexes:* You gain advantage on all attack rolls.\n-   *Precision:* Your attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage of the same type.\n-   *Telemetry Data:* you gain a +1 bonus to your Avoidance.\n\n    After using this feature, you wait 1 week before using it again. You may retake this feature when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category, reducing the time between uses to a Hiatus.\n\n    **Digital Mind Interface:** You can wirelessly connect to computer systems to easily access information and control technology. You gain the Wireless power at a power score equal to your Intelligence score. If you already have the wireless power, increase your power score in that power by +4 if the score is higher than your intelligence score.\n\n    **Tactical Combat Records:** After fighting a creature type or individual for 2 rounds, you gain a +1 bonus to hit and a +1 bonus to your defenses when facing them. You may retain data on as many creatures as your intelligence bonus.\n\n## Cosmic\n\nYou can tap into and channel the energies that permeate the universe. How you gained these powers is up to you, but you might possess an alien artifact that draws upon such energies or may someone have granted you these powers to help keep law and order in this small section of the universe. However, despite your origin, you’re still a B-Lister and only possess a fraction of the power cosmically enhanced A-Listers can sling around. In other words, no flying through space unaided, defending entire solar systems all by yourself, or destroying starships with a single energy blast. And worse yet, you’re now trapped in a world overrun by the living dead. Your starship may be damaged, your interstellar flight ring has gone missing, or with your mentor gone, you have sworn to eradicate the zombie threat in their memory.\n\nThe reason doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you’re in for the long haul and are here to stay.\n\n**Ability Bonus:**   \nComic beings come in many shapes, but the rigors of being a vessel for such power demand a level of durability. You gain +1 to your Constitution and one other ability score of your choice.\n\n**Origin Foundation Feature:   \n***Singularity of Power:* Your energy source is vast but contained, a star-forged battery, an extradimensional core, or the will of a celestial entity. It defines you completely.\n\n-   Choose one of your powers. This power becomes your **Core Power**.\n-   You gain a +2 bonus to the Power Score of your **Core Power**.\n-   Additionally, you gain Advantage on any Power checks directly involving your Core Power’s effects.\n\n**Origin Limitations:**\n\n*Power Limits:* At hero creation, all your powers must share the same energy source. If the source of your cosmic powers is an item, then all your powers must be part of that object, and all share the same burnout threshold. After hero creation, you can only gain new inborn powers through mastering emulated powers based on your existing inborn powers.\n\nLater, with Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may acquire new powers, but none of them can be Inborn powers; they must be made available through technology, supernatural, or some other external source. Certain story-based events, such as exposure to a nuclear reactor, massive amounts of solar radiation, or other such esoteric energies, *may* allow you to acquire new inborn powers.\n\n**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.\n\n| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Cosmic Adaptation                 |\n| Cosmic Awareness                  |\n| Cosmic Ascendance                 |\n| Cosmic Evolution                  |\n| Cosmic Resistance                 |\n| Infinite Cosmic Power             |\n| Power Mastery                     |\n| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n| Cosmic Entanglement               |\n| Cosmic Transformation             |\n| Stellar Manipulation              |\n\n#### B-Lister Level Origin Features\n\n**Cosmic Adaptation:** Adapt to various environments and conditions in space, such as extreme temperatures or lack of oxygen. You gain the power of Life Support: 40. This power is limited to space, allowing you to exist and operate in the extreme temperatures and vacuum of space.\n\n**Cosmic Awareness:** Your connection to the cosmos grants you heightened senses and the ability to detect hidden threats or sources of power. You can sense the use of cosmic-based powers or events within a number of miles equal to your wisdom bonus. You can gauge the general power level classification of the cosmic event with a successful Wisdom Check vs. a DC: 20, -5 for each power level classification above Gamma, so gauging a Theta level event would require a DC 5 Charisma Check.\n\n**Cosmic Ascendance:** Increase the power score of any two of your cosmic powers by +1. You may take this feature multiple times.\n\n**Cosmic Evolution:** Increase your Constitution score and another ability score of your choice by 1. You may take this feature multiple times.\n\n**Cosmic Resistance:** You have DR 1 vs. cosmic-based attacks and effects, stacks with other effects. You may choose this feature more than once, gaining a +1 each additional time you take this feature to a maximum of +5.\n\n**Infinite Cosmic Power:** Increase your burnout threshold by 2\n\n**Power Mastery:** Choose a power feat.\n\n#### A-Lister Level Origin Features\n\n**Cosmic Entanglement:** All cosmic-level heroes tap into the same reserves. You have learned how to manipulate the flow of the cosmic, empowering or disempowering those around you that tap into that power. Once per scene, as a bonus action, when within 2 areas of another cosmic-powered creature, you may modify the power score of any of their Cosmic themed powers by +2 or -2 until the end of their next turn.\n\n**Cosmic Transformation:** Tapping into the cosmic power, you unleash your true potential and undergo a temporary transformation. You can activate Cosmic Transformation as a bonus action. While in your cosmic form, the following benefits apply for 1 minute:\n\n-   *Advantage on Attacks:* You gain advantage on all attack rolls.\n-   *Resilience:* You have advantage on all saving throws and ability checks.\n-   *Cosmic Overcharge:* Choose one of your cosmic powers, and that power’s score is increased by +4\n\n    After using this feature, you wait 1 week before using it again. You may retake this feature when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category, reducing the time between uses to a Hiatus.\n\n    **Stellar Manipulation:** Harness the power of stars to unleash devastating energy attacks. You gain the Energy Manipulation (Cosmic) power with a power score equal to your Charisma score. If you already have the Energy Manipulation (Cosmic) power, increase your power score in that power by +4 if the score is higher than your Charisma score.\n\n## Demigod\n\nYou are a ‘divine’ being. Or at least you claim to be. It is possible you’re the result of the union between a god and a mortal, or you may be the avatar of such a being, sent to Earth to work its will. Before Z-Day, other superheroes figured you were either a powerful alien, a deluded mutant, another form of superhuman, a visitor from another dimension, or a walking example of ‘any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.’ After Z-Day, all that mattered was that you were alive and could deal with the zombie threat.\n\n**Ability Bonus:**   \nDemigods are as different as the deities of the varied pantheons; you get a +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice or +1 to any two ability scores of your choice.\n\n**Origin Foundation Feature:**\n\n*Divine Blood, Divine Power:*\n\nYou carry the spark of divinity, whether it manifests as strength, presence, or foresight, depends on your lineage. Choose one of the following benefits:\n\n-   **Mighty Lineage:** You possess incredible strength, allowing you to lift and carry heavy objects easily. Your strength score is doubled to determine how much you can lift, carry, or drag. You also have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.\n-   **Divine Presence:** You gain Advantage on all social Skill Set challenges when interacting with mortals who recognize your divine heritage (fear, awe, or reverence).\n-   **Prophetic Insight:** Once per Issue, when you fail a d20 roll, you may declare you foresaw this outcome and reroll the die. You must accept the new result.\n\n**Origin Foundation Limitations:**\n\n*Divine Power Limits:* After character creation, at least half of your powers must be Inborn Powers, with all other powers being tied to one supernatural object. You can only gain new inborn powers through mastering emulated powers based on your existing inborn powers.\n\nLater, with Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may acquire new powers, but none of them can be Inborn powers; they must be made available through technology, supernatural, or some other external source. Of course, certain story-based events tied to your Demigod’s mythological theme may allow you to gain new inborn powers.\n\n**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.\n\n| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Divine Ascendance                 |\n| Divine Blessing                   |\n| Divine Bloodline                  |\n| Divine Presence                   |\n| Divine Sense                      |\n| Enhanced Strength                 |\n| Unearthly Speed                   |\n| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n| Divine Intervention               |\n| Divine Transformation             |\n| Divine Resistance                 |\n\n#### B-Lister Level Origin Features\n\n**Divine Ascendance:** Increase the power score of any two of your inborn powers by 1. You may take this feature multiple times.\n\n**Divine Blessing:** The gods smile upon you, granting you a permanent boon. Choose one of the following benefits: +1 bonus to avoidance, +1 grit, or +1 to all attack rolls. This benefit cannot be changed once chosen.\n\n**Divine Bloodline:** Increase the ability score or scores modified by your origin during hero creation by 2 or 1, respectively. You may take this feature multiple times. For example, if you choose to increase Strength by +2 during hero creation, you gain a +2 to strength when choosing this feature.\n\n**Divine Presence:** Your presence exudes an aura of power and authority, influencing the behavior of others and benefiting in social interactions. You gain a +2 bonus when attempting to meet a challenge to influence others. You may take this feature multiple times, gaining a +1 each additional time you take this feature to a maximum of +5.\n\n**Divine Sense:** Your connection to the divine allows you to sense the presence of undead creatures. As a bonus action, you can detect the location of any undead within 30 feet, even through walls and obstacles.\n\n**Enhanced Strength:** You possess incredible strength, allowing you to lift and carry heavy objects easily. Your strength score is doubled to determine how much you can lift, carry, or drag. You also have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.\n\n**Unearthly Speed:** Your unearthly agility and reflexes grant you incredible speed. You can now apply your total dexterity modifier to your pace score (ignoring the cap of 5 areas). Additionally, you may increase your pace by 1 area or gain a +1 to your avoidance. You can choose this feature twice to gain both options.\n\n#### A-Lister Level Origin Features\n\n**Divine Intervention:** You can call upon the divine power within you to alter the course of events. When making a saving throw, you can choose to roll with advantage. You regain the use of this feature after completing a Hiatus.\n\n**Divine Transformation:** Embracing your divine lineage, you can tap into your true potential and undergo a temporary transformation. You can activate Divine Transformation as a bonus action. While in your divine form, the following benefits apply for 1 minute:\n\n-   *Advantage on Attacks:* You gain advantage on all attack rolls.\n-   *Resilience:* You have advantage on all saving throws and ability checks.\n-   *Divine Weaponry:* When attacking with a weapon or unarmed attack, once per turn, you deal an additional 1d6 damage.\n\n    After using this feature, you wait 1 week before using it again. You may retake this feature when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category, reducing the time between uses to a Hiatus.\n\n    **Divine Resistance:** Your divine heritage grants you resistance to a specific damage type associated with your divine parentage. Choose one damage type (e.g., fire, lightning, necrotic) and gain DR 2 against that damage type. You may take this feature multiple times, gaining a +1 each additional time you take this feature to a maximum of +5.\n\n## Highly Trained\n\nYes, it was hard for you to make a name for yourself; you can’t fly, dodge bullets, or build a battle suit that would have allowed you to face down the likes of the Raptor or Inferno, but what you lacked in raw power you more than made up for in hard earned skill.\n\nAt one time, you may have been a highly trained field agent for the NSA or The Division, or maybe you were a uniquely gifted martial artist trained in almost forgotten techniques by a solitary master, or perhaps you were a rich millionaire utilizing almost limitless resources, ruthless training, and an unbreakable will to forge yourself into more than an ordinary man.\n\nRegardless of how you trained your body to become the hero you are today, you face a threat you could have never foreseen. And you thought you had it hard when your enemies were breathing…\n\n**Ability Bonus:** Skill-based heroes are a varied lot; they gain a +1 bonus to any three attributes of their choice.\n\n**Origin Foundation Features:**\n\n*My knowledge is my power:* Once you reach step 4 during hero creation, you get to choose an additional feat or an additional skill set.\n\n**Origin Foundation Limitation:**\n\n*Only Human:* You are ultimately only human; you may never increase your physical attributes (before applying powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.\n\n*No Powers:* You do not possess any inborn powers; therefore, any power must be skill-based or the result of specialized equipment. Powers marked with a (\\*) in Archetypes and later in the Powers section may be attributed to specialized training. If you choose these as powers, they must possess the *All-Skill* Power Modification. Any other powers are the result of custom technology; thus, they require the External Power Source and either *Cybernetic Implants* or *Removable Item* Power Modifications.\n\n**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.\n\n| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Acrobatic Mastery                 |\n| Advanced Training                 |\n| Focused Training                  |\n| Skill Mastery                     |\n| Skill Training                    |\n| Tactical Analysis                 |\n| Tactical Maneuvers                |\n| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n| Flawless Execution                |\n| Flow state                        |\n| Resourcefulness                   |\n\n#### B-Lister Level Origin Features\n\n**Acrobatic Mastery:** Your exceptional agility and acrobatic skills allow you to navigate the battlefield with finesse. You may take the disengage action as a bonus action.\n\n**Advanced Training:** Choose a feat; you may take this feature multiple times.\n\n**Focused Training:** Choose one Skill Set you already possess. You may define two narrative specialties that become unique Edges for that Skill Set.\n\nThese two narrative specialties, brief phrases like “Urban Tracking,” “Lock Safes,” or “Forensic Autopsy,”\n\nThis feature may be taken multiple times.\n\n**Skill Mastery:** Choose one of your Skill Sets. Whenever you use your chosen skill set to meet a challenge, you gain an additional +1 to die roll.\n\nYou may take this feature multiple times, improving this bonus by +1 to a maximum of +3\n\n**Cross Training:** Choose an additional skill set. You only apply half your rank bonus to all rolls involving this skill set. All edges under this skill set gain your full rank bonus, instead of double.\n\n**Tactical Analysis:** Your keen intellect and training in strategy make you a master tactician. Once per Hiatus, before the initiative is rolled, you can give one friendly creature that can see and hear you a +5 bonus to their initiative roll.\n\n**Uncanny Precision:** Choose one weapon type (e.g., pistol, assault rifle, baton, longsword) that your hero has trained with extensively. You may gain double your rank bonus when attacking with this weapon, you may choose this feature more than once, choosing a different weapon each time.\n\n#### A-Lister Level Origin Features\n\n**Flawless Execution:** Your meticulous planning and execution make your attacks deadly and efficient. Once per scene, when you hit with a weapon attack, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling for damage.\n\n**Flow state:** In combat, your highly trained skills and focused mindset allow you to enter a state of heightened awareness and precision. You can activate Flow State as a bonus action. While in Flow State, the following benefits apply for 1 minute:\n\n-   *Hyper Focus:* You gain advantage on all skill checks and attack rolls.\n-   *I saw that coming:* As a reaction, in response to an attack which you are aware of impose disadvantage the triggering attack.\n-   *Single-minded:* You gain a +2 bonus to your Willpower Defense and advantage on all Wisdom saving throws.\n\n    After using this feature, you wait 1 week before using it again. You may retake this feature when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category, reducing the time between uses to a Hiatus.\n\n    **Resourcefulness:** You are skilled at improvising and making the best use of your surroundings, granting your insight when involving creative problem-solving. You can reroll any failed check when trying to meet a challenge.\n\n## Mystic\n\nYou are one of the rarest heroes, a mystic arts practitioner, or a mystic power wielder. You might be a magician calling ancient powers and bending them to your will, or an ancient artifact may have chosen you to wield its power for a greater purpose, or a master of mystical gadgetry.\n\nBefore Z-Day, you may have used your knowledge to fight crime under the guise of a stage magician, acted as a private investigator of the occult, or defended the Earth from extradimensional invaders. You may have even taken to wearing a colorful costume and fighting alongside more traditional (at least in the public mind) heroes. In any event, you were considered an oddity, even among the other heroes. Scientists may try to quantify your power source, while others would dismiss your claims as theater to invoke your heroic persona. But after Z-Day, does it matter anymore? Depending on the cause of the Zombie Apocalypse chosen by the Editor, you may be one of the people best equipped to deal with the apocalypse. Zombies (and other forms are undead) are often par for the course for many mystic masters.\n\nThe problem here, however, is that there are so many zombies. More unsettling is the silence that has settled onto the supernatural side of the world. You would have thought the deaths of so many would have caused an increase in apparitions and ghosts of the world. Instead, there is an uneasy quiet. In addition, you can now “feel” the waves of mystic power far more quickly than before as it flows readily through you. It is so accessible that you’d think it was building itself up in anticipation, but for what?\n\n\\<side Bar\\>\n\n### Superheroic Sorcery\n\nAt first glance, superheroes and sorcery may seem like an odd mix, but magic-using and magic-powered superheroes date back to the first costumed crime fighters. Thus, when playing *Rotted Capes,* you and the Editor-in-Chief must consider the nature of magic and magical characters in your campaign.\n\nFor starters, superheroic magicians tend to look and dress differently than your typical costumed crime fighter. Skin-tight costumes tend to be reasonably rare, replaced with trench coats, tunics, top hats, capes and cloaks, and so on. And even if they wear a skin-tight costume, the superheroic sorcerer tends to have or use some distinctive artifact that marks them as a magician, such as an enchanted helmet, a “spell sword,” or a power-channeling staff. Finally, such heroes also have codenames that reflect the nature of their powers. For example, there are a *lot* of Doctors slinging spells in the comics.\n\nNext, we need to consider the nature of superheroic spellcasting. Much of it tends to be akin to *thaumaturgy* or “wonder-working.” In other words, comic book magicians work miracles through their spells and spellcraft. However, very few comic book magicians cast their spells the same way as other magicians. Usually, each hero has a specific technique for creating their magical effects. Some speak their spells backward, saying “tlob gninthgil!” when they want to produce a bolt of electricity. Others use alliterative phrasing, calling upon “hoary hosts” and the like.\n\nStill, others channel their magic through specific objects, such as wands, the aforementioned enchanted helmet, or amulets. By determining this, you start to bring your hero to life and differentiate them from regular costumed supers and other magically-powered characters. That said, first check with your Editor-in-Chief to see if he has any specific ideas on how magic works in his game. He may give you his outlines for spells or, better yet, might take your ideas and adopt them whole cloth.\n\nOnce you know how you cast spells, you need to decide what your spells look like. As comics are a visual medium, comic book super mages tend to have showy side effects to their spells. When creating magic, their hands are often surrounded by such effects as great globes of light, bands or rings, elaborate mandalas, or intricate patterns of lines. Magical artifacts glow when used, often with unusual or unnatural colors.\n\nCombat spells tend to go beyond the “mundane” energy/ element blasts of regular superheroes. They may manifest as a multitude of energy darts, a burning animal shape, or any number of similar effects. Defensive spells often spark or shine when struck or radiate the same effects mentioned when creating spells if an attack hits home.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that, unlike regular superheroes, super mages aren’t manipulating real-world energies. They’re working with magical energies, which means they can do things in highly unconventional ways. For example, a regular superhero may perform a Geospatial Shift by traveling at super speed, manipulating time, or converting their mass to energy and back again. On the other hand, a super mage may cut a rift in the “veil between worlds,” shift from our world to a different dimension, and then back, or simply will themselves there. These kinds of effects apply to *everything* a superheroic magician can do and go hand-in-hand with the idea that superheroic spell casting needs to be showy and visually distinct.\n\nOf course, in a zombie apocalypse, showy spell casting might *not* be the best of ideas, as it might draw unwanted attention to you and your companions, but that’s the price you pay for mastery of the mystic arts.\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>\n\n**There are three basic types of mystic heroes:**\n\n*Practitioners* are the magi, the wielders of magic. These heroes derive their powers through mystical rituals requiring an almost inhuman dedication.\n\n*The Chosen* are those heroes who have been blessed by either mystical beings from beyond the planes of man or those who have been chosen by a powerful magical item that empowers them with their abilities.\n\n*Enchanters* are those heroes who come at magic differently, sometimes called *mystic gadgeteers.* These heroes create fantastic instruments which are cable of doing fantastic things.\n\n### Practitioners\n\n**Ability Bonus:**\n\n*Practitioners* get where they are through constant study and self-Willpower, which allows them a +2 to their Charisma score.\n\n**Origin Foundation Features:**\n\n*Bell, Book, and Candle:* To represent your training in the mystic arts, you choose *Occult Arcanist* as one of your skill sets, and you also gain the *Occult Scholar* feat for free.\n\n*Unseen Truths*: The mystic arts reveal things beyond mortal understanding; secrets etched into the bones of the world. Whether through ritual, trance, cards, stars, or whispers in the dark, you can ask the universe for guidance.\n\nOnce per Issue, you may perform a short ritual (as simple as muttering a chant, reading a sign, or casting runes) to ask the Editor-in-Chief a question about the current situation, creature, or threat. The Editor must answer with either:\n\n-   A concrete truth,\n-   A useful hint, or\n-   A cryptic omen tied to your question.\n\nAdditionally, when making any Skill Set check related to the supernatural, arcane, divine, or cursed objects/forces, you gain Advantage if you have time to perform a minor ritual or speak with spirits/entities before acting.\n\n**Origin Foundation Limitation:**\n\n*Only Human:* Despite your mystic Might, you’re ultimately only human; you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before the application of powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.\n\n*Gremlins:* All mystic heroes seem to have problems with technology; mystic heroes gain Gremlins as an additional personality flaw. Your editor-in-chief may activate this flaw to refuse its effects; you must spend a plot point.\n\n*Spell Slinger:* As a wielder of the mystic arts, you do not possess powers, but rather cast spells. When choosing a power, it is instead considered a spell and must have the Magical Spell perk (see page xx). Spells that you have memorized or otherwise know are considered inborn powers. All other spells must have the removable flaw, such as being written in a tome or linked to an object that could be lost mid-battle.\n\n### Enchanters\n\n**Ability Bonus:**\n\n*Enchanters* see the world in ways others cannot even imagine; thus, they gain +2 to their Intelligence score.\n\n**Origin Foundation Features:**\n\n*Mystech Artificer:* You fuse ritual magic with engineering, enchanting everyday items into arcane tools of power. Whether you're a run-slinger, wand-hacker, or sigil-plumber, your creations run on your soul.\n\n-   During hero creation, you must choose *Arcane Engineer* (or a similar themed) Skill Set as one of your starting Skill Sets.\n-   Once per Issue, you may declare that you’ve pre-enchanted a mundane item on your person, imbuing it with a single use of any known power you possess. If you use this item, you use the power imbued into the item but do so without retaining any burnout for the power use, destroying the item's enchantment\n-   Additionally, during your Enclave Interlude, you can repair or replace any one of your lost or broken magical items that possessed powers through the removable item flaw. Alternately, at the editor-in-chief’s discretion, you may repair or replace such a magical item possessed by an ally.\n\n**Origin Foundation Limitations:**\n\n*Only Human:* Despite your mystic might, you’re ultimately only human; you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before applying powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.\n\n*So many Toys:* Your powers come from multiple pieces of equipment that share one power source: you. During hero creation, all your powers must result from items; as such, your powers cannot have the external power source power modifications and must possess the Removable Item power modification (fully explained under powers pg. XX). Additionally, you may learn the Inventive Gadgetry power, but items created using this power do not have an external power source or modification. Instead, they tap into your arcane power; as such, you pay the burnout cost when activating the item's power.\n\n*Techno-Shaman:* Technology reaches out for you. Unexplained technological phenomenon springs up wherever you go. You might be able to work wonders with a computer, but that computer is just as likely to turn on you. Beware, for there are ghosts in the machine who are hungry for someone like you, someone attuned to their world. Your editor-in-chief may activate this flaw; you may refuse its effects, but to do so, you must spend a plot point.\n\n### The Chosen\n\n**Ability Bonus:**\n\n*The Chosen* are typically selected because they possess an unorthodox way of seeing things; thus, they gain +2 to their Wisdom score.\n\n**Origin Foundation Features:**\n\n*Marked by Destiny:* You are the chosen vessel of a force far beyond you, a cosmic balance, a slumbering god, a relic forged for a forgotten war. Whether you embrace or resist your fate, you are never truly alone.\n\n-   You gain a +1 bonus to your Grit.\n-   Once per Issue, when you would be reduced to 0 Stamina or suffer a Wound, you may instead call upon your fate. You remain at 1 Stamina or negate the Wound and immediately gain enough Burnout to meet your burnout threshold or that of your bonded magical item (see set path below)\n\n**Origin Foundation Flaws:**\n\n*Only Human:* Despite your mystic might, you’re ultimately only human; you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before the application of powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.\n\n*A Set Path:* At character creation, you must choose one of the following:\n\n-   **Bound Artifact:** All of your powers originate from a specific item you possess (e.g., a magic sword, book, or relic). These powers must have the External Power Source power modification.\n-   **Mystic Patron:** Your powers are granted by a supernatural patron (e.g., a god, demon, ancestor, cosmic force). These powers must have the Patron power modification.\n\n*Power Limits:* After hero creation, you can only acquire new powers by emulating them from your known powers, and you may also learn new powers by applying the all skill modification, which represents advanced physical training.\n\n**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.\n\n| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features**            |\n|----------------------------------------------|\n| Deep Knowledge                               |\n| Eldritch Endurance (The Chosin only)         |\n| Eldritch Sense                               |\n| Eureka!

Choose a Skill Set related to supernatural knowledge (e.g., Occultist, Scholar, Arcane Engineer). You may define a specialized Edge tied to recalling or identifying magical artifacts, supernatural creatures, or arcane phenomena using that Skill Set.\n\nWhen using this Edge, you also gain an Advantage on your skill set check.\n\n**Eldritch Endurance (The Chosin only):** For a fleeting moment, you are in perfect sync with your gifts.

The editor offers a truthful reply, which might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\n\nThis spell doesn’t consider circumstances that might change the outcome, such as losing or discovering a fellow survivor.\n\n**Everything clicks (Enchanters only):** that glorious moment where everything just falls into place, that flow state you constantly chase after.

Perhaps you were one of those rare Super- Humans resulting from a “lucky accident,” simply in the right place at the wrong time, triggering what has been referred to as the Ultra-Gene.\n\nBefore Z-Day, all you had to worry about were “super-villains” or ‘Gene purists”. However, with Z-Day has come a disturbing phenomenon: some Super-Humans who possessed the Ultra gene do not simply become zombies, but twisted malign versions of themselves, with all ability to tell right from wrong erased from their psyche.\n\n**Ability Bonus:** Super-Humans are heartier than normal humans. You gain +2 to your Constitution score.\n\n**Origin Foundation Feature:**\n\n*Raw Potential:* When the moment calls for it, something inside you rises to meet the challenge, an instinctual burst of potential that pushes past your limits.\n\nOnce per Issue, when you roll for a power check, you may declare you’re pushing your limits.\n\n-   Temporarily increase that power’s Power Score by +4 for that roll only.\n-   If the power has a Burnout cost, it increases by +2 when using this boost.\n\n    This reflects your untapped potential or biological capacity kicking in, not learned technique, but raw Ultra-genetic output.\n\n    **Origin Foundation Limitation:**\n\n    *Power Limits*: Super-Humans are born with specific Ultra genes, which dictate the powers they can develop. You can only gain new inborn powers through mastering emulated powers.\n\n    Later, with the Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may have your Hero acquire new powers, but they must be made available through technology, supernatural, or some story-based event.\n\n    **  \n    **\n\n**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below.

You may take this feature again when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category, reducing the time between uses to a Hiatus.\n\n## Supernatural\n\nYou are possibly the strangest form of costumed hero—a supernatural being. You may be the ghost of someone slain before Z-Day (or *after*), the physical manifestation of some aspect of the natural world, a heroic vampire who fights the urge to drink the blood of the living, or someone infected with lycanthropy, assuming the form of a bear, tiger, wolf or other beast at will.\n\nBefore Z-Day, you almost certainly operated from the shadows, fighting criminals and other menaces without drawing too much attention to yourself. If you belonged to a super team, you avoided the spotlight and tended to be somewhat cryptic about your origins and nature. Now, *after* Z-Day, you are conflicted. You can certainly use your powers to help the scattered enclaves and survivors, but will they accept your help? Or will they look at you as just another zombie?\n\n**Ability Bonus:**\n\nSupernatural heroes are rather varied in origin and nature. You gain a +1 bonus to two ability scores of your choice.\n\n**Origin Foundation Features:**\n\n*More Than Human: Your body is no longer mortal.

You can not utilize this feature against damage delt by your supernatural vulnerability (see below).\n\n**Origin Foundation:**\n\n*Marked by the Supernatural: You are visibly or spiritually unnatural, a walking legend, myth, or monstrosity.*\n\n-   You must take **Strange Appearance** as a Weakness. You do not gain any bonus for taking this Weakness.\n-   You must also take a Vulnerability Weakness worth at least 10 points, representing your supernatural Achilles’ heel (e.g., silver, sunlight, fire, holy ground). You gain no bonuses for this Weakness either. If you possess the regeneration power, it does not heal damage delt by your Vulnerability.\n\n    These do not count toward your Weakness-based rewards but may still be activated by the Editor-in-Chief for Plot Points as normal\n\n**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx) at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.\n\n| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Bloodline Legacy                  |\n| Eldritch Sense                    |\n| Occultist                         |\n| Paranormal Ascendance             |\n| Paranormal Prowess                |\n| Resilient Bloodline               |\n| Unnatural Speed                   |\n| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |\n| Eldritch Mastery                  |\n| Psychic Shield                    |\n| Supernatural Fury                 |\n\n#### B-Lister Level Origin Features\n\n**Bloodline Legacy:** the mystic power that flows though you seems to get stronger with age, Increase any two ability scores of your choice by 1. you may take this feature multiple times.\n\n**Eldritch Sense:** Your connection to the flow grants you heightened senses and the ability to detect hidden threats or sources of power. You can sense the use of magic and supernatural based powers or events within a number of miles equal to your Charisma bonus. You can gauge the general power level classification of the magical event with a successful Charisma Check vs a DC: 20, -5 for each power level classification above Gamma, so gauging a Theta level event would require a DC 5 Charisma Check.\n\n**Occultist:** You have delved into the occult, and few can match your knowledge of it.

You may take this feature again when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category, reducing the time between uses to a Hiatus.\n\n## Techno Hero\n\nBack during the “Glory Days” you did well for yourself, using either your superior intellect or impressive resources to create your heroic persona. You might have a suit of power armor once designed for military applications, maybe you made a new scientific breakthrough, or you might just be an exceptional archer with a quiver of specialized arrows and the ability to scavenge like no other.\n\nBack when you had a workshop you were always able to keep your gear in tip top shape, but after everything fell apart you were lucky to have power, let alone a high-powered plasma cutter. Now you simply make do, find what you can, make it work, and move on. What other choice do you have?\n\n**Ability Bonus:**\n\nTech Heroes are generally geniuses; you gain +2 to your Intelligence score.\n\n**Origin Foundation Feature:**\n\n*  \nVisionary Engineer:* You possess an unparalleled mind for technology.\n\n-   One of your starting Skill Sets must be Visionary Engineer or a similarly themed Skill Set.\n-   Between issues, during your Enclave Interlude, you can repair or replace any one of your lost or broken items that possessed powers through the removable item flaw. Alternately, at the editor-in-chief’s discretion, you may repair or replace a technological item possessed by an ally.\n\n*Always one step ahead:   \n*Once per Issue, when one of your items is lost or destroyed, you may declare that you had a backup device or upgrade prepared in advance. As a Demanding Action, you can quickly assemble or activate this backup to replace the lost item. However, the device is flawed due to rushed deployment:\n\n-   Any powers granted by the replacement item are treated as if they have a Power Score of -2.\n-   All such powers suffer +2 additional Burnout when used.\n-   The backup item remains operational until the end of the Issue, after which it becomes unstable, unusable, or must be rebuilt during your next Enclave Interlude.\n\n**Origin Foundation Limitation:**\n\n*Only Human:* You are ultimately only human; you may never increase your base physical ability scores (before the application of powers such as Enhanced Ability scores) beyond 20.\n\n*Self-Made Hero:* All your powers must be derived from technology.

Increase your wisdom or intelligence score by +2 or both by +1; you may choose this option multiple times.\n\n**Always Learning:** You may define one Edge for each Skill Set you possess.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief must approve each Edge and should reflect a unique application of that Skill Set (e.g., “*I just understand weapon systems*” or “*master of field repair*”).\n\n**Analytical Mind:** Your engineering precision borders on the superhuman.\n\nChoose a Skill from a Skill Set you possess that relates to technology, diagnostics, invention, or analysis (e.g., “Jury Rigging” in Engineer, or “Reverse Engineering” in Arcane Engineer).\n\nYou may define a unique Edge related to that Skill, such as:\n\n*“Always knows what’s wrong with a machine.”*\n\n*“Can analyze any system in seconds.”*\n\n*“Never makes the same mistake twice.”*\n\nOnce per Issue, when using this Edge, you may roll with advantage.\n\n**Hardened Energy Source:**  Increase the burnout threshold any of your external power sources by 2\n\n**Just a few Adjustments:** Increase the power score of any of your pieces of technology by +2\n\n**Hacking Savant:** You don’t just crack systems, you dominate them.\n\n-   You may define an Edge tied specifically to digital intrusion, remote access, or system overrides.\n-   Once per Issue, when using this Edge to infiltrate a system, override technology, or exploit digital security, you may ignore one obstacle, security layer, or penalty the Editor-in-Chief would normally impose (e.g., \"You bypass the biometric lock without needing the admin hand\").\n\n    **Technological Mastery:** You have proficiency with technological devices and can attempt to interface with them even if you lack the necessary credentials or access codes. You gain a +5 bonus to all Intelligence checks related to analyzing or understanding technology.\n\n#### A-Lister Level Origin Features\n\n*Technological Precision:* You understand how machines think, and more importantly, how they break.\n\nOnce per scene, you may attempt an Intelligence-based Skill Set Challenge to identify weaknesses in a mechanical or technological enemy (such as a robot, construct, or powered armor suit).

Just pick the best fit and move on from there.\n\nWhen you choose an Archetype, you gain a bonus to a particular attribute and a list of Typical Powers*.*\n\n**Typical Powers** list of suggested powers for your Archetype. These are merely suggestions that fit your chosen Archetype.\n\nAll powers marked with a \\* may be acquired as a skill-based power, utilizing the All-Skill power modification (see pg. XX).\n\n\\<side bar\\>  \n*Character creation ride-along: Archetypes*   \nRuben continues with his concept. Ruben goes with the Controller, and Nani goes with the brawler.\n\nRuben notes that the controller grants him either a +1 bonus to Wisdom or Charisma. He chooses charisma and selects Honeyed Tongue as his bonus feat.\n\nNani chooses to build a Heavy, which grants him either a +1 Strength or Charisma. Nani goes with +1 to strength, then chooses Weapon Master as her bonus feat\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n## \\<H2\\>Blaster\n\nYou excel at blasting people from a distance, but that’s not to say that you are helpless when cornered in melee! You prefer to use your powers to punish at a distance… a handy attribute when being faced down by a pack of zombies or fighting super zombies without range powers.\n\n**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Dexterity or Charisma\n\n**Marksman:** You gain *Hawkeye* as a free feat\n\n**Blaster Typical Powers:** Adsorb Energy, Damaging Form, Energy Blast, Energy Explosion, Energy Generation, Energy Manipulation, Energy Sheath, Enhanced Ability Score (Dexterity)\\*, Flight, Force Field, Force Shield, Psychic Attack.\n\n**\\<Sidebar\\>**\n\n### \\<h3\\> Legacy Archetype: The Andromorph\n\nIn the first edition of Rotted Capes, Andromorphs were introduced as their own Archetype, beings of fluid identity and form, able to shift gender, appearance, and sometimes even biology at will. But in Rotted Capes 2nd Edition, this concept has been reimagined.\n\nRather than being a single rigid Archetype or Origin, Andromorph works better as a narrative overlay, a form, not a source of power. An Andromorph could just as easily be a shape-changing mystic, a gene-hacked Super-Human, or a disguised android. What matters isn’t how they shift, but that they do.\n\n**Gameplay Note:**  \nIf you want to play an Andromorph, work with your Editor-in-Chief to flavor your Origin, Powers, or Feats accordingly. Shapechange, Power Emulation, and Dynamic Form are all excellent ways to model this concept mechanically.\n\n\\</Sidebar\\>\n\n## \\<H2\\>Brawler\n\nYou like to get into the thick of it! While some people used to call you reckless, its nothing compared to the levels of recklessness you have displayed after Z-Day. You get in the midst of the action, right there between the chattering teeth and ripping claws… right where you like it.\n\n**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution\n\n**Scrapper:** You gain your choice between the martial arts feat and the weapon master feat.\n\n**Typical Powers:** Armor, Bestial Transformation, Endurance\\*, Enhanced Attack\\*, Enhanced Ability Score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) \\*, Enhanced Senses, Force Field. Personal, Invulnerability, Regeneration, Resistance, Super-Sense.\n\n## \\<H2\\>Controller\n\nYou may be a telepath or telekinetic or might even know how to control the weather. Put simply, you have the ability to control something or someone... As a telepath, you have survived by wit and guile by “convincing” others to fight for you, or finding an enclave to take you in. As a kinetic of any kind, you have just learned to crush or throw Zombies out of your way.\n\n**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Wisdom or Charisma\n\n**Manipulator:** You gain either the Empathic Intuition or Honeyed Tongue as a bonus feat.\n\n**Typical Powers:** Animate Object, Botanokinesis, Control Weather, Darkness, Gravity Control, Emotion Control, Entangle, Mind Control, Move Object, Nullify, invulnerability (psychic), Power Boost, Sixth Sense\\*, Sympathy, Telepathy, Weaken.\n\n## \\<H2\\>Infiltrator\n\nMost people refer to your type as ‘ghosts’; always slipping in, out, or through and always one step ahead of trouble. Perhaps you can walk through walls or disappear; these are very handy abilities, especially after Z-Day.\n\n**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Dexterity or Intelligence\n\n**Ghost: You** gain the Stealthy feat for free\n\n**Typical Powers:** Adoptive Muscle Memory\\*, Catfall\\*, Darkness, Eidetic Memory, Endurance\\*, Enhanced Sense\\*, Illusion, Incorporeal, Invisibility, Luck\\*, Manifest Gear\\*, Surge\\*, Swinging, Wall Crawl\\*, Wireless.\n\n## \\<H2\\>Heavy\n\n*Some people refer to heaves as “shakers” because when they throw down, people feel it blocks away.*\n\nOn the surface, you have a lot in common with brawlers, but it’s the way you bring down your foes that makes you different. Your skin is tougher, you’re stronger, and bigger… much bigger. You’re the guy people hide behind. You are a wall, turning to face an oncoming horde.\n\n**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Strength or Constitution\n\n**Heavy Duty:** You gain either Toughness or Large as a bonus feat.\n\n**Typical Powers:**  Adsorb Matter, Armor, Bestial Transformation, Density Control, Endurance\\*, Enhanced Attack\\*, Enhanced Ability Score (Strength or Constitution)\\*, Enhanced Senses, Force Field. Personal, Growth, Invulnerability, Regeneration, Resistance, Super-Sense.\n\n## \\<H2\\>Transporter\n\nYou possess the ability to move from place to place with ease. Perhaps you’re a flyer or a speedster, or the rarest of Transporters: a Teleporter.\n\nYou have done well, keeping one step ahead of the Z’d Supers; most can’t even touch you. Perhaps to those you help protect, you have become the best bait, always drawing the zombies where they are most effectively dealt with. Or maybe you are a blur of motion, taking down zombies in the midst of a fight where you do the most good.\n\n**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Dexterity or Wisdom\n\n**In and Out:** You gain either the Quick or Increased Burnout feat for free.\n\n**Typical Powers:** Celerity\\*, Enhanced Ability Score (Dexterity, Wisdom, Constitution), Flight, Geospatial Shift,\n\nInvisibility, Portal, Speed\\*, Surge\\*, Teleport, Temporal Fugue, Tunnel, Wall Crawl.\n\n# Step 3: Determine Ability Scores\n\nAbility scores measure your hero’s physical and mental characteristics, such as how smart, quick, or witty they are. There are 6 Ability Scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. A hero’s defenses; vitality, wounds, pace, and number of starting skills all rely on these ability scores. These scores are your baseline scores before the application of any powers, if any.\n\nWhere the common bystander generally possesses scores of 8 to 10 in most attributes, a B-Lister’s attributes can range anywhere from 8 to 18. Some heroes are exceptionally powerful in a single attribute, which is augmented through powers; even these B-Listers' highest score generally stays in the low 20s.

Arrange the following scores 16,15,14,13,12,11 among your abilities any way you wish.\n2.  Add any ability score bonuses from your Origin and Archetype.\n\n**Customized starting ability scores.**\n\n1.  You start with 36 points; spend these points to determine your ability scores using the table below.\n2.  Add any ability score bonuses from your Origin and Archetype.\n\n| Starting Ability Score Cost Table |      |\n|-----------------------------------|------|\n| Ability Scores                    | Cost |\n| 8                                 | 0    |\n| 9                                 | 1    |\n| 10                                | 2    |\n| 11                                | 3    |\n| 12                                | 4    |\n| 13                                | 5    |\n| 14                                | 6    |\n| 15                                | 8    |\n| 16                                | 10   |\n| 17                                | 12   |\n\n# Step 4: Starting Powers\n\n*Powers are the extraordinary abilities that set us apart from the regular folk, before all we had to worry about was those powers in the wrong hands, and we had our hands full with them. Now we have Super Z’s to worry about. But it’s not them that I worry the most about, they are so territorial you can keep clear of them if ya need too. I worry about those who use their powers raid enclaves for their resources while put regular folk under heal in exchange for their “protection”*\n\nDuring this step, you’ll define what makes your hero superhuman. Here you’ll choose your powers, set their scores, and shape them with modifications that fine-tune their risks and rewards.\n\n## Power Scores and Modifications\n\nPowers use scores, just like abilities. They typically start between 10 and 16, depending on how you build your hero. You can improve these scores through power modifications, which customize how your powers work, sometimes adding limitations, sometimes unlocking potent new tricks. Modifications are the trade-offs and quirks that make your hero’s powers unique.\n\n## Determining Your Starting Powers\n\nYou have three ways to build your starting powers. Each is designed to give you the flexibility to match your concept, whether you’re channeling a classic archetype, a precise power fantasy, or something unconventional.\n\n### Option 1: Power Sets\n\nThe easiest way to start is by choosing a Power Set. Power Sets are thematic bundles of powers that fit your chosen archetype. Power Sets offer a quick, narrative-driven approach to getting started. After you pick your Power Set, you can apply power modifications to tweak it to your liking.\n\n### Option 2: Power Score Arrays\n\nIf you’d rather mix and match your powers, you can select a Power Score Array that matches the number of powers you want to take. Once you’ve chosen the number of powers you want, you pick your powers and assign each power a score from the array. Then, as with Power Sets, apply modifications to make each power your own.\n\n### Option 3: Point Buy\n\nFor maximum control, you can spend a pool of points to buy power at whatever scores you choose (within limits). This option is the most flexible, letting you craft a hero with one or two standout powers or a wide range of more balanced abilities. Just remember: the more you spread yourself too thin, the less power you can shine. Modifications come last, letting you customize your choices.\n\n\\<side bar\\>  \n*Character creation ride-along: Step 5: Starting Powers*   \nRuben chooses to go with the point buy option, picking the powers of personal force field, move object, and Energy Blast, with Kinetic as his damage type. He has 32 points to buy power scores and ends up with a personal force field: 16, move object: 16, and Energy Blast (Kinetic): 17. He chooses to have all the powers linked, boosting them to 18, 18, and 19, respectively.\n\nNani wants to hit things. She chooses to go with the power score array option, choosing the powers of Armor, Enhanced Ability (Choosing Strength), Energy Blast (Electrical Damage), Invulnerability (Electricity Damage), and chooses a sword as her mystical item, giving it Enhanced Attack (Electrical damage). She sees the array for 5 powers, giving her scores of 16, 15, 14, 12, and 12, allowing her to arrange them as she wants.\n\nSo Nani applies her scores, ending up with Armor: 16, Enhanced Ability (Strength): 15, Energy Blast (Electrical):14, Invulnerability (electricity):12, and Enhanced Attack (Electrical):12  \n  \nShe chooses the *Underpowered Form* flaw requiring her to call upon the power of her father and the sword he gifted her to take her true form, giving her a +2 to all her powers, she also *Links* her armor and enhanced ability powers granting them an additional +2 to those powers, finally she applies the *Removable Item* flaw to her sword raising her Enhanced Attack power by +2 as well.\n\nFinalizing her power scores to Armor: 20, Enhanced Ability (Strength): 19, Energy Blast (Electrical):16, Invulnerability (electricity):14, and her sword now possesses Enhanced Attack (Electrical):16\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n**Option 1: Choose a Power Set**\n\n1.  Choose a power set: Power sets are collections of similar powers that fall within a particular theme; if you choose a power set, you must choose a power set in accordance with your archetype. Once you choose your power set, you may rearrange the power scores as you wish among the set’s powers. While power sets limit your choices, they do have slightly higher scores than those provided by other options.\n2.  Apply any power flaws/perks to your powers which may increase or decrease the final score\n    1.  You may apply any number of power modifications to a power. Still, if a power’s final score, after modifications, exceeds your rank cap (24 during hero creation), it is capped at this maximum. Any points above the cap are considered untapped potential. You can utilize the power’s score up to the new rank cap as you increase in rank.\n    2.  You may not use perks to reduce a power’s final score below 10.\n\n## Blaster Power Set\n\nEnergy Blast: 16\n\nEnergy Generation: 12\n\nEnergy Explosion: 14\n\nEnergy Sheath: 16\n\nFlight: 12\n\n## Brawler Power Set\n\nEnhanced Attack\\*: 16\n\nEnhanced Ability Score (Strength or Dexterity)\\*: 16\n\nEnhanced Ability Score (Constitution)\\*: 12\n\nRegeneration: 14\n\nSuper-Sense: 12\n\n## Controller Power Set\n\nTelepathy: 12\n\nEmotion Control: 12\n\nMind Control: 16\n\nMove Object: 16\n\nSympathy: 14\n\n## Infiltrator Power Set\n\nAdoptive Muscle Memory\\*: 16\n\nEnhanced Sense\\*: 14\n\nInvisibility: 16\n\nLuck\\*: 12\n\nSwinging: 12\n\n## Heavy Power Set\n\nArmor: 16\n\nEnhanced Attack\\*: 12\n\nEnhanced Ability Score (Strength)\\*: 14\n\nEnhanced Ability Score (Constitution)\\*: 16\n\nResistance: 12\n\n## Transporter Power Set\n\nCelerity\\*: 16\n\nEnhanced Ability Score (Dexterity): 14\n\nSpeed\\*: 16\n\nSurge: 14\n\nTemporal Fugue: 12\n\n**Option 2: B-Lister Power Score Array**\n\n3.

Apply any power flaws/perks to your powers which may increase or decrease the final score\n    1.  You may apply any number of power modifications to a power, but if a power’s final score, after modifications, exceeds your power score cap (23 during hero creation), it is capped at this maximum.

Maybe your hero is violently allergic to rare metal, maybe you are particularly vulnerable to sonic attacks or find all their powers nullified around strong electrical fields.\n\nYou are *not* required to choose a weakness. You may choose to skip this step.\n\nWhile some weaknesses are limited to a specific origin, they be applied to another origin with your Editor-in-Chief’s approval.\n\nWhen you choose a weakness, you gain a number of points; depending on the number of points, you may choose from ability score bonuses, power score bonuses, or bonus feats. You may only acquire a maximum of 20 points through weaknesses; you can always choose more weaknesses at no mechanical benefit. You may spend these points to gain the following benefits: you may spend your points on the options below in any way you wish.\n\n| **Weakness Point Options**  |                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Points**                  | **Possible Benefits**                                                                                     |\n| **5**                       | +1 to any ability score or power score.                                                                   |\n| **10**                      | Gain a feat                                                                                               |\n| **15**                      | Gain a feat and a +1 to any ability score or power score *or* +2 to any 2 ability scores or power scores. |\n\n**\\<side bar\\>**\n\nEditor’s Note:\n\n**The non-weakness:** Both the players and the Editor-in-Chief should work together to develop a hero’s weakness. The Editor-in-Chief should be alert for “non-weaknesses,” where players attempt to minimize the impact of a weakness while gaining maximum benefits.\n\nFor example, if you are running a campaign in sunny Miami, a hero with weakness against extreme cold weather conditions may be attempting to “game” the system.\n\n**\\<side bar\\>**\n\n\\<side bar\\>  \n*Character creation ride-along: Weaknesses.*   \nAlthough they don’t have to, both players take on a weakness.\n\nRuben has chosen to give his hero a physical vulnerability: something about his telekinetic powers seems to be affected by gravity powers. He chooses a Stimuli: Gravity Powers and the effect of Power Negation of all his powers. Gravity Powers are rare, so they are worth 0 points, but power negation is worth 10 points and use it to gain an additional bonus feat, choosing the feat *Quick*.\n\nNani decides to give their hero a dependent: her little sister. She is only 8, so although she is in good health, she is not yet fully capable. Nani gains 10 points and also gets a feat, gets *improved ability score* and uses it to gain +1 to her Enhanced Strength power, raising it to 20, and +1 to her constitution score, raising it to 16.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n## Addiction\n\n*You need it. You want it. You gotta have it.*\n\n*There is something out there you desperately crave. During the Glory Days, it was easy to get enough of it to keep you going. But now, after Z-Day, supplies are scarce, and getting your fix is becoming harder and harder. How far will you go before you crash?*\n\n**Effect:** To build an Addiction, select a substance your hero is addicted to. You may be addicted to more than one substance. If you are, purchase the substance that gives the highest possible bonus first, then add a +1 build point for each additional addictive substance. Characters must partake of their addictive substance at least once per day. If they fail to partake, they suffer disadvantage on all skill and power checks until they partake again. While characters are assumed to start playing with a stockpile of whatever substance they’re addicted to, the Editor-in-Chief can always declare that this stockpile is depleted, ruined, or missing; at this point, you will need to seek a new supply.\n\n**Substance:**\n\n-   **Common:** Substances could include sugar and/or sugary foods (such as candy), cigarettes, or coffee. **  \n    You gain 5 points.**\n-   **Uncommon:** Substances could include certain mild drugs (such as marijuana or commercial painkillers), vaping (electronic cigarettes), alcohol, or inhaling certain chemical fumes. **You gain 10 points.**\n-   **Rare:** Substances could include hard drugs (cocaine, meth, PCP, and the like), commercially available amphetamines, or medical painkillers (such as Oxycodone and the like). **You gain 15 points.**\n\n## Dark Secret\n\n*There is something about you you’d prefer to keep hidden.*\n\n**Effect:** There is something in your past that you’d like to keep hidden. Having the secret exposed could damage your standing and/or reputation among their teammates or bystanders, resulting in you longer being taken seriously, having privileges or supplies taken away, putting you under suspicion of any recent crimes, or in a worst-case scenario, they could have you expelled from their current enclave.\n\n-   Your secret is something trivial and more potentially embarrassing than damaging. For example, maybe you were a boyband pop star, participated in a low-brow reality show, was a cringeworthy YouTuber, or had a popular We Fan page. **You gain 5 points.**\n-   Maybe you made a few deals with supervillains, or you are a former criminal (whose crimes go beyond petty theft and the like). Or, they may claim experience you don’t have (such as claiming to be a doctor, having military experience, or being a police officer). **You gain 10 points.**\n-   You may have resorted to cannibalism to survive the initial aftermath of Z-Day, maybe you’re a registered sex offender, or you may have committed one or more murders (either before or after Z-Day). Or, they may claim to be someone they’re not — a former US Senator, a high-ranking member of the Federal government, or they’ve taken the identity of a different B-Lister (who may or may not still be alive). **You gain 15 points.**\n\n## Dependence\n\n*Your metabolism or physiology is such that you require frequent exposure to a particular condition (such as sunlight or immersion in water), or you must partake of a specific substance (such as an experimental medicine), or your equipment might require frequent repair or refueling.*\n\n**Effect:** To build a Dependency, apply each step and add up the points acquired. You shouldn’t have more than one Dependency. You must satisfy their dependence at least once per day; if you fail to do so, they’ll suffer a negative effect. In addition, the time it takes to satisfy the dependence can be a factor. Simply popping a pill offers fewer points than needing to spend hours soaking in a tub of water.\n\n**Substance:**\n\n-   **Common:** Substances could include immersion in water, exposure to sunlight, or a commonly available alcohol-based fuel. **You gain 0 points.**\n-   **Uncommon:** Substances could include needing to ‘bathe’ in a large bonfire, extensive repairs requiring easily scavenged parts, a custom fuel that takes time to distill, or an easily synthesized drug. **You gain 5 points.**\n-   **Rare:** Substances could include extensive repairs requiring hard-to-find parts, exposure to a specific form of radiation, or a drug custom-made to keep you alive. **You gain 10 points.**\n\n**Negative Effects:**\n\n-   **Power Negation:** All your powers stop working until you can partake in your dependency. **You gain 5 points.**\n-   **Physical Weakness:** You suffer a disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, Constitution checks and skill checks until you can partake in your dependency. **You gain 5 points.**\n-   **Incapacitating Weakness:** If you fail to meet your Dependency requirement, your maximum Stamina is reduced by 2d12 every hour until you reach 0 Stamina and fall unconscious or until you partake in your dependency. If you reach 0 stamina, you remain unconscious until you partake in your dependency. You recover your lost Stamina after completing a Hiatus. **You gain 10 points.**\n-   **Fatal Weakness:** If you fail to meet your Dependence requirement, you lose 1 wound every hour until you reach 0 wounds or until you partake of your dependency. If you reach 0 wounds you die unless you can partake of your dependency within 1 minute after reaching 0 wounds. You recover wounds lost from suffering this weakness after completing a Hiatus. **You gain 15 points.**\n\n## Dependent\n\nThere is someone you care about who depends on you for survival.\n\n**Effect:** Simply put, there is someone close to you who depends on you for survival. This goes above and beyond a Supporting Cast member into something far more personal. Your dependent can be a younger sibling, a daughter or son, an elderly relative, and so on.\n\n-   Your Dependent can be a person of *average* health and ability, they are a survivor of the apocalypse and know how to get by. **You gain 5 points.**\n-   Your Dependent is weaker than the *common* survivor. While their mind may still be sharp, their body is aged, injured, or ravaged by illness. Although they are able to still walk, they do so slowly and have difficulty with stairs and the like. **You gain 10 points.**\n-   Your Dependent is of *frail* health. They may be blind, deaf, partially paralyzed, and so on. They depend on you for most of their needs, and would probably quickly succumb to the dangerous of the post-apocalyptic world if left alone. **You gain 15 points.**\n\n### Sample Dependents\n\nThere are sample dependents in chapter XXX of this book, alternately you may choose to build a dependent using the following options.\n\n|             | **Abilities (Points - Array)**  | **Skills Points** |\n|-------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Average** | (25) 12, 11, 10, 10, 10, 9      | 15                |\n| **Weak**    | (20) 12, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8         | 10                |\n| **Frail**   | (15) 12, 10, 9, 8, 8, 8         | 5                 |\n\n**Weak Dependents** possess the Mentally Frail or Physically Frail weakness (see below).\n\n**Frail Dependents** possess the Mentally Frail or Physically Frail weakness as well as either a Severe Mental Flaw or Severe Physical Flaw (see below).\n\n### Dependent Archetypes:\n\nThe following examples should give you an idea of the kind of Dependents your Hero can have.\n\n-   **The Younger Sibling:** The younger sibling usually idolizes you and wants to be just like you when they grow up. They may wear a variant of your costume, practice their combat skills, and cobble together sufficient gear in an effort to emulate your super powers. They may try to be your sidekick, joining you on excursions, or they may try to go out on their own. In any event, odds are that sooner or later they will get in over their head, forcing you to try and rescue them.\n-   **The Child:** The child is similar to the sibling; in that they usually look up to you and may also want to be ‘just like you’ when they get older. However, the child is often far younger than the sibling, and is less capable of taking care of themselves. In addition, you need to see to the child’s instruction and training, especially in the use of weapons and survival skills. Your enemies may see your child as a vulnerability they can exploit, someone they can kidnap and use to force you to do their bidding.\n-   **The Spouse/Lover:** Unlike many who survived the onset of Z-Day, you were able to protect your spouse (or lover) from the zombie hordes. This may result in you being overly protective of them, and working overtime to ensure their safety. They may worry about you as well, and may try to talk you into engaging in less risky behavior and try to encourage you to remain within the relative safety of the enclave. If you’re away too often, your spouse or lover may find solace in the company of another, a situation which will probably not end well for anyone.\n-   **The Elderly Relative:** Be it your father, grandmother, or aged aunt, you seek to protect and keep safe one of the last remaining members of your immediate family. The Elderly Relative is often either frail or handicapped and may be bed-ridden or require special medical needs. As much as you hate to admit it, they are often a drain on the enclave’s resources without giving much back in return. And if you ever need to abandon the enclave quickly, their physical health may not take the strain.\n-   **The Mentor/Father Figure:** Unlike the younger sibling who looks up to you, this is someone you look up to. This person might be a former superhero who taught you the ropes, but whose health has declined with old age. Or a replacement for the mother or father you never knew, who brought you up when no one else cared. Or your boss from before Z-Day, who helped you succeed. In any event, this person’s wisdom and wise council is such that you wish to preserve it despite all the post-apocalyptic world throws at you.\n-   **The Beloved Pet:** When you’ve lost everything, then you might seek solace in an animal companion. Your dog (or cat, or monkey, or…) may be the last thing left from your previous life, or it might be an animal you adopted while wandering the apocalyptic wasteland. In any event, your pet means as much to you as a child or sibling might mean to another Hero. Better keep a close eye on it, lest some other survivor gets hungry and decides to eat it.\n\n**What happens if the Dependent dies?   \n**Considering the nature of the world post Z-Day, your Hero will need to consider the possibility of their Dependent’s death. What then? First, unlike the Glory Days, you have almost no chance of getting a new Dependent. Or, one with as deep an emotional bond as the one you lost. To represent the physiological trauma of losing your Dependent in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested world your Hero will need to replace their Dependent Disadvantage with another weakness fitting the situation.\n\n-   **Enemy:** Mad with grief and anger, you must now seek out whoever (or whatever) killed your Dependent to the exclusion of all else. This enemy is well aware of your disposition toward them and returns your intent in kind.\n-   **Mental Disorder: Death wish:** You have nothing left to live for. You no longer care about your own safety or survival, and will take on more and more risky missions and actions, all in an effort to join your Dependent in death. You may not even care about others anymore, as it is obvious that no matter what you do, everyone around you is going to die.\n-   **Dark Secret:** Maybe it was your direct actions that led to your dependent’s death. The knowledge of which would shake your enclave to its core.\n\n## Enemy\n\n*Someone out there doesn’t like you.*\n\n*Before Z-Day almost every superhero had a rogues’ gallery of foes. After Z-Day most of these rogues either died, were Z’d, or joined the assorted B-Listers in defending the rest of humanity. For you, their place has been taken by someone new. This someone may be an individual (such as a supervillain with an extreme grudge) or a group (such as a horde of religious fanatics who wish to burn you and your enclave for spurning them). In any event, you need to be careful anytime you venture outside the enclave, as you never know where your enemy may be waiting.*\n\n**Effect:** Your enemy always seems to find a way to complicate your life and the lives of those around you. The Editor-in-Chief may have your enemy show up at any time. Even if you take countermeasures to create some distance between you and your enemy, it is only a matter of time before they show up again. **You gain 5 points, with Tyrant being worth 10.**\n\n\\<side bar\\>**  \n**Editor’s Note:   \n**There are always bigger fish:** If the heroes somehow defeat the hero’s Enemy, it’s not the end of the story, if anything the defeat of an enemy should open the door to a new threat.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### Sample Enemies\n\nThe following examples should give you an idea of the kind of Enemies your Hero can have. Make sure to discuss your idea with the Editor-in-Chief, first to see if your idea fits the campaign, and second to see what changes the Editor-in- Chief wants to make to your Enemy (not all of which you may know about!).\n\n**Biker Gang:** Post Z-Day most biker gangs stay on the move, looting first one area then another. In this case, you have something the bikers want. Perhaps there’s a former motorcycle dealership in your enclave, full of parts they need. Or you have a working fuel refinery and all the gas the bikers will ever need. Or you have the only decent food stores for miles around. In any case, the bikers want into your enclave and will do anything to gain entry. While you might be safe behind your walls, sooner or later you’ll need to go out into the ruins to scavenge for supplies and the bikers will be waiting. Worst yet, there may come a time when the bikers become desperate enough to launch an all-out assault on your enclave. Will you and your fellow B-Listers be able to stop them?\n\n**Cannibals:** Similar to the biker gang (and as an added bonus you can make them a cannibal biker gang), this is a group of people that eats other people. The exact reasons vary: they may be religious fanatics (see Cultists below) seeking to emulate zombies by devouring the living; they may use it as an initiation ritual, forcing others to partake of human flesh in order to ‘mark’ them; or, they may simply feel that it’s easier to catch and devour others than bother trying to raise chickens and pigs. In any case, they wish to devour you and your companions. Probably because they have a misguided idea that eating the body of a superhuman will give them superhuman powers, try not to get caught.\n\n**Cultists:** Cultists are religious fanatics whose faith is dark and twisted. They seek to impose their will, and their religious ways, on everyone around them. Infidels, which in their case is anyone who doesn’t believe *exactly* as they do, are to be purged, often with fire. Cultists may despise zombies, or they may worship them (leading to cannibal cultists), but in any event, they have no use for your enclave (aside from the resources it offers). If you do not convert to their ways by choice, then they will convert you by force. Similar in some respects to a biker gang, the cultists are less like to lay in wait and will probably attack openly. Unfortunately, their fanaticism makes them highly unlikely to break and run.\n\n**Tyrant:** This is an enclave, or series of enclaves, dedicated to one thing and one thing only, their leader. Everything anyone does, they do for the ‘state’, and no one is allowed to dissent. Free and independent enclaves, such as yours, are an anathema to them and must be brought to heel. The tyrant and their followers are probably the most dangerous form of Enemy a Hero can have as they are often well-organized, well-equipped, and well-trained. They are also implacable. Since the leader can’t appear weak, the tyrant’s followers will almost never give up the attack and will come at you and your enclave again and again. They may also use sophisticated tactics, weaponry, and individuals, including B-Listers of their own. Fortunately for you, these fanatics are usually led by a single strong man, and if you can take him out, much of the power goes with him. As the tyrant tends to be paranoid and power-hungry, they usually haven’t made provisions for when they’re no longer around. Remove the tyrant, and infighting among the lieutenants usually takes care of the rest.\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\nFor an excellent example of a cannibalistic gang of cultists, read *Lucifer’s Hammer* by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n## Mental Condition\n\nYour mind isn’t as resilient as others’, whether due to phobias, trauma, neurological divergence, or simple lack of mental acuity.\n\n**Effect:** To build a Mental Condition, pick an option at each step and add up the total points acquired. You may choose multiple negative effects to the same stimulus, gaining the highest possible bonus: **+5 points** for each additional negative effect.\n\n**Step 1: Choose the Type**\n\n-   **Cognitive Limitation**: ADHD, Dyslexia, or learning delays. You may struggle to focus or process complex tasks.\n-   **Emotional Instability:** mood swings, panic attacks, explosive anger, or inappropriate emotional reactions.\n-   **Disorder or Trauma:** PTSD, dissociative identity, obsessive compulsions, hallucinations.\n-   **Low Mental Resilience:** You’re unusually vulnerable to fear, horror, and psychotic breaks.\n\n**Step 2: Choose severity**\n\n-   **Slight:** Minor inconvenience or phobia. Disadvantage on 1 type of check under stress. **You gain 5 points.**\n-   **Challenging:** Disadvantage on all checks involving one mental stat (INT, WIS, or CHA) **or** Psychosis saves. **You gain 10 points.**\n-   **Sever:** Disadvantage on all saves vs. Psychosis and on all checks involving 2 mental stats. **You gain 15 points.**\n\n**Step 3: Triggering Complications**\n\n*Once per session, the Editor-in-Chief may trigger a severe manifestation (e.g., panic attack, hallucination, breakdown). This forces you to act irrationally or skip your next turn. Doing so earns a Plot Point (per the standard Flaw rules).*\n\n## Physical Condition\n\n*Whether due to age, injury, illness, or simple genetics, your body isn’t built for the rigors of heroism. You might have a limp, brittle bones, chronic fatigue, or be missing key body parts, but you're still standing. Mostly.*\n\n**Effect:** To build a Physical Condition, pick an option at each step and add up the total points acquired. You may choose multiple negative effects to the same stimulus, gaining the highest possible bonus: **+5 points** for each additional negative effect.\n\n**Step 1: Choose the Cause**\n\nYou may define your Physical Condition as:\n\n-   Injury (missing limb, chronic pain, neurological impairment)\n-   Frail Physiology (extremely young, old, or otherwise delicate)\n-   Degenerative Illness (muscular dystrophy, respiratory disorder)\n-   Impairment (blindness, deafness, mobility issues)\n-   Low Physical Aptitude (naturally weak, slow, or uncoordinated)\n\n**Step 2: Choose severity**\n\n-   **Slight:** Disadvantage on physical actions involving one body part or sense (e.g., one arm, one eye). **You gain 5 points.**\n-   **Challenging:** Disadvantage on all checks involving one physical ability score (STR, DEX, or CON). **You gain 10 points.**\n-   **Sever:** Disadvantage on all STR, DEX, and CON rolls and reduce max Stamina by 10. **You gain 15 points.**\n\n**Optional: Dependents’ Flaws**\n\n*If this condition applies to a Dependent instead of the hero, it also reduces their skill points and ability scores (see Dependent Creation).*\n\n## Physical Vulnerabilities\n\n*You possess a physical vulnerability against a particular material (such as lead) or condition (such as daylight or being exposed to gamma radiation).*\n\n*Both heroes and villains will do everything in their power to keep any vulnerability secret even from their closest friends and companions.*\n\n**Restriction:** cannot be taken by the highly trained or tech heroes.\n\n**Effect:** To build a Unique Vulnerability simply apply each step and add up total points acquired. You may choose multiple negative effects to the same stimuli, gaining the highest possible bonus; **+5 points** for each additional negative effect.\n\n**Part 1: Choose a Stimuli:**\n\n*Material Weakness:* If a particular type of material is chosen (such as lead), any time you start your turn within 2 areas of that substance, you suffer from this weakness's effect. At the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, a huge amount of the material in question may increase the weaknesses’ effective range.\n\n*Conditional Weakness:* Any time you are exposed to a particular environmental condition; they suffer from their vulnerabilities effects until they can get away from or are free of that condition.\n\n*Energy Weakness:* Choose a particular energy type; for example, Sonic, Cold, Heat, Gamma Radiation, and so on. You suffer the effects of this weakness if you are exposed to this energy type consciously for more than 1 turn or if you are the target of a power or attack that utilizes this energy type.\n\n**Part 2: Choose a Stimuli’s Rarity:**\n\n*Common items:* Stimuli may include plastic, glass, steel, daylight, storms, or being tied up with rope or chains. **You gain 10 points.**\n\n*Uncommon items:* Stimuli may include lead, mercury, gold, being exposed to extreme temperatures, open fire, being attacked by magic, or being knee deep in water. **You gain 5 points.**\n\n*Rare items:* Stimuli may include items such as a rare type of meteorite from a distant planet or being exposed to the radiation of a distant sun. **You gain 0 points.**\n\n**Part 3: Choose Negative Effect:**\n\n*Power Negation:* All of your inborn powers simply stop working until the end of your next turn if you start your turn within range of your chosen martial or under your chosen environmental condition. If you are the target of an attack which uses an energy type, you have a weakness toward your inborn powers cease to function until the end of your next turn. **You gain 5 points.**\n\n*Physical Weakness:*  Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores are reduced to 8 any time you start your turn within range of or being exposed to your chosen stimuli, or if you are the target of an attack or power which utilizes an energy type you are weak against. Your ability scores continue to remain diminished as long as you remain exposed to the stimuli. You regain your ability scores at the end of your next turn after no longer being exposed to your chosen stimuli. **You gain** **5 points.**\n\n*Physical Vulnerability:*  You possess physical vulnerability against an energy type or weapons made of a material you are weak against. These attacks bypass any damage reduction you might possess and deal double damage. **You gain** **10 points.**\n\n*Deadly weakness:* You possess vulnerability against damage dealt by energy types or weapons made of a material you are weak against. These attacks bypass any damage reduction you might possess. If you start your turn within range of a material or under a condition you are weak against, you instead suffer 4d6 damage, which bypasses any damage reduction you might possess. The Extra damage dealt by this disadvantage is applied when determining the possibility of massive damage. **You gain 10 points.**\n\n*Lethal weakness:* Any time you start your turn within range or of, or being exposed to, your weakness or if you are the target of an attack or power which utilizes an energy type you are weak against you gain a level of exhaustion*.* Once you leave the range of the substance you lose a level of exhaustion granted by this weakness at the rate of 1 level per minute. **You gain 15 points.**\n\n## Ravenous Metabolism\n\n*Your body requires much more food than a regular person.*\n\n**Restriction:** Super-Human, Cosmic, or Supernatural, or Alien or Andromorph Archetype\n\n**Effect:** During the Glory Days food was never really a problem for you; with drive through, vending machines, and the local supermarket, you were never more than an arm’s reach away from a power bar. But things have changed. You require double the food of a regular person, and must eat something every 6 hours in between regular meals, be it beef jerky, Twinkies, an apple, or what have you. Although you can attempt to keep yourself well-supplied with food stores, there will come times when the Editor-in-Chief simply informs you food supplies are running low, which may force you to undertake a scavenger run, seek out fruit trees, and so on. If you do not eat on regular bases (every 6 hours) your Burnout Threshold decreases by 5 for every meal you skip, to a minimum of 5. **You gain 5 points.**\n\n## Strange Appearance\n\n*You possess a strange or disturbing appearance which may entice or terrify others.*\n\n**Effect:** To build a Strange Appearance, choose its ease of concealment and your appearance’s effect on others then add up the points acquired. Bystanders or other heroes who do not know you on a personal basis may be quick to judge, flee from you, or in the case of someone with a threatening appearance, may attack you. Additionally, you suffer a penalty to all Influence skill rolls equal to the amount of points acquired through this disadvantage.\n\n*Ease of Concealment:* If your strange appearance is easily concealed, **you gain 0 points.** If your strange appearance is impossible to hide (such as fur or a demonic appearance), **you gain 5 points.**\n\n*Effect upon others:* If you possess a slightly disturbing or strangely attractive trait (such as red eyes or shining silver hair) **you gain 0 points**. If your appearance is disturbing or mildly threatening (small horns or giant bat wings) **you gain 5 points.** If your appearance is outright threatening (you possess the aforementioned demonic appearance), **you gain 10 points.**\n\n## Taboo\n\n*You are restricted from actions a normal person can perform.*\n\n**Effect:** The nature of your existence means there are certain things you simply cannot do. Perhaps your mystical powers require you to refrain from eating meat or bathing. Perhaps your android programming includes a failsafe against certain behavior. Perhaps your supernatural nature prevents you from entering a building without being invited. To build a Taboo apply each step and add up the points acquired. The Hero may choose multiple Taboos, gaining the highest possible bonus, **+5 points** for each additional restriction.\n\n**Part 1: Restriction**\n\n-   *Easy:* These restrictions either have few negative effects when followed or are rarely encountered. Examples include not interacting with a particular person, not bathing except in a natural lake or river, or not crossing a line of salt. **You gain 0 points.**\n-   *Moderate:* These restrictions make life difficult or are frequently encountered. Restrictions could include not touching bare human skin, not remaining in the presence of a symbol of faith, or not attacking without offering a chance to surrender. **You gain 5 points.**\n-   *Difficult:* These restrictions negatively impact your life daily. Restrictions could include not eating food that you have not killed and prepared yourself, not touching metal, or not harming a living being. **You gain 10 points.**\n\n**Part 2: Negative Effects**\n\n-   Power Negation: All of the affected powers simply stop working when the Taboo is broken, until you Atone. **You gain 5 points per power affected.**\n-   Physical Weakness: All of your ability scores are reduced by 2 until you Atone. **You gain 5 points.**\n-   Impossibility: It is simply impossible for you to break this Taboo. You are physically incapable of doing so. If you are somehow forced to do so, you must dedicate you efforts into no longer breaking the Taboo in the most efficient manner possible. Since you cannot willingly break this Taboo, there is no atonement option. **You gain 10 points.**\n-   Incapacitating Weakness: After initial violation of the Taboo you lose 1d8 stamina that bypasses all Damage resistance at the end of every turn until they atone or fall unconscious. They remain so until they Atone, which might be difficult if they are unconscious. **You gain 10 points.**\n-   Fatal Weakness: After breaking the Taboo, you begin to lose 1 wound every minute you reach 0 wounds, at which point you die. This process ends if you atone, but unless the Atonement is simple it is very unlikely to happen before death. **You gain 15 points.**\n\n**Part 3: Atonement**\n\n-   Simple Atonement: Atonement for breaking this Taboo is simple to perform and requires no special materials. It might involve spending an hour in prayer, or running a system reset. Even a simple atonement should take at least a scene to perform. **You gain 0 points.**\n-   Difficult Atonement: Atonement for breaking this Taboo is difficult to perform, requiring at least a day, and perhaps special materials not easily available after Z-Day. It might involve burning incense or finding electronic equipment to replace fused wiring. **You gain 5 points.**\n-   Atonement Quest: Atonement for breaking this Taboo involves a heroic quest that should be the subject of its own Issue, or perhaps even Mini-Series. It might involve tracking down an android’s original programmer, a ghost returning to the distant place of their death to reconnect with their old life or passing a series of spiritual trials to reconnect with mystic power. **You gain 10 points.**\n\n# Step 6: Choosing your Skill Sets and starting Feat\n\n*“What you know keeps you alive. Who you are shapes how you survive.”*\n\nForget ticking boxes for every individual skill, Rotted Capes doesn’t care if you’re trained in ‘Driving’ or ‘History.’ We care who you were when the world ended… and what kind of survivor you became after.\n\nInstead of traditional skills, you create a Skill Set, narrative-driven bundles of experience that reflect your background, instincts, and training. Each one tells a story: Were you a Combat Medic, a Conspiracy Theorist, an Enclave Watchman, or a washed-up Pop Star with a sharp ear for danger?\n\nSkill Sets are designed for cinematic play. They’re flexible. They reward creativity. They’re not about niche technical proficiencies; they’re about who your character is, what they’ve been through, and how they tackle problems in a world that doesn’t play fair.\n\n\\<side bar\\>  \n*Character creation ride-along: Step 4 Skills and Feats*\n\nRuben decides that his hero was a detective before Z’day who himself after has done damn well, so he chooses to go with two Skill Sets: “*Former Law Enforcement Detective”* and *“Uban Survivalist”* writing up a quick description for each and then chooses *Improved Burnout Threshold* for his bonus feat.\n\n**Former Law Enforcement Detective***  \nYou’ve walked the beat, worked the cases, and seen how bad the world could get before the dead started walking. You're trained to assess scenes, read people, and pursue leads with dogged determination. Great for investigation, interrogation, and keeping your cool under pressure.*\n\n**Urban Survivalist***  \nYou knew the city before it fell, and you know it even better now that it's rotting. You move through alleys like arteries, scavenge what others miss, and vanish before things go out loud. Ideal for scavenging, stealth, navigating urban decay, and staying alive off scraps.*\n\nNani decides that her hero has been around for a long time, and she likes the sample Skill Set, “I’ve Seen Empires Rise and Fall.” She decides to go with that one and opts to choose two feats, selecting *Learn Combat Maneuver* twice (learning Devastating Attack and Shoulder Charge)*.*\n\n*I’ve Seen Empires Rise and Fall  \nYou’ve watched the world change, slowly, brutally, beautifully. Whether you’re two hundred years old or just extremely well-read and widely traveled, your perspective gives you an edge. You shine when recognizing patterns, understanding cultures, and navigating crises with the calm of someone who’s seen worse.*\n\nNani notes that she acquired Learn Maneuver twice and Seasoned Survivor though her skill sets, she chooses the unique device feat for her sword as her bonus feat. Looking over maneuvers she picks Devastating Attack and Team Attack.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n## \\<h2\\> Starting Skills Sets, Feats, and Languages.\n\nYou start with one Skill Set and one feat of your choice. Additionally, you have the choice of taking a second skill set or an additional feat.\n\nWhile heroes with the *Highly Trained* Origin gain an additional Skill Set or Feat of their choice.\n\n*Starting Languages:* You also start knowing how to read and write your native language, as well as an additional number of languages equal to your Intelligence bonus.\n\n### \\<H3\\> Crafting a Skill Set\n\nA Skill Set represents your hero’s background, instincts, and learned experience, the things they fall back on when the powers burn out and the bullets run dry. They’re not individual skills or static bonuses. They’re cinematic, story-driven narrative roles that shape how your character tackles problems in the world of Rotted Capes.\n\nWhen crafting a Skill Set, think in broad strokes. What kind of survivor are you? Were you a Combat Medic? A Grifter? A Street Prophet who claims they saw Z-Day coming?\n\n**What makes a well-crafted Skill Set?**\n\n-   A clear narrative name, this can be cinematic or deadpan (e.g., “Ex-Special Forces Operative, Urban Explorer,” “Field Surgeon,” “Black Market Scavenger”, “Hair to the mask”, “Trained by the Brotherhood of Assassins”)\n-   A small description of what the Skill Set entails, giving a general overview of the capabilities afforded by your skill set while giving your hero a bit of flavor or style, like how your character learned these skills or how they apply them\n\n*Quick Overview: Using Skill Sets in Play*\n\nWhenever your hero attempts an action that would reasonably fall within one of their Skill Sets, you roll with your Rank bonus and your chosen ability scores bonus.\n\nLater, as you gain Feats or level up, you can expand these Skill Sets with Edges, specific areas of focused expertise that double your rank bonus when relevant (see the Skills chapter for Full Edge rules).\n\nSkill Sets aren’t about micromanaging each skill; they’re about telling the table who you are and what you’re good at.\n\nHere are some examples of Skill Sets\n\n*Masked Detective*   \nYou’ve read the files, walked through the alleys, and followed the threads. You’re not just tough, you’re sharp. Ideal for investigation, intuition, and unraveling schemes before anyone else sees them.\n\n*Street Magician*  \nYou’ve got fast hands and a smooth tongue. Whether it’s palming a coin or distracting someone with a well-timed card trick, you live by sleight of hand and misdirection. Great for infiltration, charm, or escaping sticky situations.\n\n*Ex-Military Operative*  \nYou’ve served special ops, black-ops, or just a hardened grunt. You know how to clear rooms, plan ambushes, and survive when everything goes to hell. Use this set for tactics, weapon proficiency, or intimidating green survivors into shape.\n\nFor more sample skill sets, see chapter XX: Skill Sets. pg. XX\n\n# Step 7 Starting Gear\n\nYou start with a go-bag and a few other items, for a list of gear on see pg XX.\n\nAll Heroes begin play with the following: see gear page XX\n\n-   A single firearm or an archaic ranged weapon.\n-   A single melee weapon.\n-   A single go-bag.\n-   You also start with 3 Acquisition Points, which you may spend on additional gear; you might gain additional points though feats.\n\n\\<side bar\\>  \n*Character creation ride-along: Step 7 Starting Gear*\n\nRuban and Nani now choose their starting gear,\n\nRuban chooses a medium auto-pistol and a combat knife as his weapons, and a Survivalist Go-Bag and chooses to spend his 3 Acquisition Points to get Tactical Body Armor.\n\nNani chooses a heavy revolver and a hand axe as her weapons, a Survivalist Go-Bag, and chooses to use her 3 Acquisition Points to get a Multi-Tool, Tactical Laser point sight, And Simple Night Vision goggles.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n# Step 8 Attributes & Defenses\n\n*Now we determine your starting defenses and other attributes*   \n  \n\\<side bar\\>  \n*Character creation ride-along: Step 8 Defenses and Attributes*   \nNow our players are in the home stretch and need to do the final mechanical touches to their heroes.\n\nRuban and Nani have a rank bonus of +1.\n\nNow, to Defenses, Ruban looks at his finalized ability scores and chooses his intelligence for his Avoidance, Constitution for his Fortitude defense, and his Charisma for his Willpower defense, giving him starting defenses of Avoidance: 14, Fortitude: 13, and Willpower: 15. He notes his Quick feat gives him a +1 bonus to his Avoidance setting it at 15.\n\nNani does the same, choosing her Dexterity for her Avoidance, Strength for her Fortitude, and Wisdom for her Willpower defense, giving her final defenses of Avoidance: 12, Fortitude: 15, and Willpower: 13. Her final Fortitude is 17 thanks to her toughness feat.\n\nStamina, being the sub of all of one’s defenses, is 43 for Ruban and 51 (41 +10 from Toughness feat) for Nani. And they both start with 3 wounds.\n\nPace and Initiative both rely on dexterity, giving Ruban a pace of 2 (thanks to the *Quick* feat) and a +0 bonus to initiative, and Nani a pace of 2 and a +2 bonus to initiative.\n\nBurnout Threshold: The base burnout threshold is 10. Ruban learned the feat *Increase Burnout Threshold,* so his burnout threshold is 15\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### Rank Bonus\n\nThis bonus is equal to your hero’s rank, so you start with a Rank bonus of +1\n\n### Grit\n\nAs first mentioned on page XX, your Grit bonus is added to saving throws. Your Grit is equal to your Rank, which can be further adjusted by your Origin or feats you may have purchased during hero creation.\n\n### Defenses\n\nDefenses reflect your ability to avoid or resist attacks of all kinds, with each defense dependent upon one of two ability scores. You possess three defenses.\n\n**Avoidance**\n\nAvoidance is your ability to read incoming attacks and dodge them. It combines elements of your athleticism and logic. Whenever an attack seeks to strike you physically, the attack targets your Avoidance Defense. Armor and benefits from shields adversely modify avoidance.\n\nAvoidance = 10 + Dexterity Modifier or your Intelligence Modifier + Rank (+1)\n\n**Fortitude**\n\nFortitude is the Hero’s ability to withstand severe trauma, poisons, and diseases. It combines elements of your health and conditioning. Whenever an attack inflicts trauma on your health and physical well-being, the attack targets your Fortitude Defense.\n\nFortitude = 10 + Strength Modifier or your Constitution Modifier+ Rank (+1)\n\n**Willpower**\n\nWillpower is your ability to overcome hardship, resist attacks on the mind, and remain focused in the face of distraction. It combines elements of your force of personality and insight. Whenever an attack seeks to deceive or dominate you, the attack targets the Hero’s Willpower Defense\n\nWillpower = 10 + Charisma Modifier or your Wisdom Modifier+ Rank (+1)\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>  \n**Difference between defenses and saving throws:**\n\nDefenses are your first line of defense against many effects, while saving throws are commonly used to represent shaking off or otherwise ending an ongoing effect.\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>\n\n### Health\n\nYour health, stamina, and wounds reflect your ability to endure physical harm and suffering.\n\n**Stamina**\n\nStamina represents you’re staying power during combat; it is not just your physical toughness, but it's also your endurance under duress.\n\nWhen determining your stamina, you only apply your base defenses with no conditional modifiers. (such as those provided by powers or feats). When your Defenses advance (see Advancement, page xx), your Stamina increases accordingly.\n\nStamina = Avoidance Defense + Fortitude Defense + Willpower Defense\n\n**Wounds**\n\nWounds represent your Hero’s ability to absorb raw, physical trauma.\n\nWounds = heroes possess 3 wounds or half your constitution modifier whichever is greater.\n\n### Pace\n\nPace represents how fast you can run. You can move a maximum number of areas in a round equal to their Dexterity Modifier (minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5). This may be further increased through Powers or feats.\n\n### Initiative\n\nYou have an Initiative Bonus, which is equal to your Dexterity Modifier, which may be increased through Powers or feats.\n\nInitiative = Dexterity Modifier\n\n### Burnout Threshold \\`\n\nSome powers cause stress and fatigue on a Hero, occasionally reaching a point where the Hero’s powers stop working for a time. This may leave them vulnerable to zombie infection or being served as dinner.\n\nYour Burnout Threshold starts at 10 or 15 if you choose the Increase Burnout Threshold feat\n\n# The Finishing Touch\n\n## Personality Flaws\n\n*I remember The Hood telling me once that there’s always something that separates us from the bystanders, a darkness that keeps us from ever being like them. She called it “compensation” for our empowerment. Sometimes it’s attached to our powers, but more often it’s attached to our hearts. It’s a weakness that others like us can exploit.*\n\n*I never really understood what she meant until Z-Day hit. Fighting to survive certainly turned up the pressure and for every ‘superhero’ I saw rise from the ashes, I saw that darkness as well. Sometimes it brought out the best in heroes; I’ve seen superheroes that could’ve easily escaped stand in the way of a zombie horde just to buy some time for fleeing bystanders. Sometimes it brings out the worst; I’ve seen superheroes rationalize throwing one or two weaker bystanders into the clutches of the zombies just to buy time to escape.*\n\n*This darkness, this flaw, is different for each of us, but it’s undeniably a part of all of us. I can’t explain why, but then again I can’t explain shooting jets of flame from fingertips or super strength either. Sometimes, it just is.*\n\n\\<side bar\\>  \n*Character creation ride along: The Finishing Touches*   \nFirst off both players pick their personality flaws.\n\nRuben picks Darwinist and Young Gun, with his tagline being “ha, you thought you had me.”\n\nNani is picked as Impatient and Overconfident, with her tagline being “Taste the lighting.”\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### Personality Flaws in Play\n\nPersonality flaws are one of the mechanisms that allow you to acquire plot points. at any time you, the editor-in-chief, or a fellow player can activate one of your personality flaws, if you accept the consequences with grace you gain a plot point, for more information on plot points see page XX\n\n### Choosing a personality flaw\n\nEvery player must choose at least one personality flaw. These flaws are the iconic double-edged sword; they can benefit your hero just as much as they can hinder. This is in addition to any flaws you may have gained though your Origin.\n\n### Always a Sidekick\n\n*Look, whatever you guys want to do is fine by me. I wish Shooting Star was still here; he always pointed me in the right direction.*\n\nYou were a sidekick in the Glory Days and you still haven’t come to grips with the fact that you’re a top dog. You always look to others to fill the “hero” role, and you’re happy to work alongside them – or maybe just a step or two behind them.\n\n### Berserker\n\n*You crave battle and the madness it brings.*\n\nOnce you start fighting you don’t stop. Tactical plans, your orders, the objective, it all goes out the window once combat commences. Unlike Bloodthirsty, you don’t look for excuses to start fights, but once they start you keep going until no one is left standing… and that might mean friends as well as foes.\n\n### Bloodthirsty\n\n*Cool it, man! He stole the can of tuna because he was hungry; you don’t have to beat him to a bloody pulp over it.*\n\nYou have a brutal temper that borders on sadism. You enjoy beating enemies to a bloody pulp and often look for the flimsiest excuse to consider someone an enemy.\n\n### Chilling Presence\n\n*Hey, don’t creep up on me like that! You know, I always thought it was just the costume, but you’ve got that moody,*\n\n*scary thing going on even when you aren’t wearing one.*\n\nWhether it’s the way you look, the way you sound when you talk, the way you carry yourself, or a bit of all three, you unnerve people. They don’t want to be close to you and, at times, wouldn’t mind if the zombies got you.\n\n### Clumsy\n\n*I know that you’re twice the width of the average Joe, but that still doesn’t excuse you from knocking things down in front of me when we’re trying to keep one step ahead of the zombies!*\n\nYou are clumsy by nature and tend to bump or fumble things at the wrong time. You also tend to drop or break things (especially if they’re fragile), and can easily find the one chunk of loose pavement to trip over, no matter how carefully you step.\n\n### Combat Paralysis\n\n*You tend to freeze up in stressful situations.*\n\nWhen the going gets tough, you tend to not go anywhere. In times of stress (such as combat and the like), you ‘lock up,’ neither moving nor reacting for a few actions. You better hope you have friends, or you’re not going to live much longer.\n\n### Craven\n\n*Forget B-Lister, you act more like a Super-Villain’s cowardly minion – or comic relief. You jump at shadows, shriek at the slightest threat of violence, and are quite afraid of… well, absolutely everything.*\n\nDuring the Glory Days you were a Hero’s expert or Villain’s minion; you were never called upon to fight and you actually can’t stand violence. You firmly believe that discretion is the better part of valor and avoid conflict whenever possible.\n\n### Darwinist\n\n*Sometimes you need to sacrifice one to save many.*\n\nYou won’t go out of your way to save a Bystander when the odds don’t favor it and you aren’t adverse to allowing slow or wounded Bystanders “take one for the team” and save the rest. While you may be able to convince Bystanders and other Heroes of the necessity of your actions, they often find it difficult to live with once you’re past the immediate danger.\n\n### Greedy\n\n*You know that little girl needs your antibiotics, but you may need them some day! You found them, and they are yours, damn it!*\n\nYou are very possessive of items you salvage; you have a stock pile of stuff and will go out of your way to get more, risking life and limb in the process. You are also fully capable of hiding things you find from your fellow survivors.\n\n### Gremlins\n\n*You and technology have never been the best of friends.*\n\nTo say you have trouble using any electronic devices made after 1975 is an understatement. Whenever you’re around, computers tend to crash, cellphones build static and drop calls, sensitive scanners go haywire, newer cars stall out at the worst moments (or simply refuse to start in the first place), and so on.\n\n### Haunted by Nightmares\n\n*You see the zombies in your sleep.*\n\nYou have trouble sleeping through the night without zombies infecting your dreams. At times it’s so bad that they appear in your daydreams as well.\n\n### The Hero’s Code\n\n*Look, I get it. You want to fight for freedom, justice, and mom’s apple pie. But take a look around; it’s all gone, flushed down a zombie toilet. Why can’t you see that?*\n\nWhether you actually believe in it or are just using it to hold on to your sanity, you continue to follow the unwritten code of superheroes to an extreme. You do not lie, cheat, or steal, even to survive. You treat super zombies as honorably would any other supervillain or henchman.\n\n### Hero Worship\n\n*If Lady Liberty were here, she’d try to save those Bystanders. If I want to prove myself worthy of carrying on her mantle, I’ll need to try to save them as well.*\n\nYou idolize a particular hero or villain. You try to live by their code and remind others about their deeds. You may even model your own super identity on that hero or villain. Note that the subject of your worship need not be dead or Z’d and your subject may not be too happy to have you using her handle.\n\n### Impatient\n\n*You have no capacity for repetitive tasks or waiting around and have a short attention span.*\n\nYou can’t stand sitting around and making plans; the zombies are everywhere and they’re closing in all the time! You want to act, now! Unfortunately, your impatience often leads you into danger with no preparation.\n\n### Lone Wolf\n\n*Look, we voted and I’m the leader, remember? I want us to survive just as much as you do. Why do you keep second-guessing me and undermining my authority?*\n\nWhile you understand the concept of safety in numbers, you just don’t work well with a group. Someone is always holding you back or supporting a clearly inferior course of action. You’d just rather be on your own, taking support only when you need it.\n\n### Lying Eyes\n\n*Your tongue may be clever, but your eyes betray you.*\n\nNo one trusts you. Maybe it’s the way you carry yourself, maybe it’s because you make unconvincing arguments, or maybe it’s because you really don’t care. In any case, you have a difficult time convincing people of what you say.\n\n### Megalomania\n\n*I’ve been telling you for years that only through an iron fist does civilization stand a chance! Look at the world now! Once I establish order we’ll wipe away the zombies once and for all!*\n\nYou were a power-mad super villain (albeit a low-powered one) during the Glory Days and Z-Day changed nothing. While you protect Bystanders and work with Heroes, you do so out of a desire to establish a new world order, with you at the top.\n\n### Nihilistic\n\n*Even if we do destroy all the zombies, then what? Look around you, guys, this world is over. We’ve got nothing to look forward to but ruins and memories.*\n\nYou’ve given up hope. You survive because you must, if only to help others, but you just don’t see a glimmer of a bright future anywhere on the horizon. When things seem hopeless you’re strangely content, and it’s difficult to get you to fight against the odds.\n\n### Oblivious\n\n*Hey guys, why are you all sneaking up the stairs with your guns drawn?*\n\nYou are oblivious most of the time; maybe you suffer from extreme ADHD or have simply drawn into yourself. Regardless of the cause, there are times you ignore or fail to notice what is right in front of you.\n\n### Overconfident\n\n*There’s nothing you can’t overcome.*\n\nWhile others believe that discretion is the better part of valor, you rush in where angels fear to tread. You have complete confidence in your abilities as well as those of your companions, which sometimes leads to taking on more than you can chew.\n\n### Over Protective\n\n*What do you mean, “If we send out a group maybe some of them will come back?” We can’t treat Bystanders like cattle! I’ve been protecting this enclave since Z-Day. They’re my children!*\n\nYou are extremely over-protective of the Bystanders in your enclave and treat each of them as you would your children (and you dote on your children). This makes the hard choices even more difficult for you, and you take the loss of any Bystander extremely hard.\n\n### Patriot\n\n*Sure things look tough, but we’re Americans! Our nation was born in troubled times and we’ve weathered worse! We’ll get through this so long as we never forget our ideals!*\n\nYou strongly believe in something, usually the nation of your birth, and you optimistically hold on to its ideals, laws, and principles. Your patriotism is often at odds with reality, and many fellow Heroes and Bystanders aren’t appreciative of your love for the Golden Age.\n\n### Poor Substitute\n\n*What do you mean, ‘I’m too young to be the Night Ranger’? I kept the city safe from Mega Master countless times! Of course I don’t have all the trick arrows anymore; I lost them years ago!*\n\nYou have not only taken on the mantle of an old superhero, you’re starting to believe that you are that superhero. Unfortunately, this goes far beyond roleplaying; at times you believe that you have access to powers that you simply don’t have, which can be dangerous when the zombie horde is surrounding you.\n\n### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n\n*You have seen the dark face of the apocalypse; it’s changed you, and you’re on the edge of losing it, all the time.*\n\nNot only brought on through combat build, PTSD can be brought on by any violent traumatic build, like a zombie apocalypse. You are always on edge; you jump at loud noises and fly off the handle sometimes despite yourself. It’s hard for you to sleep, but when you do, you sleep with a knife at your side and a gun under your pillow.\n\n### Revolutionary\n\n*You disagree with how your enclave is governed and you make no attempt to hide your disapproval.*\n\nYou are constantly at odds with the leadership of your enclave and actively support replacing it with another type of government. Unfortunately, you usually hold the minority opinion and most Bystanders worry that your position may one day threaten the enclave.\n\n### Ruthless\n\n*You are a reformed Super-Villain or amoral hero and you try to do the right thing, but you still lack compassion for others.*\n\nYou have no appreciation for the feelings of others and fake compassion as best you can. You know that what you’re doing now is right, but you might as well be a robot as far as your feelings are concerned. You often look to other heroes to see how you should be feeling.\n\n### Survivor’s Guilt\n\n*Many Bystanders in your enclave have fearfully left a friend or loved one to the clutches of zombies but they never expected it from a hero. You let someone die in a moment of weakness and no matter how much you try to make up for it, Bystanders never let you forget it.*\n\nYou just can’t put your moment of weakness behind you. Not only is it brought up every time you offer an opinion on a course of action, but the friends and loved ones of the person you deserted occasionally try to exact revenge.\n\n### Too Much of a Good Thing\n\n*There is attractive, and then there’s you.*\n\nYou look good, even in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. It might be due to your super-human powers, a lucky roll of the genetic dice, or all of the work you had done before Z-Day.\n\nUnfortunately, people equate your looks with your intelligence and general level of skill, figuring your IQ equals your shoe size. Either that, or you must deal with a string of unwanted suitors or people trying to protect you from harm, lest your good looks become tarnished.\n\n### Unlucky\n\n*Lady Luck wants to see you get eaten by zombies.*\n\nYou can’t put your finger on it, but you just have the worst luck. Two paths? The one you take is filled with zombies. Have a weakness? Count on it to be incorporated into the next super zombie’s costume.\n\n### Unattractive\n\n*You never did look good in spandex due to that pot belly. The prescription eyeglasses don’t help either.*\n\nFor whatever reason, people that would normally be attracted to you find you homely at best and quite possibly repulsive.\n\n### Villainous Past\n\n*Yes, you keep saying that the Z-Day changed everything, but you know what? I don’t care. Before the Z-Day you were an arrogant, megalomaniacal, narcissistic SOB with blood on your gloves. I still don’t trust you.*\n\nYou were a rather public and sinister supervillain before the Z-Day and you can’t shake your reputation. You are treated poorly, constantly watched, and always the first suspect whenever something bad happens that doesn’t involve zombies.\n\n### Young Gun\n\n*You are so young it’s hard for others to take you seriously, as a result you constantly compensate in a desperate bid to gain respect.*\n\nWhen others are watching, you are exceedingly reckless, all in an attempt to gain some level of respect. You always volunteer for dangerous missions and leap headlong into “heroic” situations.\n\n### Xenophobia\n\n*You really don’t like strangers*.\n\nYou are immediately suspicious and intolerant toward anyone that isn’t part of your survivalist enclave. It takes a long time for a stranger to gain your trust.\n\n### Zealot\n\n*We brought this on ourselves. Only if we truly repent and ask for forgiveness will this nightmare be over.*\n\nWhether you were a person of faith before or found religion in the aftermath of Z-Day, you now strongly hold on to its teachings. Your faith may not be exactly what that faith taught in the Glory Days (you’ve had to interpret a lot on your own) and some of your interpretations may be quite fanciful, but you firmly believe in it. You want – need – everyone else to join you.\n\n## Taglines\n\n*There was another thing we all had in common; each and every one of us had a tagline. Yes, I realize it was kind of silly, and most heroes’ taglines seemed almost forced. But it was one of those unwritten traditions we all followed.*\n\n*Back in the day, the media would do most of the work for us; I still remember how they stuck Armory with “Stand Back” after they caught him saying it on the news two times… never mind the fact that he was telling bystanders and members of his own team to basically get out of the way. But before you knew it, there he was yelling “Stand Back” right before he would let loose with some new weapon or right before he would land the telling blow.*\n\n*We all have taglines, and the bystanders eat it up; it seems to give them some hope. At least some of us have hope left.*\n\n### Taglines in play\n\nOnce per scene, you may utter the tagline as you perform any action. Depending on how well you use the tagline in the moment you may get rewarded with a plot point which you may them immediately use. Make the use of a tagline dramatic! That’s what they are for.\n\n**Example:** Velocity flashes by a super zombie, coming out of nowhere catching it and his fellow heroes by surprise.\n\nLooking up at the Editor-in-Chief he says “Ha! You never saw that coming”, activating his tagline and getting a free Plot Point reroll.\n\n### Choosing a Tagline\n\nPlayers should choose a tagline during character creation, or they can start play without one and allow the other players, and bystanders (aka the Editor-in-Chief) to choose one for them.\n\nA tagline should be quick sentence or saying, a call to battle, or a quip commonly used by the Hero.\n\nHere are some examples\n\n“You never saw that coming” – Velocity\n\n“Turn it up!” – Sonic Boom\n\n“I am the night!” – The Hood\n\n“Protectors, take them down!” – Sentinel\n\n# The Cast\n\n*I’m telling you I have seen some amazing things since Z-Day. Through all the blood and death, I have seen ruthless men become selfless heroes.*\n\n*I don’t know, maybe it’s a defense mechanism, a primal need to gather, form family, and protect our fellow man. There are so few of us that maybe our inner caveman needs us to form tribes and look upon our each other as brother and sister, instead of competitors or prey.*\n\n*Zombie survival stories are never truly about the zombies, but the survivors. These stories bring together radically different people and force them to come together, and grow closer.*\n\nIn this last step, we create those personal bonds between your heroes and the survivors under your care. Every zombie story has its supporting cast, and it’s those stories between your characters and those they care about that make *things truly matter*.  \n  \nMaybe you saved them. Maybe they saved you. Maybe you just haven’t gotten rid of them yet. Whatever the story, you’ve got people in your corner, friends, family, survivors, ex-sidekicks, scavengers, or weirdos who somehow make your life more complicated *and* more survivable.\n\nUnlike character creation, creating the cast can be more collaborative effort. It should be done during Session 0, with all players together at the table, online, or via a group chat.\n\nOnce everyone is together, have each person describe one or two members of their cast. These cast members aren’t trained soldiers, elite hackers, or ex-heroes. They’re survivors. When creating a Cast member, choose **one** Skill Set from the **Common Background List** below. These are broad, grounded, and intentionally *not optimal*. They reflect common jobs, roles, or lives lived before Z-Day.\n\n### **Common Background Skill Sets**\n\nThese Skill Sets are available to all Cast members at no cost.\n\n-   **Caretaker** (basic first aid, childcare, community support)\n-   **Teacher** (history, critical thinking, organizing people)\n-   **Handyman** (simple repair, tool use, fix-it knowledge)\n-   **Cook** (meal planning, food preservation, basic chemistry)\n-   **Custodian** (scavenging, cleaning chemicals, building familiarity)\n-   **Retail Worker** (bartering, crowd management, survival in chaos)\n-   **Farmhand** (animal handling, gardening, weather sense)\n-   **Librarian** (research, knowledge of obscure topics, filing systems)\n-   **Bus Driver** (vehicle familiarity, basic navigation)\n-   **Janitor** (lock keys, maintenance shortcuts, problem-solving)\n-   **Parent** (emotional support, multitasking, comfort)\n-   **Veteran** *(but not Special Forces)* (basic first aid, discipline, simple tactics, firearms safety)\n\n### These Skill Sets only provide +1 when attempting to meet a challenge, regardless of the ability score used.\n\n### **Collaborative Flaws: Everyone Has Baggage**\n\nSurvivors aren’t clean slates. They come with trauma, damage, regrets, and secrets. Your Cast is no different.\n\nOnce everyone’s cast members are created, you may propose a *personality quirk* for another player's Cast member.\n\nSomething like:\n\n-   \"Your sister thinks you're still a cape and keeps calling you out when you hide it.\"\n-   \"Your tech guy hoards batteries. Like... weirdly hoards them.\"\n-   \"The medic you saved is terrified of Zs and panics if you leave their side.\"\n\nIf you accept a proposed *personality quirk*, your cast member gets a skill set defined by you (replacing their common background skill set). Additionally, choose two ability scores, which grant them a +2 bonus when using either of those ability scores to meet a challenge.\n\nThis doesn’t make the character stronger in isolation; it simply makes them more interesting. The Editor-in-Chief may choose to invoke this *personality quirk* once per Issue to create drama, tension, or complication.\n\n### **In Play**\n\nSupporting Cast members are roleplayed by the Editor-in-Chief unless you choose to speak for them. They don’t need stat blocks unless the story demands it, and they’re not cannon fodder; losing one is like losing a piece of yourself. Treat them with care. Or don’t. That’s on you.\n\n### \\<side bar\\> **Your Crew**\n\nIn *Rotted Capes*, your hero never stands alone. *Your* *Crew* consists of you (your hero), **any Allies or Supporting Cast** you’ve defined during character creation, and in some cases, **cast members** who consistently operate alongside you.\n\nAnyone in your Crew can attempt to meet a Challenge, especially a **Spotlight Challenge, i**f they’ve got the right Skill Set and narrative access.\n\nSometimes your medic saves the day. Sometimes it’s the gearhead fixing a downed drone. If a Challenge demands expertise, and your hero doesn’t have it, look to your Crew.\n\nRemember, zombie apocalypse stories are not necessarily about zombies; they are about the survivors and how they navigate a world transformed by an ever-present threat. Your crew is not just a collection of background characters; they’re part of the story.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n","size_bytes":158946},"docs/2.2_Skills 4.1.md":{"content":"Skill Sets\n\n*Good morning. My name is Kath O'Malley. I've been asked to pass on a few little nuggets of information. With my powers, they should sink in. Just kidding! I wouldn't do that to you.*\n\n*First, treat this world like it's Noah's Ark. Always travel in pairs. It doesn't matter what you have to do, always have someone keep an eye on you. If you need to pee or take a dump, the time for being shy is over. The last thing you want is some zombie attacking you with your literal pants down.*\n\n*Second, remember, fire is your best friend in this apocalypse. It's the only treatment for zombie bites. Always have a way to make fire-hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, matches, a lighter, and some type of cloth. Then, be prepared to treat the burn. Keep a close watch on the bite victim. If you see signs of infection, you may have to make a tough call. But remember, you're in control. Act quickly and quietly. And if the worst happens and the victim turns into a super zombie, remember, you have the power to end it.*\n\n*Third, zombies, for the most part, are stupid. They don't use tools. They can't open doors or windows. They can't get out of seat belts. They can't climb ladders. They tend to be slow and clumsy. All they want to do is feed. Single zombies are generally no threat. They should be taken out quietly. If you go in guns blazing, the sound will draw every zombie for miles. Zombies are attracted by sound and movement. If they see you move, they will follow you. Sound can be your friend. Car alarms, car radios, boom boxes, and anything that makes noise will attract zombies. Just make sure you aren't seen while setting off your noisemakers.*\n\n*Then there are the super zombies. These zombies are apex predator-eating machines. They have no morality, and their intellects are intact. You want to avoid them at all costs. There is a rumor that super zombies can acquire more powers by eating other supers. If I am bitten and in danger of turning, please blow my head off. My powers are emotion control, mind control, and telepathy. If I become a super zombie, I can easily fool the guards, walk right into camp, and discreetly start feeding on who I want to.*\n\n*Fourth, dogs. Dogs are no longer man's best friend. They are territorial, travel in packs, and most haven't had their rabies shots. There is no cure for rabies, just a long, painful death.*\n\n*Fifth, other survivors. You never know what to expect from other survivors. Mel Brooks wrote a song, \"Hope for the Best. Expect the Worst\". Other survivors are just as scared of you as you are of them. Some may offer trade. Some may be just barely getting by. Some may just be ready to shoot you and loot your corpse. Just be cautious.*\n\n*You can almost always tell a building that has people. The windows will be boarded up on the first floor. The smallest window will have a big pile of garbage outside of it. People don't want to live in their own filth. Bodies may have been burned or possibly buried. If there are bodies in the street, check the position the body is in. You may figure out where other survivors are sniping from.*\n\n*On scavenging. Don't kick in every door. Learn to pick locks. Also, make a little noise before going in. You may hear zombies stumbling around the place, even the clack, clack, clack of gnashing teeth. If a building has large glass doors or windows, and you must break them to get in, try to break the lower portions and crawl in. Zombies are too stupid to crawl in after you.*\n\n*Always look for traps. Super zombies still have their intellects. Snares and tripwire may hurt or cripple you, but you're still fresh meat. Also, survivors will protect a stash. Some \"Last Man on Earth\" may have a whole series of booby traps protecting his place.*\n\n*Always shop with a list. Just get the stuff you need and get home safely. Are there things you should always look out for? Absolutely. Multivitamins. Unless you live on a farm, your diet is canned crap. First aid supplies. Fire extinguishers. There is no 911 service. Ammunition. If you need personal items, bring someone with you. Don't be embarrassed if you need underwear or tampons.*\n\n*Thanks for listening. Please come back alive and in one piece.*\n\nIn this chapter, we break down **Skill Sets** and how to use them to tell your stories.\n\nRather than selecting individual skills, *Rotted Capes* uses Skill Sets; **punchy, thematic descriptions** that reflect your hero’s background, training, and survivor experience. Instead of being trained in something narrow like \"Engineering\" or \"Stealth,\" your hero might be a *former law enforcement officer* and an *amateur athlete*, or a *retired intelligence operative* with an *obsession for old sci-fi movies.*\n\nDon’t underestimate what you can learn from movies…  \n*“I have an idea. Hey, do you remember that old movie... Aliens?”*\n\nWhat we give you here is nowhere near a complete list of possible Skill Sets. Instead, look at this as a **launch pad** with a few dozen examples to ignite ideas. Take one as-is, tweak it to fit your hero, or invent something brand new. The rules aren’t here to **constrain your creativity**; they're here to **unlock it**.\n\nThe following rules are **basic guidelines**, a flexible framework that gives both you and the Editor-in-Chief what you need to **keep things moving**, tell cinematic stories, and hopefully **keep you from becoming Super-Z’s chow.**\n\n# Using Ability Scores and Skill Sets\n\nThroughout the game, there will be moments when your hero’s abilities will be tested. Maybe you're negotiating with the leader of a desperate enclave, rewiring a busted drone, sneaking past an occupied Super-Z, or sprinting across a collapsing rooftop, these events are referred to as Challenges.   \n  \nChallenges are not issued for common skill use, but reserved for when failure has a tangible effect, and success moves the story forward.\n\nWhen issued a Challenge, you will either make an **ability check** or, if applicable, a **skill check** to meet the Challenge. Ability checks represent raw, innate talent. While skills are a demonstration of your experience, training, or learned instinct.\n\nWhen you are asked to make a check to meet a challenge, it’s up to you to describe to the Editor-in-Chief how one of your skill sets might apply and which ability score you wish to use on your skill check. If the Editor-in-Chief agrees, you roll your skill check; if you can’t apply any of your skill sets to the check, you instead roll a standard ability check.\n\nAbility Checks are a d20 roll + your ability score modifier. If you can apply a skill set to meet the challenge, you also get to add your rank bonus to the roll.   \n  \n\\<side bar\\>\n\n## Editor-in-Chief's Guide to Ability Scores use\n\nWhen a Challenge arises, and a player proposes a Skill Set + Ability Score combo, your job as Editor-in-Chief is to determine whether it makes sense in context. Here’s a quick cheat sheet to help you decide which ability best fits the action at hand.\n\n| **Ability**      | **Typical Use Cases**                                                           |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Strength**     | Physical force, lifting, breaking, melee power, brute intimidation.             |\n| **Dexterity**    | Stealth, agility, balance, aiming, reflex-based reaction time.                  |\n| **Constitution** | Endurance, resisting fatigue, holding breath, withstanding pain or toxins.      |\n| **Intelligence** | Academic knowledge, deductive reasoning, analysis, tech use, tactical planning. |\n| **Wisdom**       | Perception, gut instinct, emotional read, survival sense, spiritual insight.    |\n| **Charisma**     | Persuasion, leadership, deception, confidence, rallying others under pressure.  |\n\n**Editors don’t forget to let** players pitch creative combinations, like Wisdom for calming a crowd, or Intelligence for predicting an ambush. If it fits the fiction, run with it.  \n  \n\\</side bar\\>\n\n## Edges\n\nSkill Sets can have any number of Edges, which are statements that describe a particular aspect of your skill set that you are exceptionally good at. Edges should be descriptive and thought-provoking but not overly broad. Any time you meet a challenge for which you can apply an edge you add double your rank bonus to your skill check.\n\nFor example, for Combat Medic, you might have “I can stabilize anyone, anywhere,” or “I did some work for the CDC.”\n\n### Deep Cut Moments\n\nNot all Skill Sets see equal screen time. Some are highly situational or tied to specific character backstories that only occasionally take center stage. When an obscure Skill Set becomes suddenly vital, or when a challenge hits close to your hero’s personal history, it triggers a *Deep Cut Moment***.**\n\nWhen you have a *deep cut moment,* you gain **an Advantage to meet the challenge; in addition,** you earn **1 Plot Point** for leaning into your character’s unique flavor.\n\nDeep Cut Moments are a tool for spotlighting niche Skill Sets and character arcs. Don’t force them, they’re special because they’re rare. When one naturally emerges in the fiction, reward it.\n\n## Difficulty Class\n\nAny time there is a challenge, it's the Editor-In-Chief who sets your target number or Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check succeeds. Otherwise, it’s a failure, and what that failure entails is up to the Editor-In-Chief.\n\n| **Table X-X  Typical Difficulty Classes** |\n|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Difficulty Class (DC)**                 |\n| Easy (10)                                 |\n| Routine (15)                              |\n| Challenging (20)                          |\n| Daunting (25)                             |\n| Amazing (30)                              |\n| Improbable (35)                           |\n| Astounding (40)                           |\n\n## Examples of Skill Sets in Play\n\n## Example 1: \"It’s Not My First Riot\"\n\nApparitions’ team is trying to calm down a panicked group of survivors who’ve just escaped a Z’d ambush. One man is screaming at the group’s leader, threatening to leave. The Editor-in-Chief calls for a Challenge; if someone doesn’t intervene, the group will fracture and take essential supplies with them.\n\nApparitions’ player says:\n\n*“I want to step in and de-escalate, I’ve got the ‘Ex-Law Enforcement’ Skill Set, and my Focus is ‘I’ve talked down worse.’ I’m using Charisma to project calm authority and take control of the situation.”*\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief agrees that it fits the Skill Set and Focus. The Challenge DC is set at 15.\n\nApparitions’ player rolls:\n\nd20 + double their Rank Bonus + Charisma Modifier\n\n*She rolls a total of 19 and succeeds.*\n\nWith that, the Editor-in-Chief exclaims *“With the crowd calmed and order restored, the group agrees to stay,”* buying the heroes time and gaining a valuable ally.\n\n### Example 2: “Built This in My Garage”\n\nZero is trying to reactivate a rusted-out security drone buried in the wreckage of a mall. The Editor-in-Chief calls for a Challenge; if successful, the team gains a mobile scout. If not, the failure might trigger a sensor ping or damage the drone beyond use.\n\nZero’s player says:  \n*“I’m using my ‘Garage Engineer’ Skill Set. I literally rebuilt a salvaged servo-leg with a spatula and a soldering iron once. I want to roll with Intelligence.*\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief approves. The drone is fragile and long dormant, so the DC is set at 20.\n\nZero rolls:\n\nd20 + their Rank Bonus + Intelligence Modifier\n\n*She rolls a total of 12 and fails the check.*\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief rules that the drone sparks, briefly hums to life, and then shorts out completely. Worse, the noise echoes across the loading bay, something hears it.\n\n## Face-Offs\n\nMost Challenges pit a hero against the world, a crumbling rooftop, a rusted generator, a ticking bomb. But sometimes? It’s personal. A stare-down across a rooftop. A clash of ideals in front of a crowd. A digital duel in the guts of a dying server. That’s when you enter a Face-Off.\n\nIn a Face-Off, two characters roll to meet the same Challenge from opposite sides. Each side uses the relevant Ability Score and applies bonuses from any applicable Skill Sets, Edges, or powers.\n\nWhoever rolls higher wins the moment. With ties going to the initiator of the face-off,\n\nIf both sides are reacting (e.g., two defenders), the outcome is a stalemate, and neither side gains ground.\n\nFace-Offs are best reserved for moments of narrative tension, not for every debate or stealth roll. Use them when both sides matter, and when the outcome shifts the story.  \n**  \nExamples of Face-Offs:**\n\n**Shadows and Searchlights**\n\n*A hero creeps across the rooftop (Dexterity + Urban Explorer) while a bystander scans the dark (Wisdom + Enclave Watchman).*\n\n**Digital Duel**\n\n*A techno-hero tries to breach an ancient AI firewall (Intelligence + Visionary) while the AI digs in (Intelligence + Machine Security Protocol).*\n\n**Words Like Weapons**\n\n*A cult leader (Charisma + Cult Savior) rallies the frightened crowd. The hero steps forward (Charisma + Community Organizer), trying to break his hold over his followers.*\n\n## Restricted Challenges\n\nNot every Challenge can be met by just anyone. While most obstacles can be approached with creative justification, some tasks demand experience, full stop.\n\nAs Editor-in-Chief, you have the authority to decide when a Challenge is restricted, meaning it can only be attempted by a hero with a relevant Skill Set.\n\nFor general tasks, such as climbing a wall, calming a frightened civilian, or scavenging supplies, anyone can make an Ability Check. Skill Sets give an edge, context, or bonus, but they’re not mandatory. If a player can sell you on how their ability applies, let them try.\n\nBut certain actions cross a line into expertise. You don’t land a plane by guessing. You don’t perform surgery just because you’re smart. For these, the Challenge is restricted unless the character has an applicable Skill Set.\n\nExamples might include:\n\n-   Flying an aircraft (e.g., needs Pilot Training or Air Force Experience)\n-   Performing battlefield surgery (Combat Medic, Trauma Nurse)\n-   Bypassing high-level security (Tactical Infiltration, Black Hat)\n-   Reprogramming alien tech (Visionary, First Contact Specialist)\n-   Performing ancient rituals or banishments (Mystic Acolyte, Occult Scholar)\n\nIf no one at the table has the Skill Set? That’s the point. Not every door opens. Not every problem has a brute force solution. This is not punishing players, you’re preserving the spotlight. Letting anyone fly a jet makes the *Ex-Air Force Ace* feel pointless. Sometimes the best answer is: “You can’t do that… but maybe someone else in your enclave can.”\n\n### \\<h3\\> Circumstances\n\nSometimes the situation itself tips the odds, either in your favor or against you.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief may grant you Advantage or Disadvantage on a check depending on the circumstances surrounding the Challenge.\n\n*For example:*  \nSneaking down a hallway covered in soft carpet? You might get Advantage.\n\nThat same carpet, now soaked and squishy with water? You’re probably rolling with Disadvantage.\n\nWhen the environment, gear, weather, or even narrative timing makes a difference, the Editor-in-Chief has the freedom to tilt the odds accordingly.\n\nSee Advantage/Disadvantage, pg. XX, for more details.\n\n## The Right Tools for the Job\n\nHaving the right tools can mean the difference between rousing success or a catastrophic mess.\n\nWhen attempting a Skill Set check that clearly requires specific tools, such as performing field surgery, repairing a drone, or picking a high-security lock, attempting it without the proper gear imposes a -5 penalty to your roll.\n\nIf you have something that could work, improvised tools, jury-rigged gear, or a creative workaround, the Editor-in-Chief may allow the check, but with a reduced penalty of -3 instead.\n\nIn some cases, though, the Editor-in-Chief might rule that the challenge is flat-out impossible without tools, especially if it's something highly technical, delicate, or dangerous.\n\n## Failing Forward\n\nJust because you didn’t meet the Challenge doesn’t mean you *failed*, at least, not in the traditional sense.\n\nSometimes you still succeed, just not cleanly. The Editor-in-Chief may let the action succeed, but with a twist, setback, or complication. Maybe you get what you wanted, but not how you wanted it, or not without drawing attention, burning a resource, or making things worse elsewhere.\n\nIf you, the player, suggest your *own* complication, something dramatic, dangerous, or just plain cool, you might earn a **Plot Point** for leaning into it, especially if it adds something juicy to the scene.\n\nDon’t treat this like punishment; it’s an opportunity.\n\nYou’re not just failing… you’re **making the story better**.\n\nIf your idea makes the Editor-in-Chief grin, wince, or scribble in their notes, there’s a Plot Point with your name on it.\n\nSo, when things go sideways? Lean in. Make it count. Make it *memorable*.\n\n## Skills in a Fight\n\nCommonly, most of the time, meeting a Challenge in combat could be part of your normal action, such as jumping to an adjacent rooftop, noticing the fact that the ceiling might be about to come down, or noticing a super zombie hiding in the shadows about to pounce. However, sometimes a Challenge may take you longer to complete, requiring more time and attention.   \n  \nYour Editor-in-Chief assigns what kind of action the challenge might entail, anything from a bonus action to a demanding action.\n\nOnce the action type is settled upon, with the Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may then choose to meet the challenge normally, perform a *Rush Job,* or choose to *Take Your Time.*\n\n**Rush Jobs:** You can **reduce the time** the action takes by one step (e.g., from an Action to a Bonus Action), but you roll with **Disadvantage**.   \n  \n**Take Your Time:** You can **take longer** than usual, step the action *up* by one level (e.g., a Bonus Action becomes a full Action). When you do, you roll with **Advantage**.   \n  \n**Social Encounters**\n\nNot every obstacle can be punched through; sometimes, survival depends on saying the right thing at the right time.\n\nIn social encounters, your hero’s background, instincts, and experience matter just as much as their words. Maybe you were a grifter, a beat cop, a preacher, or a washed-up news anchor, whatever your story, your Skill Sets can shape how you deal with people.\n\nBefore any dice are rolled, the Editor-in-Chief will ask what you're saying and what you're trying to accomplish. If you make a strong case in-character, that may be enough, no roll required. Good roleplaying with clear intent can open doors without ever touching the dice.\n\nBut when the stakes are high, or the outcome uncertain, the Editor-in-Chief may call for a Challenge, and it’s up to you to:\n\n-   Describe **how** one of your Skill Sets applies to the situation.\n-   Propose an **Ability Score** that reflects how you're approaching the moment (Charisma to inspire, Intelligence to outmaneuver, Wisdom to read someone, etc.)\n\nModifiers may also apply depending on the circumstances—having a weapon drawn, recent shared trauma, bribes, glowing super-hands, or just plain desperation.\n\nExample,\n\n*“I’m a former Cult Survivor. I know the fear in his eyes because I used to have it. I’m not trying to intimidate him, I want to use* **Wisdom***, not my Charisma. I want him to know I understand what he’s feeling and that he’s not alone.”*\n\nThis system is intended to draw upon the character’s story and context. The more believable and logical your approach is, the better chance you'll have of swaying hearts, minds... or at least not getting shot.\n\n## Sample Skill Sets: From Grounded to Cinematic\n\nThe world’s ended, but your story hasn’t, and how you survived (or thrived) matters.\n\nWhat follows are over 40 Skill Sets to choose from: first, we have a list of more grounded skill sets followed by more cinematic options to match your style of play, a good skill sets pulls double duty, they give you skills you can use while they shape your hero’s backstory, giving them a little more depth.\n\nSome skill sets are gritty and deadpan, like former law enforcement, ex-gang muscle, combat medic. Then, later, we give you stylized nods to the kind of hero (or anti-hero) you might have been if the world hadn’t gone to hell: the billionaire playboy, the long-lived wanderer, the mask that outlived its legacy.\n\nEach Skill Set comes with a short write-up to guide how it might be used in play, and you might notice some cross over here and there, this is normal, people from completely different walks of live can commonly come at a problem from two different directions. Use these skill sets as-is, tweak them to fit, or create your own. Crafting a good skill set is simple: reflect on who your hero was before everything changed, and how that past still matters when the Z’d are clawing through the door.\n\n### Grounded Skill Set\n\n**Beat Cop**  \nYou weren’t a superhero, but you wore a badge and tried to make a difference. You know how to read a crowd, take down a threat without killing them, and recognize when someone’s about to crack. The law’s dead, but your instincts aren’t.\n\n**Confidence Artist**  \nYou don't lie. You tell better stories than the truth. You have a face people trust, a voice they lean into, and a bag full of tricks to keep them leaning until you've got what you want. In the new world, that makes you dangerous, and very, very valuable.\n\n**Corporate Power Broker**  \nYou’ve sat at the head of the table and closed deals that moved billions. You understand how systems work, how to leverage influence, bury scandals, or launch initiatives with a signature. You shine in negotiation, corporate manipulation, and turning resources into results.\n\n**Cybercriminal**  \nYou weren’t hacking for justice; you did it for profit, sabotage, or fun. But now your fingers still know how to crack firewalls, spoof signals, and manipulate old-world systems. This Skill Set thrives in digital ruins and compromised networks.\n\n**Diplomatic Protocol**  \nYou’ve been trained in political etiquette, negotiation under tension, and how to read the cues of diplomatic posturing. You know how to avoid war with a word, and when to let silence speak. Use this to navigate power structures, negotiate tense standoffs, and defuse a crisis.\n\n**Disaster Responder**  \nYou were there when the levees broke, the fires raged, or the buildings came down. Before Z-Day, you already knew how to work in chaos. You move fast, think faster, and carry people who can’t move at all. You were a frontline responder before it was cool. Or mandatory.\n\n**Entrepreneur**  \nYou used to live in a world of pitches, pivots, and backchannel deals. Negotiating is second nature, and reading people is your bread and butter. The game’s changed now, but you still know how to hustle, schmooze, and get what your team needs with a smile and a handshake. Especially if it’s not totally legal.\n\n**Ex-Military Operative**  \nYou’ve served special ops, black-ops, or just a hardened grunt. You know how to clear rooms, plan ambushes, and survive when everything goes to hell. Use this set for tactics, weapon proficiency, or intimidating green survivors into shape.\n\n**Field Engineer**  \nYou can build, repair, and improvise under pressure. Whether fixing a collapsed tunnel or building a one-use gadget from spare parts, you make things work when they shouldn’t. You shine in battlefield repair, scavenged tech builds, and makeshift defenses.\n\n**Former Publicist**  \nOnce you managed celebrity crises, now you manage scared survivors and nervous enclave leaders. You shine when smoothing tensions, shaping narratives, and getting people to follow your lead, even if they don’t want to.\n\n**Forensic Analyst**  \nLong before Z-Day, you studied patterns, blood spatter, broken routines, missing people. Now you’re still looking at evidence, only its rot patterns, claw marks, or the subtle signs of a staged scene. You're methodical, observant, and absolutely not fooled by a tidy surface.\n\n**Media Manipulation**  \nYou understand public perception, spin, and the power of image. Maybe you worked in PR, journalism, or politics, but now you use that savvy to control a room, rally a crowd, or put just the right fear into someone’s heart. Useful for influence, reputation, and strategic messaging.\n\n**Occult Hobbyist**  \nYou weren’t born to the mystic life, but you’ve dabbled. You’ve been to the wrong forums, read the forbidden texts, and survived a few strange nights. You're not sure if it’s real, but the stuff you’ve seen? The chants that work? You don’t talk about it unless you trust someone. And you rarely trust anyone.\n\n**Occult Scholar**  \nYou’ve seen the patterns in ancient books or whispered across the dark web. You know the symbols that make blood run cold and how to pronounce names that shouldn't be spoken. Others think it's nonsense, until the symbols start glowing and the dead move with purpose.\n\n**Olympic Hopeful**  \nBefore the world fell apart, you trained to be the best. Your life revolved around peak physical conditioning and competitive discipline. Now those same reflexes, bursts of strength, and team instincts are survival tools. You can vault a rooftop gap or recognize someone’s breathing pattern in a crowd—because you’ve pushed your body beyond average.\n\n**Outdoor Survivalist**  \nPre-Z-Day you were a park ranger, prepper, or survivalist nut. Now? You’re the reason the group is still breathing. This skill set helps with wilderness survival, scavenging, animal threats, and guiding groups through the wilds.\n\n**Private Investigator**  \nYou made your living in the shadows of the city, trailing cheaters, digging through lies, and asking the questions no one wanted answered. You’re skilled at reading people, noticing what’s off, and piecing together a puzzle from scraps and contradictions. You shine in investigations, tailing suspects, and uncovering hard truths, especially the ones nobody asked for.\n\n**Professional Thief**  \nYou didn’t just steal to survive, you stole for the thrill, the money, or because you were damn good at it. You know how to get in, get out, and leave no trace. Great for infiltration, causing enclaves, or bypassing security, old or new.\n\n**Saboteur**  \nYou're not here to win fair. You're here to make sure the other guy loses hard. You know where to plant the charge, when to cut the brake line, and how to vanish into the dust. Chaos is your signature, and you rarely need to pull the trigger twice.\n\n**Science YouTuber**  \nBefore the fall, you were just another face on a screen explaining particle physics with puppets and pop culture. Now, you're still breaking down complicated concepts, only it's to help your team understand how to weaponize fertilizer or rig solar panels. You make science feel like magic again.\n\n**Scientific Fieldwork**  \nYou weren’t stuck in a lab, you were out there gathering samples, running diagnostics, and solving real-world problems with limited gear. You shine in improvised analysis, problem-solving under pressure, and applying scientific principles outside sterile environments.\n\n**Strategic Command Training**  \nYou’ve been trained in battlefield tactics, threat assessment, and team coordination, whether in the military, paramilitary, or as part of a crisis response unit, or maybe even a superhero team. You’re rarely surprised and always thinking three moves ahead. You shine when organizing groups, calling plays, or seeing angles others miss.\n\n**Street Magician**  \nYou’ve got fast hands and a smooth tongue. Whether it’s palming a coin or distracting someone with a well-timed card trick, you live by sleight of hand and misdirection. Great for infiltration, charm, or escaping sticky situations.\n\n**Street Mechanic**  \nNo certifications. No paperwork. Just hands-on, knuckle-busted experience. Whether under the hood or cobbling together gear from scrap, you know how machines think. You learned it in back alleys, salvage yards, and stolen moments with working tech. You make things run, sometimes better than they were built.\n\n**Street Performer**  \nYou lived for the crowd. Sleight of hand, spoken word, or a guitar solo at dusk, you knew how to make people feel something. Now, you do the same to distract zombies, rally survivors, or disguise sleight of hand with flair. In a dead world, you're still making moments come alive.\n\n**Tactical Infiltration**  \nYou specialize in getting in where others can’t. Locks, vents, sensors, and even zombie patrols, you know how to bypass or disable them. Whether in black ops or high-end theft, you’ve earned your skill the hard way.\n\n**Undercover Operative**  \nYou've been trained to become someone else, how to blend, how to lie without blinking, how to wear the right mask for the job. You’re skilled in infiltration, social manipulation, and operating without backup.\n\n**Underworld Courier**  \nWhen someone needed something moved and couldn't trust the postal service or police, they called you. Now you still carry packages, data drives, medicines, or desperate notes, and you still get them through. You don’t ask what’s in the bag. You just get it there. Alive, if possible.\n\n**Urban Explorer**  \nYou knew how to navigate the city before the fall, now those skills are vital. Whether parkouring rooftops, avoiding Z swarms via storm drains, or scrounging in forgotten bunkers, this set helps you survive the concrete jungle.\n\n**Urban Recon Training**  \nYou’ve studied how to navigate, observe, and act within a city environment, on foot, across rooftops, through sewers, or behind a scope. Whether you were military, law enforcement, or just a skilled freelancer, you’re the eyes and ears in hostile territory.\n\n**Visionary**  \nWhere others see scrap, you see potential. Where others see the laws of physics, you see design challenges. Maybe you’ve built tech no one else could even sketch, battle suits, AI systems, adaptive weapons, contingency networks. Your genius isn’t just raw intelligence; it’s the ability to see ten steps ahead and build the tools you’ll need before the problem exists. You shine when pushing the boundaries of engineering, repurposing impossible tech, or building miracles under pressure.\n\n### Cinematic Skill Sets\n\n**Alien Scout**\n\nYou’ve got alien tech, training in advanced systems, and maybe a different understanding of physics altogether. This is great for intuitive tech roles, deciphering Earth customs, or finding unexpected solutions via off-world knowledge.\n\n**Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist**   \nYou were never the strongest, but you were always the smartest, the richest, or the most charming person in the room, and you weaponized that. You excel at resource coordination, high-society manipulation, press-facing spin, and turning favors into victories. Even now, the game is just played with fewer rules and sharper stakes.\n\n**Black Market Fixer**   \nIf someone wanted it pre-Z, you could get it. Now, you still can. You know what things are worth, how to negotiate, and who trades what. This set excels in scavenging, bartering, and recognizing what’s truly valuable.\n\n**Born to Wear the Mask**   \nYou grew up in legacy, tradition, and expectations. The costume wasn’t a calling; it was an inheritance. You were trained to inspire, to lead, and to represent something larger than yourself. You shine in public settings, with formal command, and when carrying the weight of a symbol.\n\n**Comic Book Archivist**\n\nPre-Z-Day, you were a mega-fan, deep in lore. And now? Well, it turns out comics got a lot right. You shine when referencing tropes, recognizing power types, or giving surprisingly good tactical advice based on superhero logic.\n\n**Conspiracy Theorist**\n\nSure, everyone laughed when you said the government was hiding zombies under Area 51, until Z-Day hit. Now your “crazy” theories might just be right. You shine in connecting bizarre dots, spouting fringe science, and improvising with weird, scavenged gear.\n\n**Ex-Supervillain Lackey**\n\nYou weren’t the big bad, but you were in the room. You carried gear, built death rays, and managed lairs. You know how the villain playbook works, and maybe you’re still playing it, just in a different way now.\n\n**Former Sidekick**\n\nYou were trained by a bigger name, someone famous. Maybe they’re gone, maybe they turned. Either way, you’ve inherited their habits and some of their training. You shine in action scenes and dramatic legacy moments.\n\n**Freelance Cryptid Hunter**\n\nBefore the world fell apart, you were chasing Bigfoot. Now you hunt even stranger things. This set helps in tracking, occult reasoning, and recognizing the signs of Supernatural weirdness before it kills you.\n\n**Gadgeteer Tinkerer**\n\nYou're not a full-on tech hero, but damn if duct tape and scavenged microchips don’t become something special in your hands. You shine when building gadgets under pressure or reverse-engineering enemy tech.\n\n**Hollow-Eyed Lab Tech**\n\nYou worked in a lab, maybe on superhumans, maybe on something darker. You shine in medical scenes, genetic theory, or when diagnosing just what the hell went wrong with that survivor’s blood sample.\n\n**Hunter of the In-Between**\n\nYou were trained to stalk what doesn’t want to be found. Whether beasts, criminals, or the supernatural, you know how to track, observe, and strike. You shine when patience matters more than firepower, and when others would already have lost the trail.\n\n**I’ve Seen Empires Rise and Fall**\n\nYou’ve watched the world change, slowly, brutally, beautifully. Whether you’re two hundred years old or just extremely well-read and widely traveled, your perspective gives you an edge. You shine when recognizing patterns, understanding cultures, and navigating crises with the calm of someone who’s seen worse.\n\n**Legacy Technician**   \nYou didn’t invent the tech, but you’ve inherited it, maintained it, and quietly improved it. Whether it was alien, magical, or just genius-level engineering, you’ve kept it functional. You excel in maintenance under pressure, repurposing powerful devices, and knowing just enough to avoid disaster.\n\n**Masked Detective**   \nYou’ve read the files, walked through the alleys, and followed the threads. You’re not just tough, you’re sharp. Ideal for investigation, intuition, and unraveling schemes before anyone else sees them.\n\n**Mystic Field Agent**   \nYou combine cold practicality with arcane insight. You’ve trained with sigils and firearms, read both alchemy and ops manuals. You’re not just a sorcerer, you’re a problem-solver with backup plans and backup weapons. You can read an omen and a room, then make both go quiet.\n\n**Mystical Chosen**   \nYou didn’t ask for your powers; they were bestowed. This set emphasizes intuition, fate-reading, and ritualistic traditions. You shine when interpreting omens, communicating with spirits, or invoking supernatural rules.\n\n**Parkour Courier**   \nWhen the streets were choked with traffic, checkpoints, or chaos, you ran. Rooftops, fire escapes, shattered overpasses, you turned the city into your track. You know how to move fast, fluid, and unnoticed. You shine when outrunning danger, navigating urban terrain, or slipping through tight zones without ever setting foot on the street.\n\n**Superhero Support Specialist**\n\nYou weren’t the one in the spotlight, but you were the reason they kept going. Butler, handler, medic, counselor, quartermaster, call it what you will. You brewed the coffee, stitched the wounds, maintained the gear, and talked them down after the worst nights. You understand routine, resilience, and the thousand little things that keep a hero alive and sane. You shine when managing logistics, treating trauma (physical or emotional), and delivering just the right words, or tools, at the exact moment they’re needed.\n\n**Super-Science Intern**   \nYou were never the lead genius, but you learned from the best. You’ve swept labs, dodged exploding prototypes, and watched brilliant minds work. Now you apply that half-learned brilliance on your own, with courage and duct tape.\n\n**Trained by the Old Ways**   \nYour knowledge doesn’t come from labs or manuals; it comes from scrolls, whispers, and rituals passed from one hand to another. You understand discipline, honor, and forces older than the Z plague. You shine in spiritual crises, mystical interference, and when modern tech fails.\n\n**Trained Since Childhood**   \nWhile other kids played, you practiced. Your guardians, harsh, strict, or distant, saw potential and molded it into precision. Now, your instincts are calibrated for combat, strategy, and survival under pressure. You don’t flinch. Don’t hesitate. You execute.\n\n**Wheelman**   \nYou used to be the guy behind the wheel, the one they trusted when things got hot. You know how to move a vehicle like it’s an extension of your body, how to escape a tail, and when to slam the brakes so the guy behind you eats dashboard. You shine in high-speed situations, vehicular escapes, or making an old junker dance like its factory new.\n","size_bytes":37630},"docs/2.3_Feats 5.3.md":{"content":"# **\\<H1\\>Feats**\n\n*It's not only power and passion that make us don the mask and capes. The Executioner, the Hood, and the Blue Dragon didn't have superpowers. They had natural abilities and specialized training, making them more than equal to those of us who relied on a flashy power or two.  \n*  \nIt’s not just powers that define a hero.\n\nThe Arch-lighting didn’t melt steel with his eyes. The Hood couldn’t fly. The Flashpoint never threw a punch that cracked concrete. But they stand toe-to-toe with Super-Zs, warlords, and worse, armed only with training, instinct, and capabilities forged in conflict.\n\nFeats represent the special talents and techniques either gained through specialized training or experience. They are not powers, they are muscle memory, applied insights, and good old-fashioned know-how.\n\nThe question is, are they enough?\n\n### \\<h3\\>Feats and Requirements\n\nYou will acquire a feat or two during character creation and later, as you advance in level, gain access to more.

Some combat maneuvers are attacks on their own, while others are combined with a regular attack. You may only perform a single maneuver at a time.\n\nAll Maneuvers share the following format. If an entry is missing in a particular write-up, it does not have that entry. For example, a Maneuver without a Requirement has no requirements.\n\n**Name (Type):** There are three types of maneuvers: Combat Maneuvers, Leadership Maneuvers, and Weapon Maneuvers.\n\n**Requirements:** Requirements necessary to learn to perform the maneuver.\n\n**Attack:** The Defense you are targeting with any modifiers to the attack roll.\n\nWhen attacking, use the appropriate power or skill bonus for the weapon/power you are attacking with.\n\nIn cases where more than one defense or passive skill DC is listed, the attack is performed against the highest DC unless otherwise noted.\n\nFor example*,* if the maneuver lists **Attack: Avoidance -3**, you make an attack roll with a -3 penalty against your target's Avoidance. While a maneuver lists Avoidance (Dexterity) for its attack, you would perform the appropriate Attack Roll; attack bonus + your Dexterity against your target's Avoidance, even if you were attempting a melee attack (which commonly uses Strength on attack rolls).\n\n**Action:** The Action required to perform the maneuver.\n\n**Range**: Range of attack (melee or ranged) and, if ranged, the number of areas the attack can reach and the possible number of targets; you can attack targets beyond a stated range with Disadvantage up to a maximum range of double the maneuver's base range.\n\n**Effect:** The maneuver's effect upon a successful attack. The first value is the maneuver's damage. Base means to roll damage normally for that attack. Alternately, maneuvers may add a modifier to the damage, for example, +1d6. In the case of a penalty, you deal a minimum of 1 point of damage. \"None\" means the maneuver deals no damage; this includes maneuvers combined with a normal attack. Unarmed Attacks count as kinetic damage unless otherwise noted.\n\n**Special:** If the maneuver has any additional effects, they will be listed here. This entry may be marked with additional tags, such as Special (Limitation) or Special (Additional Effect), for ease of reference.\n\n| Table X-X Maneuvers     |\n|-------------------------|\n| **Basic Maneuvers**     |\n| Charge                  |\n| Disarm                  |\n| Grab                    |\n| Grapple                 |\n| Team Attack             |\n| **Advanced Maneuvers**  |\n| Battlefield Command     |\n| Crushing Blow           |\n| Devastating Attack      |\n| Double Tap              |\n| Dual-Strikes            |\n| Earth Strike            |\n| Earth to Sky            |\n| Feint                   |\n| Flowing Sand            |\n| Guarded Attack          |\n| Guardian's Shield       |\n| Guns Akimbo             |\n| Headshot                |\n| Improved Team Attack    |\n| Inspiring Performance   |\n| Lure                    |\n| Murderous Precision     |\n| On my mark              |\n| Overwhelming Charge     |\n| Palm Throw              |\n| Quick Reflexes          |\n| Quick Strike            |\n| Rallying Cry            |\n| Rally the Troops        |\n| Rapid Strikes           |\n| Ricochet Throw          |\n| Shielding               |\n| Sholder Charge          |\n| Vicious Stab            |\n\n## \\<h2\\>Basic Maneuvers\n\nThe following are basic maneuvers everyone knows and has access to.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Charge\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Range**: Melee\n\n**Effect**: *Base*, add your Strength base die to the damage dealt upon a successful hit.

On a failure, the target drops the item you aim to disarm.  \n**Special:** If your target holds the item with two hands or possesses the Enhanced Strength origin feature, they gain Advantage on their strength saving throw.\n\n### \\<H3\\>Grab\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Range**: Melee\n\n**Effect**: The target of your grab must be no more than one size larger than you and within your reach. Using at least one free hand, if successful, the target is *grabbed* and cannot move; it can only attempt an escape, reverse, or attack you.  \n  \nIf your attack surpasses the target’s Avoidance by 5 or more, the target is *grappled* and *pinned* instead (see below)\n\nOnce grabbed or grappled, the target remains so until you release it, your target escapes, or external forces move them out of the grab or grapple.\n\nAdditionally, you can use this maneuver as a reaction and attempt to catch a friendly creature, stopping its movement.\n\n#### \\<H4\\>Grappling\n\nThe following grappling maneuvers require the target or the defender to be *grappled* or *grabbed*. Keep in mind that your opponent may gain the upper hand while grappling.\n\n-   **Escape:** To escape a grapple or break out of an opponent's grab, both you and your opponent must perform a face off, with the grappler utilizing strength and the one attempting to escape being able to use either Strength or Dexterity, with both being able to apply a skill set if applicable.\n-   **Pin:** To Pin your opponent, both of you must perform a face off, with the grappler utilizing strength and the one attempting to resist being able to use either Strength or Dexterity, with both being able to apply a skill set if applicable. If you are successful, the target is *Immobilized* and may only attempt to escape, reverse, or attack you with a regular attack (including powers). If you have the target pinned, as a bonus action, you may choose to automatically succeed on a challenge to escape the grapple.\n-   **Punish:** If an opponent is pinned, as an Action, you can punish them, automatically dealing damage as if they had been hit with your attack. You may only use an unarmed attack, power, or one-handed weapon.\n-   **Reverse:** You can attempt to reverse the grapple when grabbed or pinned. Both you and your opponent must perform a face-off. You may use either Strength or Dexterity while\n-   applying a skill set if applicable but do so at a Disadvantage. Your opponent meets the challenge using their Strength, applying a skill set if applicable. If successful, you can reverse the grab, or if pinned, you escape the pin and are now grappling with your opponent.\n-   **Moving a Grappled Creature**: When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature, but your space is halved (minimum of 1 area) unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Team Attack\n\n*Teamwork makes the dream work*\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance\n\n**Action:** Ready, triggered by an ally attacking a target you intend to attack.\n\n**Range:** Melee or Ranged (3 Areas)\n\n**Effect:** *Base;* Once your ally completes their attack, If the ally you chose successfully hit your intended target, you may then use your reaction to attack the same target, if you hit you combine your damage with that from your ally to determine if your attack deals *Massive Damage* (see massive damage pg xx)\n\n**Weapons:** You may perform this maneuver with any melee weapon, unarmed attack, or attack powers.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Shove\n\n**Attack:** Fortitude\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Range:** Melee\n\n**Effect:** If successful, you push the target back one area or knock them prone (your choice). Suppose this forced movement possesses the potential to deal damage to the target (such as pushing a zombie into a fire). In that case, your target must succeed in a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to your attack roll to move to another adjacent area of their choice or fall prone instead.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Advanced Maneuvers\n\nThe following is a list of Advanced Maneuvers that can be learned through acquiring the Learn Maneuver feat or as an advancement option for the Highly Trained Origin.\n\n### \\<h3\\>**Battlefield Command (Leadership)**\n\n**Requirements:** Charisma 13+  \n**Attack:** None  \n**Action:** Action  \n**Range:** 5 areas  \n**Effect:** Command an ally within range who can hear and see you.

The target does not move.\n\nIf you shield with your body, the target must be within your area; you take on the full results of the attack. If you are defeated, the target suffers any remaining damage (reduced by any applicable DR).\n\nIf you shield with an object, the target must be within your reach; the object takes on the full results of the attack. If the object is destroyed, the target suffers any remaining damage (reduced by any applicable DR).\n\nIf you shield with both your body and an object, the target must be within your area; the object first takes on the full results of the attack. If the object is destroyed, you suffer any remaining damage (reduced by applicable DR). If you are defeated, the target then suffers any remaining damage (reduced by the applicable DR).\n\nAt the editor-in-chief’s discretion, you may expend a plot point to use an object to shield a target up to a number of Areas away equal to your Rank.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Shoulder Charge (Combat)\n\n**Attack:** Fortitude\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Range**: Melee\n\n**Effect**: *Base*, on a hit, you can force your opponent into an adjacent area or knock them prone (your choice) after which you may move with your opponent into an adjacent area as a reaction.

On a failure, they move to another adjacent area of their choice or fall prone.\n\n**Special (Enhanced Strength)**: If you possess the Enhanced Strength Origins feature, you can send your target flying, throwing them a number of areas equal to half your Strength modifier. If they hit a solid object along their path, both they and the object suffer falling damage as if they fell the distance traveled.\n\n### \\<h3\\>**Vicious Stab (Combat)**\n\n**Requirements:** Dexterity 12+  \n**Attack:** Avoidance  \n**Action:** Action  \n**Range:** Melee  \n**Effect:** *Base,* on hit, you cause the target to bleed, dealing 1d4 damage at the start of their turn for the next 3 turns. This maneuver is ineffective against the undead; bleeding effects can stack with other instances of bleeding.\n\n**Weapons:** You may perform this maneuver with any melee weapon or unarmed attack that deals either slashing or piercing damage.\n","size_bytes":66086},"docs/2.4_Gear 3.2.md":{"content":"# **\\< H1\\>**GEAR\n\n# \\<h1\\>The Role of Gear\n\nThe role equipment plays in your game corresponds to the type of story you intend to tell.\n\nIn gritty games equipment may, at times, become more important than weapons. A water filtration kit may be worth far more than a trusty firearm; plastic bottles become highly sought after to store water after rainstorms, and basic medical equipment, and medications become as essential as food. In such gritty games, the Editor-in-Chief is encouraged to make the acquisition of necessary equipment a focal point, as items can draw the Heroes into danger and force them to take greater risks than they would normally. In gritty games, rumors of a boarded-up pharmacy or a gasoline truck trapped on an overpass on the other side of town become real motivators.\n\nIn a Campy game, equipment becomes much less important, and in all honesty should be more of an afterthought. The heroes always find what their enclave needs when they need it. The exploring of a new area becomes the focus, rather than the items salvaged. While locating some equipment can still be a big deal, the equipment is more substantial such as generators, solar panels, or a fully equipped ambulance with only one zombie in it!\n\n## \\<h2\\>Batteries\n\nThere is no escaping it; a lot of survival gear utilizes batteries. Many of these devices were never intended for extended survival conditions, and while there are several solar powered survival solutions (such as backpacks with built in solar panels to help recharge batteries), these devices are quite rare.\n\nSome players, especially ones playing Heroes with the *Engineering: (Electrical Engineering*) skill, will attempt to utilize small solar cells or create wind powered recharge stations. Just keep in mind that all batteries only have a limited number of recharge cycles and may give out at any time… usually when it’s least convenient.\n\n#### \\<Side Bar\\>\n\n### Complications with equipment\n\nEven in our real lives stuff sometimes seems to stop working when we need it most. A common trope in zombie movies is having your gun jam or the flashlight’s LED transformer finally gives out just when you need it most. Regardless of the type of game you are running, malfunctions can be used to heighten the tension of a scene. A flat tire can turn an easily handled situation into a matter of life and death.\n\nDon’t be afraid to use it.\n\n#### \\</Side Bar\\>\n\n## \\<h2\\>Acquisition Points\n\nDuring hero creation and through some feats, you may gain a number of acquisition points (AP) that you may spend to acquire equipment in this chapter.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Go-Bags\n\nAll heroes start with one of the following go-bags; items provided within these packs are commonly mismatched and pretty run down and can exhibit unexpected malfunctions at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion.

Guns, in particular, have become a blessing and a curse for many enclaves, though a reliable machete is worth five times its weight in military rations.\n\n## \\<h3\\>Attack Rolls\n\n*Ranged Weapon Attacks:* Using a Firearm, archaic missile weapons, and thrown weapon require a ranged attack roll where you use your dexterity bonus plus your rank to hit and add your dexterity bonus to damage.\n\n*Melee Weapon Attacks:* Using melee weapons requires a melee attack roll utilizing your strength or dexterity bonus plus your rank to hit, depending upon the weapon used.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Firearms & Archaic Missile Weapons\n\nFirearms and archaic missile weapons deal damage and possess qualities that work much like powers; an assault rifle, for example, might possess Energy Blast (Ballistic): 20. Thus, this weapon would deal 1d10 (ballistic) damage and have a base range of 5 areas. Additionally, some weapons may give access to unique firing modes that work, such as maneuver.\n\nFirearms have magazines or drums that allow for several shots before needing to be reloaded. But unlike most firearms, however, archaic missile weapons must be reloaded after every shot.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Tracking Ammunition\n\nAmmunition is not tracked in *Rotted Capes*, instead the scene after any hero uses a firearm or an archaic ranged weapon they are required to make an **Ammo Stress Test**, the player rolls a d6, on a roll of 1 they are out of the kind of ammo that weapon used. In *Rotted Capes* there are 5 kinds of ammunition *archaic, light, medium, heavy,* and *shells.*\n\nThe hero remains out of that kind of ammo until they use an ammunition restock or otherwise have a chance to acquire a new stash of ammo.\n\n**\\<h2\\> Restocking and Sharing Ammunition**\n\n*Restocking:* You may restock your carried ammunition in between scenes by accessing a stash, going back to the hotel, or through the use of a power like manifest gadgetry. With the time required to gather more ammunition may vary depending on the method used.\n\n*Sharing Ammo:* Heroes can give ammo to another hero with the same weapon type if they run out. But if they do, both will start without ammo in the next scene.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Weapon Qualities\n\n**AP:** This is the firearm’s cost in Acquisition Points. This cost is only paid when your Hero is acquiring an additional weapon. Weapons acquired as additional equipment have a single reload worth of ammunition.\n\n**Ammo:** Indicates the typical type of ammunition that a particular firearm was manufactured to fire (with L for Light, M for Medium, and so on).\n\n**Qualities:** *B:* Burst, *Dub:* Double Barrel, *R:* Extended Range*, P:* Penetrating, *S:* Silent, and *Sp:* Spray.\n\n*Burst (B):* You may use the *Burst* firing mode in fire modes the side bar.\n\n*Double Barrel (Dub):* You may fire one or both barrels in a single attack. If you fire both barrels, you roll double the ammunition’s damage die (this does NOT double your dexterity modifier damage bonus).\n\n*Extended Range (R):* Weapons with this quality suffer no penalties for attacking targets farther than 4 areas away, up to a maximum range of three times the weapons base range. If you use such a weapon to attack someone within 4 areas, you suffer disadvantage on your attack rolls.\n\n*Penetrating (P):* Weapons with this quality ignore 2 points of Damage Reduction\n\n*Silent (S):* Weapons do not make enough noise to alert nearby creatures of your presence.\n\n*Spray (Sp):* You may use the *Spray* firing mode in fire modes the side bar.\n\n**\\<side bar\\>**\n\n## \\<h2\\> Firing Modes\n\nFirearms have their own list of special maneuvers, referred to as firing modes. You cannot combine firing modes. For more on maneuvers, see pg XX. All Firing Mode penalties are cumulative, with penalties for attacking at range.\n\n| **Table X-X Firearm firing mode** |\n|-----------------------------------|\n| Burst Shot                        |\n| Full Auto – Single Target         |\n| Full Auto – Spray                 |\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Multiple Rounds and Armor/DR\n\nFiring Modes that fire multiple rounds (such as Full Auto and Double Tap) reduce each round's damage by DR. For example, if someone with a DR: 5 vs. ballistic damage is shot twice, each die’s damage is reduced by 5.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Burst\n\n*A typical three-round burst sacrifices accuracy for increased impact.*\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance -2\n\n**Action:** 1 Action\n\n**Range:** 3 areas\n\n**Effect:** Roll damage die three times, but only apply your dexterity modifier once.\n\n**Firearms:** Auto-Pistol, Assault Rifles, Machine Guns\n\n### \\<h3\\>Full Auto – Single Target\n\n*You unload a hail of bullets against a single target*\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance -2\n\n**Action:** 1 Action\n\n**Range:** As ammunition\n\n**Effect:** Roll a number of damage die equal to your Rank Bonus +4, but only apply your dexterity modifier once. At the end of this action, you are out of the type of carried ammunition used for this maneuver.\n\n**Firearms:** Auto-Pistol, Assault Rifles, Machine Guns.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Full Auto – Spray\n\n*You unload a hail of bullets against all the targets in a single area.*\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance -1\n\n**Action:** 1 Action\n\n**Range:** As ammunition\n\n**Effect:** Roll a single attack against the highest Avoidance target in a single area; if successful, you deal damage to all the targets in the area, friend and foe.\n\nYou may only affect a total number of targets equal to your Rank Bonus +4. At the end of this action, you are out of the type of carried ammunition used for this maneuver.\n\n**Firearms:** Auto-Pistol, Assault Rifles, Machine Guns.\n\n### \\</side bar\\>\n\n**Range:** The ammunition’s range in areas. You suffer disadvantage for firing at a target beyond this range; a firearm's maximum range is three times the weapon’s range. While Archaic Missile Weapons have a maximum range of double the weapon’s base range.\n\n**Damage:** Dice rolled for damage and type of damage dealt; you add your appropriate ability score modifier to your total damage rolled. weapons with a (b) deal ballistic damage while weapons with a (p) deal piercing damage.\n\n| Table X-X: Firearms & Archaic Range Weapons  |        |          |            |           |               |                                        |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|----------|------------|-----------|---------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Type**                                     | **AP** | **Ammo** | **Damage** | **Range** | **Qualities** | **Examples**                           |\n| **Handguns**                                 |        |          |            |           |               |                                        |\n| Auto-Pistol                                  | 2      | L        | 1d6 (b)    | 4         | Sp, B         | Glock 298, MP5K, UZI                   |\n| Revolver                                     | 1      | M        | 1d8 (b)    | 5         |               | S&W 968, Ruger Redhawk 45              |\n| Semi-Auto                                    | 2      | M        | 1d8 (b)    | 4         | B             | Glock,                                 |\n| Heavy Revolver                               | 2      | H        | 1d10 (b)   | 5         | P             | 357 Magnum, Colt Python                |\n| Heavy Semi-Auto                              | 4      | H        | 1d10 (b)   | 4         | B             | Desert Eagle, Taurus PT100 AFS         |\n| **Rifles**                                   |        |          |            |           |               |                                        |\n| Hunting                                      | 1      | H        | 2d6 (b)    | 10        | R             | K1-V-BBZ, Marlin 336XLR                |\n| Double Barrel                                | 2      | M        | 1d8 (b)    | 6         | Dub.          | H&H Double Role Side-by-Side           |\n| Sniper                                       | 4      | H        | 2d8 (b)    | 15        | R, P          | Dragunov, M82, M110                    |\n| Assault                                      | 3      | M        | 1d10 (b)   | 10        | Sp, B         | FAMAS, P90, TAR-21, AR-15, AK-47       |\n| **Machine Guns**                             |        |          |            |           |               |                                        |\n| Light                                        | 3      | M        | 1d8 (b)    | 8         | Sp, B         | M240, MG4                              |\n| Heavy                                        | 4      | H        | 1d10 (b)   | 8         | Sp, B         | XM370, Minigun                         |\n| **Shotguns**                                 |        |          |            |           |               |                                        |\n| Double Barrel                                | 2      | S        | 1d10 (b)   | 3         | Dub.          | Winchester Model 24                    |\n| Hunting/Tactical                             | 1      | S        | 1d10 (b)   | 4         |               | Benelli Nova, AT-14, Bullpup Saiga-12  |\n| Assault                                      | 3      | S        | 1d10 (b)   | 3         | Sp, B         | AA-12                                  |\n| **Archaic**                                  |        |          |            |           |               |                                        |\n| Bow / Crossbow                               | 1      | A        | 1d6 (p)    | 4         | S             | Reserve Bow, Long Bow, PSE Copperhead  |\n| Composite Bow                                | 2      | A        | 1d8 (p)    | 5         | S             | Bear Legion                            |\n\n### \\<h3\\>Melee Weapons\n\nMelee weapons are essential tools for survival, offering reliability and a personal touch in combat where firearms might fail or be unavailable. From the brute force of a heavy sledgehammer to the precision of a finely crafted katana. Melee weapons require no ammunition and can be improvised from everyday objects.\n\nAny time someone uses anything as a melee weapon, refer to the table below. If a specific weapon is not on the list, simply look for a comparable item and use the damage listed.\n\n**Melee Weapon Damage and Damage Types:**   \n Melee weapons deal their damage die plus your strength modifier or dexterity modifier, depending upon the weapon used. All common melee weapons deal with either kinetic, piercing, or slashing damage, which are covered under the melee damage type. Note that some weapons may be able to deal more than one damage type; a sword can slash as well as pierce effectively; such cases must be agreed upon by your editor-in-chief.\n\n**High Strength characters and melee weapons:**   \n There are times when a hero may want to use a melee weapon for additional effect, even if their base Strength damage die exceeds the damage dealt by the weapon. In these cases, using such a weapon effectively increases their Strength by +2, but the weapon breaks after use. For example, shattering a telephone pole upon a Super Z’s thick skull.\n\n| Table X-X Melee Weapon AP cost |             |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|\n| **Damage Die**                 | **Cost AP** |\n| 1d4 to 1d8                     | 1           |\n| 1d10 to 1d12                   | 2           |\n\n| Table X-X: Melee Weapons  |                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Damage Die**            | **Examples**                                                                                               |\n| Str.

For example, if you possessed 16 strengths, your unarmed attacks deal 1d8+3 kinetic damage. If you are wearing gauntlets or something more exotic like iron-laced hand wraps, your unarmed attacks deal +2 damage.\n\n**Hands Used/Required:** Weapons with d10 or higher damage require two hands to use effectively unless the creature is large or of greater size or is incredibly strong, at which point consult with your editor-in-chief. Weapons with damage of d8 or less may be used with both hands. You increase the damage type by 1 size, so a d8 becomes a d10.\n\n**Quick Weapons:** You may opt to use your dexterity to hit and damage if the weapon’s base damage die is d8 or lower and it deals slashing or piercing damage.\n\n| Table X-X: Other Weapons |        |\n|--------------------------|--------|\n| **Weapons**              | **AP** |\n| Grande Launcher          | 4      |\n| Flare gun                | 1      |\n| Flamethrower             | 4      |\n| Stun Gun/Taser           | 1      |\n| Molotov Cocktail         | 1      |\n| **Grenades**             |        |\n| - Fragmentation          | 2      |\n| - Flashbang              | 2      |\n| - Concussion             | 2      |\n| - Incendiary             | 2      |\n| - Tear-Gas               | 2      |\n| - Knock-Out Gas          | 2      |\n| - Poison Gas             | 2      |\n| - Smoke                  | 1      |\n\n# \\<h3\\>Other Modern Weapons\n\nUnlike firearms and archaic weapons, some weapons duplicate powers, and with their own Range which overrides the Base Power range.\n\n**Flare gun**\n\nA small, handheld device used to launch flares for signaling and illumination. It is commonly found in survival kits. Flare guns possess Energy Blast (Fire) 14, (d8 fire damage, 7 areas, shedding bright light in a 10-area range and dim light in a 10-area range beyond that until the end of your next turn. Anyone hit by a flare gun must make a Routine (DC:15) Dexterity saving throw or gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Fire* (see conditions pg xx). When fired into the sky, the flare can be seen as far as 5 miles away.\n\n**Flamethrower:**\n\nThis weapon projects a stream of flammable liquid, igniting anything in its path. Highly effective against clusters of enemies, flamethrowers possess Energy Blast (Fire) 24 (1d12 fire damage, range 6 areas) and can be fired 5 times before needing to be reloaded. Anyone hit by a flamethrower must make a Routine (DC:15) Dexterity saving throw or gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Fire)* (see conditions pg xx). While normal fuel can be used, it reduces the weapon’s effectiveness, lowering the Energy Blast (Fire) to 14 (d8 fire damage, range 3 areas).\n\n**Stun Gun/Taser:**\n\nThese non-lethal weapons are designed to incapacitate targets with an electric shock. Commonly used for self-defense and law enforcement, stun guns deliver an Energy Blast (Electrical) 24 (1d12 electrical damage/range of 1 area) shock. Creatures hit with a stun gun/taser must make a Routine (DC 15) Constitution saving throw or fall *Prone* and *Stunned (Lesser, Electrical)* until the end of their next turn.\n\n**Molotov Cocktail**\n\nThe easily created Molotov Cocktail has become quite common, becoming the most common use of loss of possible salvage once a fire goes totally out of control. All creatures within the affected area suffer an Energy Explosion (Fire): 20 blasts dealing 1d10 Fire damage. Targets within the area must make a successful Routine (DC: 15) Dexterity saving throw or gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Fire)* (see conditions pg xx).\n\n## \\<h3\\>Grenades\n\nGrenades come in two forms: as a round for a Grenade launcher or as a hand grenade. Hand Grenades are thrown weapons, while Grenade rounds commonly fired from a Grenade launcher.\n\nGrenades do not target a specific location but rather an area. When attacking with Grenades, the attacker needs only to succeed in an Easy (DC: 10) ranged attack roll. If the attack roll fails, the grenade lands in a Radom-adjacent area.   \n  \n**Grande Launcher:**\n\nThese shoulder-fired weapons launch grenades over a considerable distance. It is designed to provide explosive firepower with accuracy. These weapons may fire Concussion, Fragmentation, Incendiary, Tear-Gas, Knock-Out Gas, Poison Gas, or Smoke grenades at a 10-area range. **Grenade Launchers do not follow the general rule for ammunition. You must have a grenade round to launch it from a grenade launcher.**\n\n**Fragmentation Grande:**\n\nA standard military-grade explosive device designed to disperse shrapnel upon detonation, causing severe injuries over a wide area. All creatures within the affected area must make a dexterity saving throw (DC: 14) or suffer 1d6 Kinetic and 2d6 Piercing damage.\n\n**Flashbang Grande:**\n\nA non-lethal explosive device used to disorient and incapacitate enemies with a loud bang and blinding flash of light. All creatures within the affected area must make a successful Challenging (DC 20) Constitution saving throw or become *Blinded (Partial, Light)* + *Stunned (Lesser, Sonic)*. until the end of your next turn. This grenade does not affect zombies but will attract them.\n\n**Concussion Grande:**\n\nAn explosive device that delivers a powerful shockwave, knocking down and disorienting those within its blast radius. All creatures within the affected area suffer 2d8 Kinetic damage, forcing creatures in the area affected to make a successful Routine (DC: 15) consultation saving throw or be *Prone* + *Stunned (Lesser, Kinetic)* until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Corrosive Grande:**\n\nA grenade originally designed to melt doors and locks for breach maneuvers, some super villains and rogue nations developed these grenades into fully fledged anti-personnel weapons. All creatures within the affected area suffer 1d12 Acid damage and gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Acid, -2 Armor DR)* (see conditions pg xx).\n\n**Incendiary Grande:**\n\nA grenade that ignites upon explosion, spreading fire over the targeted area and causing severe burns. All creatures within the affected area suffer 1d12 Fire damage and gain *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed: Fire)*  \n(see conditions pg xx).\n\n**Tear-Gas Grande:**\n\nA non-lethal chemical weapon that disperses an irritating gas, causing temporary blindness and incapacitation. All creatures within the affected area must make a successful Challenging (DC 20) Constitution saving throw or become *Blinded (Partial, Irritant)* + *Weakened (Fortitude, Poison, Mild)* until the end of your next turn. This grenade has no effect on zombies.\n\n**Knock-Out Gas Grande:**\n\nA chemical weapon designed to release a gas that renders those within its radius unconscious. All creatures within the affected area must make a successful Routine (DC: 15) Constitution saving throw or fall *Unconscious (knocked out).* At the end of each turn, unconscious creatures make another saving throw, waking up upon a successful save or after 5 failed saves. This grenade has no effect on zombies.\n\n**Poison Gas Grande:**\n\nA lethal chemical weapon that disperses toxic gas, causing severe disorientation and physiological distress. All creatures within the affected area must make a successful Challenging (DC 20) Constitution saving throw or become *Weakened (Ability Scores, Poison)*. At the end of each turn, poisoned creatures make another saving throw. The condition ends upon a successful save or after 5 failed saves. This grenade has no effect on zombies.\n\n**Smoke Grande:**\n\nA small metal canister that releases a dense, acrid cloud of smoke upon activation. The area it affects becomes heavily obscured, making it nearly impossible to see through. Creatures within or attempting to see into or through the cloud have disadvantage on all vision-based checks and attack rolls. The smoke lingers until the end of the scene or until dispersed by strong wind or environmental effects. Perfect for covering retreats, confusing the enemy, or masking movement through dangerous ground.\n\n# \\<h1\\>Armor\n\nIn the harsh and unforgiving world where threats come from both the living and the undead, armor is an essential component of any survivor’s gear. While armor can limit mobility and be cumbersome, the added defense often makes the trade-off worthwhile, offering peace of mind in the chaotic and perilous post-Z-Day environment. Whether it’s a reinforced leather jacket, a riot shield, or a full tactical suit, the right armor can mean the difference between life and death.\n\n| Table X-X Armor              |             |\n|------------------------------|-------------|\n| **Body Armor**               | **Cost AP** |\n| Tactical Body Armor          | 3           |\n| Reinforced Clothing          | 1           |\n| Ballistic Vest               | 1           |\n| **Archaic/Makeshift Armor**  |             |\n| Boiled Leather Armor         | 2           |\n| Chain Mail                   | 3           |\n| Heavy Clothing               | 1           |\n| **Shields**                  |             |\n| Riot Shield                  | 2           |\n| Shield                       | 1           |\n\n## \\<h2\\> Using Armor\n\nWorn, non-power-based armor possesses two attributes: DR (Damage Reduction) and Bulk.\n\n*Damage Reduction* reduces the amount of damage suffered by its value. This reduction is applied before possible massive damage can be determined. For example, some armor provides protection against physical damage while offering protection against energy damage. *Damage Reduction* is further explained on page XX\n\n*Bulk* is a penalty to the wearer’s Avoidance defense and all Dexterity based skill checks.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Stacking Armor\n\nYou can wear different armor types. When you do, the highest Damage Resistance (DR) against a particular damage type prevails, but you suffer Bulk and Avoidance penalties for all armor worn.\n\n#### \\<h3\\>Modern Body Armor\n\nTactical body armor has come a long way over the last few years with some higher end companies utilizing Newtonian liquids/gels to stop high impact rounds while still allowing for a wide range of moment. Sadly, for survivors, zombies are not well known for their use of firearms.\n\n*Tactical Body Armor* (DR vs. Physical 3/Energy 2/Ballistic 6, Bulk: 1)\n\nCommonly used by the military and specialized law enforcement, tactical body armor consists of ballistic vests and reinforced clothing, including knee and elbow pads.\n\n*Reinforced Clothing* (DR vs. Physical 2/Energy 2, Bulk: 0)\n\nA very expensive form of body armor, reinforced clothing is made of Newtonian fibers. While it does not afford a lot of protection, it grants balanced protection against many attack forms. Before Z-Day hit, Reinforced Clothing had become the “go-to” armor among Heroes and Villains alike.\n\n*Ballistic Vest* (DR vs. Physical 1/ Ballistic 6, Bulk: 0)\n\nThis is your standard Kevlar vest, very good against ballistic attacks, but almost worthless against melee and energy attacks.\n\n#### \\<h3\\>Archaic/Makeshift Armor\n\nOver the last few years some people have attempted to recreate some older forms of body armor. While they afford protection against melee attacks, it is much harder to maneuver in them.\n\n*Chain Mail* (DR vs. Physical 4/Energy 1, Bulk: 2)\n\nA form of armor made from linked steel rings, some survivors have started to make this kind of armor from sniped coiled leather which they then link and solder together.\n\n*Boiled Leather Armor* (DR vs. Physical 3/Energy 0, Bulk: 1)\n\nUncommon to say the least, but some survivors turned to using boiled cow leather. These sets are molded to each individual, and although a set can be worn by anyone, they are increasingly uncomfortable to wear if not molded to you, granting an additional point of Bulk to anyone for whom they were not specifically made.\n\n*Heavy Clothing* (DR vs. Physical 2/Energy 0, Bulk: 0)\n\nAny attire that is either made of heavier material (such as a leather trench coat) or designed for sports protection (hockey/skating pads) can be worn with Ballistic Vests, in which case the higher ARs prevail. Wearing both imparts 1 points of bulk.\n\n#### \\<h2\\>Shields\n\nPreviously limited to riot control and as the chosen calling card of a few heroes, shields have come back into some use after Z-Day.\n\nShields gives you a +1 bonus for your avoidance additionally they allow some heroes to use the shielding maneuver (see maneuvers on page XX)\n\nRiot Shields are made of transparent reinforced Plexiglas, and though they are very handy, they are not as rugged as classic shields. Riot shields possess Material Strength of 12, and can take Hits: 2\n\nClassic shields are made of reinforced wood with a steel brace or are often simply made of steel; though they are heavy and a little ungainly, these shields are incredibly resilient. Classic Shields possess Material Strength of 20, and can take Hits: 6\n\nMakeshift shields utilize the material’s Material Strength (MS) and Hits as if they were only 1-inch-thick (see braking objects pg. xx); actual shields are reinforced and made to deflect damage and, as such, possess more hits than their material would afford.\n\n# \\<h1\\>Optics/Tactical Gear\n\nThe following is a list of common tactical gear. With the prevalence of tactical gear throughout the United States, there is a good chance Heroes may start out with such gear. In other countries where firearms are more controlled, these sought-after items may be a little harder to come by. While this list is nowhere near a complete list of possible tactical gear, the ones listed have tangible in-game effects. Of course, you can always add more to your game.\n\n| Table X-X Optics/Tactical Gear |             |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|\n| **Tactical Gun Accessories**   | **Cost AP** |\n| Tactical Rail system           | 1           |\n| Tactical Flashlight            | 1           |\n| Tactical Laser point sight     | 1           |\n| Silencer                       | 2           |\n| **Optics**                     |             |\n| Tactical Dot Sight             | 1           |\n| Standard Hunting Scope         | 1           |\n| Tactical Sniper Scope          | 2           |\n| Night Vision Sight             | 2           |\n| Night Vision Goggles           |             |\n|  *Simple Night Vision*         | 1           |\n|  *Tactical Night Vision*       | 2           |\n\n### \\<h3\\>Tactical Accessories and Sights\n\n*Tactical Rail System* - These systems can be added to any firearm, allowing for the mounting of a site, tactical flashlight, laser pointers, and so on. Being mounted on the firearm frees up the character’s other hand.\n\n*Tactical Flashlight* – Tactical Flashlights are small, powerful LED flashlights that can be mounted upon any firearm equipped with a tactical rail system. The batteries on these flashlights last for about 40 hours of continuous use. These lights provide directional bright light up to a range of two areas and shadowy light for an area beyond that.\n\n*Tactical Laser Point Sight* – These sights may be mounted upon any weapon with a tactical rail system. When used, they give the shooter a +1 bonus to hit when attacking any target within 3 areas. These Laser Sights produce a huge drain on their batteries and only last for a few hours of continuous use. Luckily, most point sights possess “trigger pads,” which allow them to be turned on right before firing at a target. Under such conditions, a set of batteries will last about 2 months of active, daily use.\n\n*Silencer* – This can be utilized on any firearm that fires light or medium ammo, but it will only last for a limited number of shots (about 100 rounds). Hearing a Silenced firearm requires a successful DC: 20 *Perception (Hearing)* skill check.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Firearm Sights\n\n*Tactical Dot Sight* – These sights may be mounted upon any weapon with a tactical rail system. When used, they give the shooter a +1 bonus to hit when attacking any target within 2 areas.\n\n*Standard Hunting Scope—These sights can be mounted on any rifle and do not require a tactical rail system. They* grant the weapon the *Extended Range* quality, up to a maximum of 10 areas.\n\n*Tactical Sniper Scope* *–* These sights can be mounted on weapons with a tactical rail system. These scopes grant the weapon the *Extended Range* quality up to a maximum of 20 areas.\n\n*Night Vision Sight –* These sights can be mounted on weapons with a tactical rail system. These scopes grant the weapon the *Extended Range* quality up to a maximum of 10 areas. Unlike the scopes above, Night Vision Sights grant the user the ability to fire at night as if they possessed Super Sense (Night Vision): 20 (+5). This option can be used for 3 continuous hours before requiring a recharge.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Night Vision Goggles\n\n*Simple Night Vision Goggles:*  These goggles, commonly found as toys, are the most basic level of night vision available. These Goggles grant their wearer Super Sense (Night Vision): 14 (+2) for 8 hours’ worth of continuous use.\n\n*Tactical Night Vision Goggles:*  Modern military spec goggles, these goggles grant their wearer Super Sense (Night Vision): 20 (+5) for 12 hours’ worth of continuous use.\n\n# \\<h2\\>Equipment\n\n| Table X-X: Equipment                  |             |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|\n| **Item**                              | **Cost AP** |\n| **First Aid Kits**                    |             |\n| Standard first aid kit                | 1           |\n| EMT Medical Field Kit                 | 2           |\n| Tactical Response Pack                | 3           |\n| Full Medical Response Pack            | 4           |\n| **Other Equipment**                   |             |\n| Backpack                              | 1           |\n| Batteryless “shake” Flashlight\\*      | 2           |\n| Binoculars                            | 1           |\n| Binoculars (Night Vision)             | 2           |\n| Bivouac Sack (1 man tent)             | 1           |\n| Canteen                               | 1           |\n| Climbing Kit                          | 1           |\n| Compass                               | 1           |\n| Duct Tape                             | 1           |\n| Field Kit                             | 1           |\n| Fire Extinguisher                     | 1           |\n| Firearm Maintenance Kit               | 1           |\n| Flashlight\\*                          | 1           |\n| Flint and striker                     | 1           |\n| Gas Mask\\*                            | 2           |\n| Grappling hook                        | 1           |\n| Hand held GPS, Civilian               | 2           |\n| Hand held GPS, Military               | 3           |\n| Handsets, 2-Way Radio,  Walkie-Talkie | 1           |\n| Lantern – Solar, Battery, Gas\\*       | 1           |\n| Lock Picks                            | 1           |\n| Maps                                  | 1           |\n| Multi-Tool                            | 1           |\n| Rope (Hemp) 30’                       | 1           |\n| Rope (Kevlar) 30’                     | 2           |\n| Rope (Nylon) 30’                      | 3           |\n| Rucksack                              | 1           |\n| Sleeping Bag                          | 1           |\n| Solar/Crank radio                     | 2           |\n| Tent                                  | 1           |\n| Tool Kit, Partial                     | 1           |\n| Tool Kit, Complete                    | 2           |\n| Water Filtration Kit                  | 1           |\n\nHere is a list of common equipment; some of these items have actual game mechanics, as described below.\n\nThis is not a complete list of gear and goods. Feel free to browse through camping gear catalogs, sportsmen, survival, and tactical gear websites. With the permission of your Editor-in-Chief, you may acquire such gear during Hero creation.\n\n### \\<h3\\>First Aid Kits\n\nMedical Kits come in several sizes, from small standard-sized medical kits to backpack-sized advanced medical packs. While some kits simply have more supplies than others, we suggest that you shy away from the minutia of tracking every bandage and every dose of antibiotic. Though we give these kits a static bonus for specific skills, the current state of these packages and when they run low is within the preview of the editor-in-chief. Unless they check regularly, Heroes may very well be caught by surprise when one or two supplies suddenly run out.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief should treat first aid kits much like character flaws; at any time, the Editor-in-Chief may declare that the first aid kit is short of one or more needed pieces of equipment or essential medication. The players may accept the result and play through it, gaining a Plot Point, or counter it by spending a Plot Point. Regardless, once the editor-in-chief declares that a first aid kit is starting to run low, the heroes had better start looking to refill their stockpiles.\n\n*Building a Medical Kit –* Heroes can use out-of-frame activities to restock existing medical kits; see page XX for out-of-frame activities.\n\n*Standard first aid kit* – These are the standard first aid kits found in most homes and the trunks of high-end cars and occasional jeep. While this kit does not grant a bonus to a Hero’s *Medicine* Skill Checks, it is considered to be the right tool for the right job and, as such, negates any relevant penalties.\n\n*EMT Medical Field Kit* – A larger kit, commonly carried in a modified tool/tackle box, these kits come with a large variety of bandages, pain relievers, antibiotic packages, instant ice packs, and some basic surgical tools. Any Hero utilizing this kit gains a +2 bonus to all *Medicine* Skill Checks. If a Hero is being treated for a disease or attempting to recover Wounds while being treated with this kit, they gain a +1 bonus to their Constitution Ability Checks.\n\n*Tactical Response Pack* – Standard military backpack. These kits are highly sought after, packed with everything found in the *EMT Medical Field Kit* (just more of it) as well as Ammonia inhalants, liquid bandages, trauma dressings, and emergency surgical tools. Any Hero utilizing this kit gains a +3 bonus to all *Medicine* Skill Checks. If a Hero is being treated for a disease or attempting to recover Wounds while being treated with this kit, they gain a +2 bonus to their Constitution Ability Checks.\n\n*Full Medical Response Pack* – Also known as a portable hospital, these packs are extremely rare, limited to military, police, emergency response units, and the occasional survival nut. These packs come with everything found in both the *Tactical Response Pack* and *EMT Medical Field kits* (just more of it), as well as CPR Masks, blood pressure kits, cervical collars, blood clotting spray, burn spray, and so on. Mere rumors of small stockpiles of these packs have led more than one Hero to their deaths. Any Hero utilizing this kit gains a +5 bonus to all *Medicine* Skill Checks. If a Hero is being treated for disease or attempting to recover Wounds while being treated with this kit they gain a +3 bonus to their Constitution Ability Checks.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Other Equipment\n\n**Backpack**\n\nComing in various sizes and styles backpacks can commonly hold about 10 items of regular gear comfortably, while a tactical backpack with a molle system can store 14 items.\n\n**Batteryless “Shake” Flashlight**\n\nThese provide light for 3 rounds, requiring an action to charge it. These flashlights provide 2 areas of directional bright light and 2 areas of shadowy light beyond that.\n\n**Binoculars**\n\nBinoculars grant the user the equivalent of Super Sense (Telescopic Vision): 26 (+8) and require both hands to use properly.\n\n**Binoculars, Night Vision**\n\nThis works just like standard Binoculars, but they also grant the user Super Sense (Night Vision): 26 (+8) as well. Night vision requires 6 AA batteries lasting for 6 hours of continuous use.\n\n**Climbing Kit**\n\nThese kits consist of hammer, pitons, and hooks, granting the user a +2 bonus to all Athletics: (Climbing) checks.\n\n**Duct Tape**\n\nPerhaps the most useful piece of equipment, new, sealed rolls of Duct tape are highly sought after. Duct Tape possesses an effective Strength: 14 (+2) when used to tape things up.\n\n**Fire Extinguisher**\n\nFire Extinguishers require two consecutive Demanding actions to use, snuffing out fire in a single area. After emptied, an Extinguisher is worthless, except possibly as a club.\n\n**Firearm Maintenance Kit**\n\nThis kit grants a Hero a +2 bonus on all *Engineering/Firearms* Skill Checks when attempting to repair a jammed firearm.\n\n**Flashlight**\n\nThese LED flashlights provide about 60 hours of continues life on a set of new batteries. They provide 2 areas of directional bright light and 2 area of shadowy light beyond that.\n\n**Gas Mask**\n\nGas Masks provide the wearer with Life Support: 20 (+5), but only against gas attacks. These masks have filters which need to be cleaned out after every use.\n\n**Hand Held GPS  \n**Many of the GPS satellites continue to work though many of them have already begun to drift off their orbit. A common GPS can assist someone within 10 areas of their intended location. Military grade GPS’s are still very accurate. They may be used to navigate to within 1 area of any location on the planet.\n\n**Handsets/2-Way Radios/** **Walkie-Talkie**\n\nPossessing a battery life of 5 hours and an effective range of 1 mile, these radios have become quite effective, though their reliance on batteries limits their usefulness.\n\n**Lantern – Solar, Battery, Gas**\n\nSolar and battery lanterns only require a Simple action to turn on, while Gas powered lanterns require two Demanding actions and a source of fire (such as matches). Lanterns provide bright light to the area they are in and 2 areas of shadowy light to adjacent areas.\n\n**Lock Picks**\n\nThese picks grant you a +2 bonus on challenges to open mechanical locks if you possess an appropriate skill set.\n\n**Maps**\n\nA good map and a compass are all you need to navigate to any location on the map. Very detailed maps might give you advantage on appropriate challenge rolls when you possess an appropriate skill set.\n\n**Multi-Tool**\n\nA good multi-tool is worth its weight in gold and is commonly qualifies as having right tool for the job (see skills)\n\n**Rope/Rope (Nylon) 30’/ Rope (Kevlar) 30’/ ½” thick**\n\nStandard rope has an effective Strength of 16(+3), nylon rope has an effective strength of 20 (+4), and Kevlar has an effective Strength of 22 (+6).\n\n**Solar/Crank radio**\n\nThese radios have a range of 10 miles but rarely pick up any signals.\n\n**Tool Kits**\n\nPartial tool kits commonly qualify as having right tool for the job (see skills) while a Complete tool kits would also grant you a +2 bonus on all rolls to meet a challenge were your tools would be useful.\n\n**Water Resistant Items**\n\nAny “Water Resistant Item” allows the item in question to work in wet conditions, even allowing it to be submerged in 60 feet of water.\n\n# \\<h1\\>Vehicles\n\nAbandoned vehicles now crowd every street and almost every major highway. Helicopters lie dormant in airports, and ships drift the seas filled with the walking dead.\n\nDepending upon the enclave and location, heroes may require the use of vehicles, be it for scouting or clearing out areas for scavenging. Most of the time, such vehicles will simply become backdrops, providing the heroes with a way to get between here and there, but there will be times when those very same vehicles can become godsends or lead to the heroes’ doom.\n\nAll vehicles have the following qualities: refer to individual vehicle descriptions for any additional rules.\n\n**Handling**\n\nThis is an adjustment to the Hero’s Drive/Pilot Skill Checks. Such roles are only required when the driver/pilot is attempting a difficult maneuver (See Vehicle and Mounts, pg. XX).\n\n**Speed**\n\nThese numbers represent the vehicle's speed ranks to determine acceleration and top speed, respectively. During combat, this translates directly to a number of areas of movement. So, a vehicle with 3/10 would have an acceleration speed of 3 areas and a top speed of 10 areas. Acceleration rate is how quickly the vehicle gains speed; with each turn, the vehicle can increase its speed by the stated amount until it reaches maximum speed. The car described above would require 4 turns of acceleration to reach top speed.\n\nA ground and sea vehicle’s deceleration value (stopping power) is one-half their maximum speed, though the driver can always attempt to bring the vehicle to a complete stop as a Demanding action with a successful Challenging (DC: 20) Challenge. Flying vehicles are a different matter; except for VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) aircraft, such as helicopters, flying vehicles cannot stop moving until they land. Even then, all such aircraft require a landing strip distance equal to one half their maximum speed. Aircraft all possess a maneuverability rating (C) Clumsy, (A) Agile, and (P) Perfect.\n\nIf a speed is shown as +X, that speed is added to the Heroes’ Pace, with the Heroes’ Pace being that vehicle’s acceleration value.\n\n**MS/Hits**\n\nDenotes the Material Strength and the Hits the vehicle can absorb before ceasing to function. Each hit taken also applies a -1 penalty to the driver’s rolls to meet any driving challenge.\n\n**Pass**\n\nNumber of passengers that may safely ride in the vehicle.\n\n**Size**\n\nSome vehicles may take up more than one area (such as Tractor Trailers) but the majority of them are still only considered one area in size.\n\n**AP values and the lack there of**\n\nYou might notice that vehicles lack a AP cost, this is on purpose, vehicles are meant to be something found and maintained by your enclave, the editor may allow players who have the ability to “find” gear when you need it to find a working vehicle if the situation warrants it. Of course, there is always the use of plot points to alter the scene to find such a useful vehicle.\n\n| Table X-X: Land Vehicle Statistics |              |          |             |          |

You might *think* you have a full tank of gas but sometimes gas gauges give false readings, or maybe there was some water in that fuel, or maybe the fuel pump broke, leaking that fuel all over the road.\n\nThe editor can use this to start the heroes down a new story arc, to add tension, or simply to spice an encounter up. As such, rules for exact ranges and fuel consumption are completely unnecessary.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Editor’s Note: **On the subject of Fuel**\n\nGasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, once the lifeblood of vehicles and machines, have become precious commodities. It's been 2-4 years since Z-day struck, and as a result, gasoline reserves have been depleted, leaving the survivors with limited options for conventional fuel sources.\n\nIt’s up to you, the Editor-in-Chief, to decide how fuel scarcity impacts the campaign. If you choose, you can hand-wave fuel availability, allowing the heroes to find miraculously untouched gas stations with full tanks of fuel. This approach keeps the focus on other aspects of the game while sparing players the logistical headaches of tracking fuel reserves.\n\nNote that this setting also offers a solution, super tech that powers vehicles through alternative means or retrofitting vehicles to run on unconventional hydrocarbons. This opens up some interesting sub-plots or even entire storylines, as heros may need to hunt down or protect specialized technology.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n","size_bytes":56103},"docs/2.5_Ability and

probably noticed that the Master Values table has a few data points. Strength based data points are self-explanatory, with some handy examples of what a character with a particular Strength is able to lift.\n\n#### \\<h3\\>**Throw** Range\n\nThrow Range is the number of areas an object of maximum weight can be thrown. Lighter objects can be thrown a number of additional areas equal to the difference between the Hero’s throw range and the weight of the object. For example, someone with 48 Strength tossing a 6-ton school bus would be able to throw that bus a total of 16 areas (48 Strength has a range of 14 areas, while a school bus would fall within 34 Strength, a 2-area difference).\n\n\\<h3\\>**Speed Data Point**\n\nTop MPH, is the top speed of a character while out of combat. In combat, characters are limited to their speed value in areas. For example, someone with a Speed of 28 would have a top speed of 90 mph, but in combat would be limited to 9 areas of movement.\n\n| **Table X-X: Attribute Potential** |                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Score Example                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 1-6                                | Feeble.

Crushing Z heads, fighting off marauders, fixing that finicky generator, or finding a stash of antibiotics, the more you do it, the better you get at it. Maybe you’ll sharpen your skills as you expand your skill set. Maybe you finally get that new gadget to work, or put the time in to mastering your powers, or even discover new ones along the way. Or maybe you put the work in to improve your physicality or sharpen your mind.\n\nBefore Z-Day, governments classified heroes and villains. They used a system similar to storm categories, assigning numerical values from Category I for the weakest to Category V for the most powerful, with Category X for cosmic-level threats. In the online space, scores of vloggers, many self-proclaimed superpower experts, poured over hours and hours of footage to develop power rankings. Ranking heroes using Greek alphabetical letters, ranging powered individuals from Delta for the weakest to Omega for the most powerful of earth’s individuals. But it was one naming convention that grew out of the classic media, enduring even in alternate media space before Z day, one splitting heroes and villains alike into A-Listers and Prime-Listers, the big names, the ones to watch, and the B-Lister, the forgettable street-level heroes and villains or plucky sidekicks.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Leveling in Rotted Capes\n\nAfter completing an issue, your editor-in-chief will commonly award you a level increase. Once you reach the 10th level, your next level sets you at level 1 of the next rank. For Example, as an Epsilon (Rank 1) hero, once you finish your 11th issue, you become a level 1 Rank 2 (Delta) hero.\n\n**\\<SIDE BAR\\>**\n\n### \\<h3\\> Beyond rank 6: Omega Level Heroes\n\nOmega-level heroes and threats represent the pinnacle of power, possessing cosmic-level abilities that far surpass the capabilities of ordinary heroes. These beings, often referred to as Omaga-level heroes, wield such immense power that they exist beyond the scope of typical gameplay in Rotted Capes. While the game system is designed with limits to maintain balance, it theoretically allows for conscious extrapolation beyond Rank 7, enabling the imagination of powers and threats of even greater magnitude.\n\n**\\</SIDE BAR\\>**\n\n| **Table X-X  Hero Advancement Table** |                         |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Level**                             | **Improvement**         |\n| 1                                     | Creation/Rank Increase  |\n| 2                                     | Power Boost             |\n| 3                                     | Feat                    |\n| 4                                     | Feature                 |\n| 5                                     | Power Boost             |\n| 6                                     | Feat                    |\n| 7                                     | Feature                 |\n| 8                                     | Power Boost             |\n| 9                                     | Feat                    |\n| 10                                    | Feature                 |\n\n| **Table X-X Hero Ranks & Rank Cap** |              |                     |          |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------|\n| **Rank**                            | **Rank Cap** | **Categorization**  |          |\n| 1                                   | 20           | Zeta                | B-Lister |\n| 2                                   | 24           | Epsilon\\*           |          |\n| 3                                   | 28           | Delta               |          |\n| 4                                   | 32           | Gamma               | A-Lister |\n| 5                                   | 36           | Beta                |          |\n| 6                                   | 40           | Alpha               |          |\n| 7                                   | 44           | Theta               | Ultra    |\n| 8                                   | 47           | Sigma               |          |\n| 9                                   | 50           | Upsilon             |          |\n| 10                                  | 50           | Omega               |          |\n\nNote: Heroes start as Level 1 – Epsilon Rank heroes\n\n## \\<h2\\> Leveling Features\n\nAs you gain levels, you may choose one of the following options at each level.  \nAny increase to an ability or power score beyond your current Rank Cap is considered untapped potential and does not apply until you advance to a higher Rank.\n\n-   **Rank Increase:** Increase your rank by +1. This raises your Rank Cap by 5, your Rank Bonus, and Grit by +1.\n-   **Feat:** Choose Feat\n-   **Feature:** Choose an Origin Feature\n-   **Power Boost:** Increase all your power scores by +1.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Rank Cap: Ability and Power Score Caps\n\nA hero or threat cannot have an ability score or power score higher than their rank cap, as shown on **Table X-X Hero Ranks & Rank Cap**; this includes bonuses from powers and power modifications.\n\nAbility and Power Score’s final score exceeds this cap; it is capped at this maximum. Any points above the cap are considered untapped potential. As you increase in rank, you can utilize the power’s score up to the new rank cap.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Campaign Cap\n\nThe editor-in-chief may set a rank cap for the campaign; once you reach this cap, you simply no longer level. Most campaigns are capped at rank 4 Gamma (A-Listers), but again, your editor-in-chief may opt for a higher cap. Keep in mind that Highly Trained heroes will have a hard time increasing beyond rank 4; you can always give these heroes an additional Origin, allowing them to develop new abilities beyond those of a Highly Trained hero.\n\n**\\<side bar\\>**\n\n### \\<h3\\> Optional Rule: Retcon\n\nRotted Capes has a lot of character options, so much so that it’s very easy for a player to create a hero they are just not happy playing. For this, we have the Retcon rule: any time before the hero hits Epsilon level 9, they can change their character’s ability scores and powers by going back to those steps of hero creation and then applying any leveling features they may have gained. Don’t allow this if someone is attempting to game the system; the retcon is meant to be a safety net for new players.\n\n**\\</side bar\\>**\n\n### \\<h3\\> Optional Rule: Starting at a higher level.\n\nIf you want to start your campaign at a higher rank, have your players create their heroes as usual.

The vast majority of us have a power or two that gives us the confidence to put on a mask and fight crime. Powers are what bystanders think of when they say “superhero,” and sometimes, all that stands between being alive and being zombie chow is a power.\n\n‘Course, our powers aren’t all accidents of birth or augmentation. The Crimson Sorceress claimed her powers were magical, while GearJack built his powers from junk at a scrap yard. The Bengal Tiger once told me his Martial Arts were fueled with mystic energy. None of that mattered to the zombies, of course; they Z’d all three of them just the same.\n\n# \\<h2\\>Power Checks\n\nSometimes, you will be required to make a Power Check when attempting to utilize a power. When a power check is called for, roll a d20 + your powers modifier + its primary ability score modifier. Not all powers utilize power checks; some powers may have different uses, requiring skill checks or utilizing a different ability score.\n\n#### \\<h3\\>Saving Throws and Passive Power DC\n\nSome powers will refer to a passive power DC calculated like a passive skill DC, 10 + Primary Ability Score Modifier + Power Score Modifier. Any time a power calls for a saving throw, it is against the power’s passive power DC.\n\n#### \\<h3\\>Power Score Data Points\n\nLike ability scores, powers share the same table to determine their effects. Refer to the Ability/Power Score Table on pg. XX and Appendix XX.\n\nFor example, someone with a Strength of 20 would have a +5 to hit and damage in melee and be able to throw an object 7 areas, whereas a hero with Energy Blast of 20 would have a +5 bonus to hit, a base damage die of d10, and a range of 10 areas.\n\nThe chart covers the basics for many powers; if the Power Description provides an alternative benefit for Power Scores, it supersedes the general progression outlined.\n\n#### \\<h3\\>Holding Back\n\nHeroes and villains are not always required to use their full power. You may choose to “pull your punch” and use power at a lower power score; when you do so, you still use your total power score when making any power check, but you can do less damage or reduce the number of areas affected by a power.\n\n# \\<h2\\>Power Descriptions and Signatures\n\nMany powers described herein have deliberately vague flavor text to allow you, the player, to craft your Hero’s signature look. Some powers (Speed, for example) allow for some creative flexibility. Whereas one hero may slide on sheets of Ice she produces in front of him; another hero may be the classic speedster.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that every Hero and villain possesses a particular “power signature,” which is a specific look their power has when used. Two fire manipulators can have two very different manifestations. One may throw balls of flame at his targets, while the other, surrounded by flames, might direct her flames to strike out in quick whips against her opponents.\n\n\\<Sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Energy Types and Targeted Defense\n\nMany powers require you to key them to a particular type of energy; this not only dictates the damage type, but the defense attacked (see table below)\n\n| Energy Type | Description                                                                                                                | Defense Attacked |\n|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Acid        | A corrosive substance that eats away at targets, causing melting or disintegration                                         | Avoidance        |\n| Cold        | Extreme cold or ice-based attacks that freeze or slow down targets.                                                        | Avoidance        |\n| Cosmic      | The boundless energy of the universe itself, power that manipulates reality, space, and time.                              | Avoidance        |\n| Electricity | Electric shocks or discharges that deliver high-voltage damage to targets                                                  | Avoidance        |\n| Fire        | Flames and intense heat that burn and scorch targets.                                                                      | Avoidance        |\n| Kinetic     | Physical impact or force-based attacks that rely on sheer momentum or concussive blows.                                    | Avoidance        |\n| Light       | Refers to attacks that harness the power of intense light to harm or hinder targets.                                       | Avoidance        |\n| Radioactive | Ionizing radiation, which melts objects, burns flesh, and causes cellular damage or radiation sickness.                    | Avoidance        |\n| Sonic       | Sound-based attacks that utilize powerful vibrations or shockwaves to damage targets.                                      | Fortitude        |\n| Psychic     | Psychic damage is a form of mental assault that affects the target's mind, causing pain, confusion, or emotional distress. | Willpower        |\n\nFeel free to create new energy types, but be warned: if the selection is too exotic, some powers will become too powerful while others might become useless.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Power Sources and Effects\n\nPowers come from various sources, and it is up to you to determine the source of your powers, which is usually shaped by your origin and power modifications given to each power. For example, your Energy Blast power could result from mutated ocular blasts or a blaster pistol.\n\nWhile each Hero possesses a power source, all Hero’s powers are not required to be part and parcel of that source.\n\n## Power Modifications\n\nAs fully explained at the end of this section, Power Modifications alter how powers function and are utilized or accessed. These modifiers are applied once you have purchased your starting powers. Power modifications increase or decrease your power score.\n\n## Power Stunts\n\nWhen you use a power often enough, you master its use in unique ways. Kind of like how Basilisk can ricochet his energy beam off walls to hit targets at crazy angles or how Flair can shift the power of her energy sheath into a front-heavy shield, and don’t forget Cat5 how they had such control over their wind powers that they were able to lift and move small objects with ease.\n\nThere are two types of Power Stunts: *Emulated Powers* and *Power Tricks.*\n\n### \\<h3\\>Emulated Powers\n\nSome powers have a list of emulated powers, which are other powers you can duplicate using that power. Emulated powers use the parent power’s primary attribute and have a power score 6 points lower than the parent power. Additionally, emulated powers inherit all of the parent power’s modifications. You cannot, however, use an emulated power to emulate other powers.\n\nYou can always propose new emulated powers, which your Editor-in-chief must approve.\n\nFor instance, you may possess Move Object 20 and later learn to emulate Energy Blast (Kinetic), which you would have at a Power Score of 14.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Power Tricks\n\nPower tricks are innovative ways to use existing powers. Energy beams ricocheting off a wall, using an energy blast on all the targets in an area, or increasing the chance of a knockback at the cost of accuracy or damage are just a few examples.\n\nPower Tricks grant advantages or additional effects in exchange for increasing the power’s burnout value, suffering Disadvantage, requiring multiple actions, or applying penalties to hit or damage.\n\nWhen you wish to perform a new Power Trick, you must first describe it to your editor-in-chief, who then decides if it is possible, what its effects are, what burnout costs are, and what any other modifications are required.\n\nWe have created and presented a few in the sidebars, among the powers section below.\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\nA Quick guide to understanding Power Tricks\n\n*Powers:* The powers that may perform this power trick.\n\n*Cost:* list of penalties that apply to the power trick.\n\n*Effect:* The effect of using the power trick.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Developing and Mastering Power Stunts\n\nWhen attempting to develop a new power stunt, you are limited to using that power stunt once per scene at the cost of a plot point. When developing a new power stunt, the editor-in-chief may require a power check to perform it successfully; if such a roll is required, you are only required to spend a plot point if the roll is successful.\n\nOnce you have performed a particular Power Stunt 10 times, the next time you gain a feat, you may take the *Master Power Stunt* Feat to master it, allowing you to use that stunt as many times as you wish without the expenditure of a plot point.\n\nOnce you have mastered an Emulated Power, you may later separate an emulated power from its parent power by using the *Master Emulated Power* feat, making it a separate power that can now be increased independently with all the parent power’s modifications.\n\nExample: You possess Move Object:20 and Master the Emulated Power of Energy Blast (Kinetic): 14. Later, you can take the *Master Emulated Power* feat and choose to separate Energy Blast (Kinetic), making it an independent power.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Understanding Powers\n\nPowers are presented in a universal format with entries as listed below. If a power lacks a particular entry, it simply does not apply.\n\n## \\<Power Name\\>\n\n**Characteristics:** Continuous, Damaging, Interruptible, Melee, Ranged, Scene\n\n**Primary Ability:**\n\n**Action:**\n\n**Attack:**\n\n**Burnout:**\n\n*\\<Descriptive flavor text\\>*\n\n**Effect:**\n\n### Characteristics:\n\nBelow is a list of possible characteristics. Sometimes, possible limitations, such as Super-Human Only, may also be included*.*\n\n*Continuous:* This power is continuous and does not require activation.\n\n*Damaging:*  Powers with this characteristic deal your power’s base power die + the power score modifier in damage as indicated by your power score.\n\n*Interruptible:* This use of this power is considered an *Interruptible* action *(*See pg. XX).\n\n*Ranged:* Any power with this characteristic is utilized at range. Unless a static number of areas is noted (with 0 being the same area), a ranged power’s range is equal to your power score modifier (minimum of 2) in areas. Also, unless otherwise noted, you must have a direct line of sight to your intended target.\n\n*Melee:* A power with the *Melee* characteristic may only be used against targets in the same area.\n\n*Scene:*  Once this power is activated, it lasts until the end of the Scene. Powers with this duration may be shut off at the hero’s discretion before the end of the scene as a bonus action on their turn.\n\n### Primary Ability:\n\nAll powers possess a Primary Ability, which is utilized when you are required to perform a Power Check. If two ability scores are listed, upon acquiring the power, you must pick one; once chosen, you cannot change the power’s Primary Ability.\n\n### Action:\n\nThe action required to utilize this power.\n\n### Attack:\n\nThe Defense targeted by the power; any attack that attacks the target’s Avoidance requires either the *Ranged* or *Melee* attack roll. Powers that attack the target’s Fortitude or Discipline require a *Power* attack roll.\n\n### Burnout:\n\nThe continued use of certain powers can cause stress and fatigue, leading to the phenomenon known as *burnout*.\n\nAs you use your powers, you must keep track of your burnout score. Your total accumulated burnout is reduced by your rank bonus each time you complete a turn without using powers with a burnout cost.\n\nHowever, any time you start your turn with an accumulated Burnout above your Burnout Threshold, you must make a Burnout check by rolling a d20. You must succeed or find that you can’t use any of your power’s burnout value for the remainder of the scene.\n\nThe DC of your Burnout Check starts at a DC:10 but increases by 5 every time you are forced to make a burnout check during that scene, to a maximum of DC: 20.\n\nAt the end of the scene, if there are a few moments for you to catch your breath, your accumulated burnout is reduced to 0, unless the Editor-in-Chief has other plans.\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Optional Rule: Taping your Maximum Potential\n\nCommonly, you cannot benefit from a score above your rank cap. But under specific circumstances, you might be able to tap into your untapped potential.\n\nWith the Editor-In-Chief’s approval, a hero can tap into their untapped potential for one action or reaction by expending a plot point; after you take this action, you pay enough burnout to surpass your burnout threshold by 1 if you are already past your burnout threshold you make all Burnout Check with Disadvantage till the end of the scene. Such instances should be rare, perhaps under extreme duress or extraordinary circumstances.  \n\\<side bar\\>\n\n**External Power Sources:** Some powers may have their own Burnout Threshold due to an external power source. Burnout of each power source is tracked separately. If you fail a Burnout Check with such a power source, all powers that use that power source, regardless of whether it has a burnout value, become inert until the end of the scene.\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Optional Rule: Brutal Continuity, Burnout\n\nEach time you successfully resist burning out (e.g., rolling higher than the threshold on a Burnout check), you gain a level of Exhaustion. Exhaustion represents the physical and mental strain of pushing your powers to the limit. The levels of Exhaustion have cumulative effects on your character, such as penalties to ability checks, pace, and combat abilities. These effects can be detailed on page XX, and the specific penalties can increase with each additional level of Exhaustion gained.\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>\n\n## Retaining Powers Scene to Scene\n\nPowers with the *Scene* characteristic may be retained from scene to scene. If you choose to keep a power active, you start the new scene with an amount of burnout as if they had just activated their power.\n\n\\<H2\\> Power List\n\n### Table X-X Powers\n\nAquatic Adaptation\n\nAdoptive Muscle Memory\n\nAdsorb Energy\n\nAdsorb Matter\n\nAnimate Object\n\nArmor\n\nBestial Transformation\n\nBotanokinesis\n\nBroadcast\n\nCatfall\\*\n\nCelerity\\*\n\nChameleon\n\nCommunicate with Animals\n\nCommunicate with Plants\n\nControl Weather\n\nConvert Matter\n\nDamaging Form\n\nDarkness\n\nDefection\n\nDensity Control\n\nDuplicate\n\nDynamic Power\n\nEidetic Memory\n\nElasticity\n\nEnergy Blast\n\nEnergy Explosion\n\nEnergy Generation\n\nEnergy Manipulation\n\nEnergy Sheath\n\nEmotion Control\n\nEndurance\\*\n\nEnhanced Attack\\*\n\nEnhanced Ability Score\\*\n\nEnhanced Sense\\*\n\nEntangle\n\nFlight\n\nForce Field\n\nForce Field.

Additionally, you gain the ability to see clearly in murky water, making it easier to navigate and interact with underwater environments.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\nEmulated Power: *Life Support:* Breathing underwater only\n\n### \\<h3\\>Absorb Energy\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Constitution\n\n*You can use the energy of incoming attacks to boost your potential.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose one energy type (e.g., fire, cold, kinetic) and one target ability score or a power to boost.\n\nWhenever you take damage from the chosen energy type, you gain a bonus to the selected trait equal to the damage taken, up to a maximum of your **Absorb Energy** power score modifier. This bonus lasts until the end of your next turn.\n\nIf this power and the boosted trait are **linked**, you also gain **Damage Resistance** (DR) against the chosen energy type equal to your Absorb Energy modifier.\n\n**Note:** If you damage multiple times between turns, only the highest single boost applies.\n\n**Example:**  \nPlastinex has Absorb Energy (Kinetic): 20, boosting her Energy Blast (Kinetic): 16. After her turn, she takes 2 kinetic damage from a zombie punch (boosting her blast to 18), then 10 more from a hurled trash bin (boosting it to 21 until the end of her next turn). Her power score modifier is +5, so 21 is the cap.\n\n**Special (Multiple Instances):**  \nYou may take Absorb Energy multiple times, each with a different energy type or trait to boost. If more than one power could be boosted by the same energy hit, choose one.\n\n**Special (Unique Power Modification):  \n***Explosive Limitation (+2 flaw):*  As an optional power modification unique to this ability, you may choose to have an absorption limit. If you take more damage from your chosen energy type than your **Absorb Energy** power score between turns, you risk overloading. At the start of your next turn, all creatures and objects in your area suffer your power’s base die in damage, with any creatures in the area suffering half Dexterity upon a successful saving throw.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Absorb Matter\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom or Charisma\n\n**Action:** Bonus\n\n**Burnout:** 8\n\n*You can touch something - a length of wood, a chunk of stone, a piece of twisted metal - and gain the properties of the substance.*\n\n**Effect:** By touching a solid, natural, or manufactured substance, you absorb its toughness. You can’t absorb the properties of non-solids like air, fire, water, or energy.\n\nYou must pay Burnout each time you absorb a new material, and you can only fully absorb materials with a Material Score (MS) equal to or less than your power score. If you touch a material with a higher MS, you instead gain the maximum bonus your power allows.\n\nYou gain Strength, Constitution, and occasionally Dexterity bonuses based on the absorbed material or your power score, whichever is lower (see table). These bonuses last until the end of the scene.\n\n| Min Power Score | Material                 | Bonus to Abilities              |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 10              | Rubber                   | +1 Dexterity, +1 Constitution   |\n|                 | Plastics, Tempered Glass | +1 Constitution                 |\n|                 | Ceramic, Leather         | +1 Strength, +1 Constitution    |\n|                 | Hard Plastics            | +1 Strength, +2 Constitution    |\n| 11-12           | Wood                     | +2 Strength, +2 Constitution    |\n| 13-16           | Aluminum                 | +2 Strength, +4 Constitution    |\n| 17-20           | Stone/Concrete/Brick     | +4 Strength, +4 Constitution    |\n| 21-24           | Iron                     | +4 Strength, +6 Constitution    |\n| 25-28           | Steel                    | +6 Strength, +6 Constitution    |\n| 29-32           | Carbon Steel Alloy       | +6 Strength, +8 Constitution    |\n| 33-36           | Titanium                 | +8 Strength, +8 Constitution    |\n| 37-40           | Tungsteel                | +8 Strength, +10 Constitution   |\n| 41+             | Palladium Metallic Glass | +10 Strength, +10 Constitution  |\n\n*For example,* Sponge has Absorb Material 14. Touching ceramic tile, he gains +1 Strength and +1 Constitution. Later, he touches an iron rail (MS 21) and pays Burnout again, but since his power score is only 14, he caps at +2 Strength and +4 Constitution instead.\n\n**Special (Unique Power Modifications):**\n\n-   *Appearance (+0 Flaw):* Your body visibly transforms to resemble the absorbed material.\n-   *Slow as Stone (+2 Flaw):* For each point of Strength you gain, reduce your Pace by 1 (minimum 1 area).\n-   *Absorb Material Strength (-4 Perk):* You gain **Damage Resistance vs. physical damage** equal to the absorbed material’s MS or **2 + your power score modifier,** whichever is lower.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Adoptive Muscle Memory\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Action/Bonus\n\n**Burnout:** 8/2\n\n*You possess the extraordinary ability to rapidly learn and replicate physical skills and feats you observe in action.*\n\n**Effect:** After witnessing a physical application of a Skill Set (one using Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) or a Feat in action, you may spend 8 Burnout as an Action to commit it to memory. You must be within 2 areas of the subject or have visual access via video or surveillance.\n\nYou can store a number of skills set applications or feats equal to half your power score modifier (rounded down). If you’re at capacity, you must overwrite an existing one.\n\nTo recall a memorized feat or application, spend 2 Burnout as a Bonus Action. It remains active for the rest of the scene. For Skill Set applications, use the original observed rank bonus, capped by your Adoptive Muscle Memory power bonus.\n\nYou begin play with one memorized feat.\n\nExample: KopyKat has Adoptive Muscle Memory 18 (+4 modifier). She watches a hero pick a lock using a Dexterity-based Skill Set +2 rank bonus. She spends 8 hours to learn how to pick a lock. Later, she recalls it for 2 Burnout, rolling with +2, even though her power could support more.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\nPower Trick:  *Copy Skill Set*\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>\n\n### Power Trick: Copy Skill Set\n\n**Power:** Adoptive Muscle Memory\n\n**Action:** Enclave Interlude **  \nCost:** +2 Burnout to recall\n\n**Effect:** You may commit an entire Skill Set’s physical application to memory by studying it extensively. This counts as **2 memorized slots** toward your total.\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Animate Object\n\nScene, Melee\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Charisma\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 8/2\n\n*You possess the extraordinary ability to bring non-living matter to life and command objects to perform tasks on your behalf.*\n\n**Effect:** You can animate a medium or smaller object with a Material Strength (MS) equal to or less than your power score. The object follows a simple command of your choosing, executing it to the best of its limited ability. Once complete, it becomes inert until the end of the scene or until you issue a new command. Initially, animating an Object takes an Action and costs 8 Burnout, while issuing new commands requires a bonus action and costs 2 burnout.\n\n*Animated Objects have the following stats:*\n\n-   Strength & Dexterity: Equal to your Charisma score\n-   Avoidance / Fortitude Defense of 12\n-   Willpower: Immune to any power that attacks Willpower\n-   HP Equivalent: Uses Material Strength (MS) and Hits instead of Stamina/Wounds\n-   Mental Stats: 0 unless enhanced by Imbue Consciousness\n-   If commanded to attack, the object makes a basic melee attack:\n    -   To Hit: Equal to your power score modifier\n    -   Damage: Your power score’s base die, as Kinetic, Slashing, or Piercing.\n\nThis power functions solely on non-living, non-sentient objects. Please note that zombies and other undead creatures are considered \"living\" for the purpose of this power. You may only animate one object at a time. Starting a new animation ends the previous one.\n\nAnd as your power grows, you can animate larger objects:\n\n-   At a power score of 20+, you can animate larger objects.\n-   At a power score of 30+, you can animate Huge objects.\n\n**Special (Synergy):** You may take the synergy power modification, synergizing Animate Object and Imbue Consciousness.\n\n**Special (Combining Effects):** You can combine this power with Animate Object and Imbue Consciousness, using both powers simultaneously, for 10 burnout.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Armor\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Constitution or Dexterity\n\n*You possess a level of protection from physical attacks.*\n\n**Effect:** You possess Damage Reduction (DR) equal to your power score modifier against Physical Damage. This power is significantly less effective against energy attacks, granting you only half your power score modifier against Energy Damage and no DR against attacks that deal Psychic or Poison damage.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Bestial Transformation\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Constitution\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 6\n\n*You can shapeshift into an animal.*\n\n**Effect:** You can change your shape to become any animal of medium size. When you do so, you retain your Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability scores, Feats, Defenses, Stamina, and Wounds. But gain the animal's Strength and Dexterity scores, attacks, natural abilities, and pace.\n\nWhile using this power, all your equipment melds into your new form (becoming unusable for the duration of this ability).\n\nYou can change into the form of any animal you have personally seen; you start play with several animal forms equal to half your Power Score Modifier.\n\n**Special (Combining Effects):** You can combine this power with Growth and Shrinking Powers to assume animal forms of varying sizes. When doing so, you only pay one-half the Burnout from both powers, rounded up. For example, taking the form of a large animal would give you 6 burnout (3 for Growth and 3 for Bestial Transformation).\n\n**Special (Unique Power Modification):**\n\n*Limitation (+4 flaw):* Limit your power to a single animal type (For example, dogs)\n\n*Limitation (+2 flaw):* May only take on a hybrid form (see power trick: hybrid form below) instead of animal forms.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* You may learn both Enhanced Attribute (Dexterity) and Enhanced Attribute (Strength), but these are restricted to use in your animal or hybrid form (see below). Additionally, you may learn Chameleon and Multiple Limbs, but only if appropriate to the beast or hybrid form.\n\n*Power Trick: Hybrid Form*\n\nYou may learn a single hybrid animal form (a cross between an animal and a human, such as the classic movie Werewolf). When you take a hybrid form, you gain the animal’s strength and dexterity scores if they are higher than yours. Also, any time you take your hybrid form, you may choose two of the following: the creature’s pace, attacks, or natural abilities. For example, if you take the form of the werewolf mentioned above, you may choose the wolf's pace and bite attack or the wolf’s pace and natural abilities of enhanced senses (smell) and senses (hearing). Supernatural creatures who have learn this power trick automatically know this power trick.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Bind\n\nRanged, Scene  \n**Primary Ability:** Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, or Strength\n\n**Action:** Action  \nBurnout: 4\n\n*You can hold people in place.*\n\n**Effect:** You may attempt to restrain a large or smaller creature within range. Describe the narrative source of your binding (tendrils, vines, shadow strands, psychic force, etc.). Make a ranged attack against the target’s Avoidance. On a success, the target is *Restrained (immobilized)* (see pg. XX).  \n  \nWhile restrained, a creature may attempt to break free on its turn by making a Strength saving throw against your Power DC (maximum 20).\n\nThis power can also hinder even larger creatures. If used against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, they are not fully restrained or incapacitated. Still, instead, you may choose to reduce the target's pace by half (minimum of 1) or give them Disadvantage on their next attack or ability score check.\n\n**Special:** You can take this power multiple times, choosing a different source or energy type (e.g., psychic bind, vine bind, shadow bind). Each is tracked separately and may have a different Primary Ability, depending on the concept.\n\nPower Stunts  \n*Emulated Powers:* Swinging\n\n*Power Trick:* Area Bind  \n  \n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n### Power Stunt: Area Bind\n\n**Associated Power:** Bind  \n**Cost:** +2 Burnout  \n**Effect:** Instead of targeting a single creature, you may attempt to bind all creatures within one Area.\n\nMake a single Power Check and compare it to each creature’s Avoidance in the Area. On a success, all targets are *Restrained (immobilized)*\n\nEach affected creature must still make individual Strength saving throws on their turn to break free, using your Power DC (still capped at 20).\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Botanokinesis\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence\n\n**Action: Action**\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You can mentally summon, control, and manipulate plants and vegetation.*\n\n**Effect:** With Botanokinesis, you can manipulate plants and vegetation in various ways, utilizing your power score as a measure of your control and effectiveness. Some possible applications of this power include:\n\n-   **Plant Manipulation:** You can mentally control plants' growth, movement, and shape within a radius equal to your power score modifier in areas. You can make them grow rapidly, change their shape, or even animate them to perform simple tasks. You can also command plants to entangle or restrain targets, using your power score instead of any strength-based skill set, using a strength equal to your power score.\n-   **Plant Growth:** By channeling your power, you can accelerate the growth and maturation of plants, causing them to sprout, bloom, and bear fruits or flowers almost instantaneously. This ability allows you to create obstacles or difficult terrain by rapidly growing dense vegetation.\n-   **Healing and Restoration:** You can heal and restore plants, mending damaged foliage, accelerating recovery from diseases or pests, and revitalizing wilted or dying vegetation.\n-   **Environmental Influence:** You can manipulate the local environment to a limited extent. You can generate localized changes in temperature and humidity, create areas of shade or sunlight, or even purify the air by enhancing the plant's natural filtration capabilities.\n\n**Special (Limitation):** Your control over plants is limited to existing vegetation and cannot create new plants or generate plant life from nothing. The effectiveness and size of your manipulation depend on the availability and proximity of suitable plant life in the area.\n\n**Special (Synergy):** You may take synergy power modification, synergizing Botanokinesis and Communicate with Plants.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Communicate with Plants, Chameleon (by manipulating plants to create natural camouflage to conceal yourself), Energy Blast (Kinetic, hitting with rapidly growing roots), Entangle, Move Object, Poison.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Broadcast\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence\n\n**Action: Action** (to tune in)\n\n**Burnout:** 5 (to broadcast for one Scene)\n\nYou can tune in to electromagnetic broadcasts.\n\n**Effect:** By taking an action to “tune in” to a particular frequency, you can pick up electromagnetic communication such as radio, television, and wireless LAN broadcasts in your area. At higher Power Scores, you can also broadcast on your chosen frequency to a distance equal to your power score modifier x1000 feet. This broadcast is considered the strongest transmission within this range, replacing any other broadcasts on that frequency. As you increase your power score, you can receive visual communications, “seeing” them in your mind and even broadcast visual communications, either broadcasting what you see or constructing simple images in your imagination.\n\nYou may transmit images of what you see while using this power. Still, if you attempt to transmit images from memory, or attempt to create images whole cloth, you must succeed in a Daunting (DC 25) power check to create a believable image.\n\n| Power Score | Capability                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 10-11       | Receive shortwave radio broadcasts.                                                                                                                             |\n| 12-13       | Receive all radio broadcasts.                                                                                                                                   |\n| 14-15       | Broadcast shortwave radio broadcasts                                                                                                                            |\n| 16-17       | Broadcast all radio broadcasts.                                                                                                                                 |\n| 18-20       | Receive all wireless electromagnetic communications, including visual and wireless LAN.                                                                         |\n| 21-25       | Broadcast all audio wireless electromagnetic communications.                                                                                                    |\n| 26-29       | Receive all electromagnetic communications, wireless or not, in your area.                                                                                      |\n| 30-39       | Broadcast all wireless electromagnetic communications, including visual and wireless LAN.                                                                       |\n| 40+         | Broadcast all electromagnetic communications, wireless or not, in your area.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you land on your feet.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Celerity\n\n**Primary Ability:** Dexterity\n\n**Action:** Special (See Below)\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*You may perform actions with amazing Dexterity*\n\n**Effect:** You may reduce the speed of any action by one step, from *Demanding Action* to *Action* or *Action* to *Bonus Action.* Additionally, you may use this ability to take an additional *Reaction* before the start of your next turn. This power is particularly taxing; you may use this power a number of times equal to your power score modifier before requiring a Hiatus.\n\n**For Example:**\n\nVelocity finds himself facing two scavengers armed with shotguns. Going first, he chooses to reduce the cost of his Attack Action to Bonus Action, allowing him to attack one of the scavengers with his Katana, gaining 4 points of burnout. After this, he can attack the same scavenger or even the other with his action.\n\nAfter the scavenger’s actions, where both of them used their very loud shotguns, Celerity decides it’s better to get the heck out of dodge as the noise of those two shotguns will start attracting Z’s from all over the place. So, he starts his turn by choosing to attack one scavenger with his action and then take the dash action, bringing his total burnout to 8.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers*: Temporal Fugue\n\n### \\<H3\\>Chameleon\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom\n\n**Speed:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*You can take on the colors of the world around you.*\n\n**Effect:** The power allows you to blend into your surroundings, provided you’re not moving (or moving very slowly). Once you activate this power, you gain a bonus to all Dexterity-based challenges to sneak around equal to your power score modifier; this bonus is in addition to any bonus granted by a skill set or edge.\n\nThis power works best if you don’t move, as you usually can’t adapt to your changing surroundings quickly enough to remain blended in. If you move more than 1 area per turn, you only gain half your power score modifier.\n\nWhen you use this power, you must have something to blend into—the Editor-in-Chief may ask for a Power Check versus the DC of your surroundings to blend in. Note that nearly empty, very plain, or monochromatic areas will be far easier to disappear into than very colorfully cluttered areas or backgrounds with moving colors (such as LED screens, moving smoke, and the like).\n\n### \\<h3\\>Communicate with Animals\n\nContinuous, Ranged (0)\n\n**Primary Ability:** Charisma\n\n*You can communicate with animals.*\n\n**Effect:** You can communicate telepathically with animals of all kinds. You may communicate with a few animal types equal to half your power score modifier.\n\nThis power does not initially allow for complex communication. When this power is in use, you imbue animals with an echo of your sentience; as such, you increase an animal’s effective intelligence by half your power score modifier, rounded down to a minimum of 1.\n\nSo, if you possess Communicate with Animals: 14, you increase the target animal’s intelligence by +2. Keep in mind that Mammals, Cetaceans, and Primates are capable of conveying much more complex thoughts.\n\n**Animal Type**\n\nCetaceans\n\nPrimates\n\nMarsupials\n\nBirds\n\nReptiles\n\nFish\n\nAmphibians\n\nArachnids\n\nInsects\n\nMollusks\n\nEchinoderms\n\nAnnelids\n\n**Special (Unique Power Modification)**\n\n*Limitation Power Flaw (+2/+4/+8):* You may limit this power to a particular habitat or animal type. Limiting communications to land-based animals is a +2 flaw, while limiting communications to marine or alien animals would be a +4 flaw. Alternately, a Hero could limit the power to one of the types listed above, allowing them to ONLY communicate with that category of animals and gain a +8 bonus to the power’s starting power score.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Summon Animal\n\n### \\<H3\\>Communicate with Plants\n\nContinuous, Ranged\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Charisma\n\n**Action: Action**\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You possess the ability to potentially communicate telepathically with plants of all kinds.* **  \n**\n\n**Effect:** This power works a little differently than Communication with Animals as it imparts a shard of sentience upon the target, defined as an echo of your consciousness. You may communicate with a number of plant types equal to half your power score modifier.\n\n**Plant types**\n\nTrees\n\nFerns\n\nWeeds\n\nGrasses\n\nFlowering Plants\n\nMoss and Fungus\n\nAlgae\n\nLichens\n\nThis power does not allow for complex communication at first. Even when imbued with an echo of your sentience, the plant’s effective intelligence is half your power score modifier, rounded down to a minimum of 1. So, if you possess Communicate with Plants: 14, you would imbue the target plant (such as a fern) with an intelligence of 2, while someone with a power score of 30 in this power would grant the plant an intelligence of 5, roughly equal to that of a below-average human.\n\n**Special (Unique Power Modification)**\n\n*Limitation Power Flaw (+2/+6):* You may limit this power to a particular habitat. Limiting communications to land-based plants is a +2 Flaw, while limiting communications to marine or alien plants would be a +6 Flaw. Alternatively, you could limit the power to one of the categories listed above, such as Trees, Flowering Plants, or Moss, allowing them to ONLY communicate with that plant category and gain a +8 bonus to the power’s starting power score.\n\n**Special (Synergy):** You may take synergy power modification, synergizing Botanokinesis and Communicate with Plants.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Botanokinesis\n\n### \\<h3\\>Control Weather\n\nInterruptible, Ranged, Scene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom\n\n**Action: Action**\n\n**Burnout:** 10\n\n*You can change the weather. You can make it rain on a sunny day, call forth snow in the middle of summer, whip up tornadoes, and so on.*\n\n**Effect:** You may create or alter weather across a radius of up to half your power score modifier in miles, affecting a minimum number of Areas equal to half your power score modifier (rounded down). You cannot precisely sculpt the weather, only its scale and type.\n\nTo reduce or counter another weather effect (or natural conditions), roll a Power Check against a DC equal to the original power score or natural condition rank (see below). Each point above the DC reduces that condition by one step.\n\nYou may always create lower-tier weather effects than your score allows. Damage is based on your Power Score Die at your current rank.\n\n10-11: Create light rain, fog, breeze, snow. All creatures within the area affected suffer a penalty equal to your power score modified to meet any challenge that depends on a creature's sense of sight or hearing.\n\n12-13: Create steady rain, fog, snow, or a steady breeze. All creatures within the area affected suffer the above penalties. Additionally, anyone moving within the affected area has their pace reduced by 1 to a minimum of 1.\n\n14-17: Create medium to heavy rain or snow. All creatures within the area affected suffer the above penalties. At this point, the rain can start to wash small objects away or create flash flood conditions in confined Areas. The snow can accumulate quickly enough to cover mud, grass, gravel tracks, or ice over small bodies of still water, allowing you to create a number of areas of difficult terrain equal to half your power score modifier.\n\n18-20: Create heavy to heavy rain or snow. All creatures within the area affected suffer the above penalties. At this point, all the areas affected by your power are now considered difficult terrain.\n\n21-29: Create very heavy rain or snow with strong, buffeting winds. All creatures within the area affected suffer the above penalties. Additionally, all flying creatures have their pace reduced by half (to a minimum of 1), and hovering becomes impossible.\n\n30-39: Create thunderstorms, snowstorms, or windstorms. All creatures within the area affected suffer the above penalties. In addition, if you possess the power energy blast (lightning) or Move Object (using wind) as a bonus action.\n\n40+: At this level, you're unleashing weather on an apocalyptic scale. All previous effects apply, but the impact becomes largely narrative: tornadoes tear down buildings, hurricanes uproot trees and flood entire districts, and blizzards create white-out conditions where visibility is nearly zero.\n\nWind howls loud enough to drown out shouting, and the terrain becomes treacherous, flooded streets, collapsed structures, and massive snowdrifts that count as obstacles. Water freezes solid, roofs cave in, and entire Areas may become impassable.\n\n**Power Stunts**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Energy Blast (electrical, lightning bolts), Move Object (controlled use of wind to move items)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Convert Matter\n\n*Interruptible, Melee, Scene*\n\n**Primary Ability:** Intelligence\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You can convert non-living matter into another type of non-living matter.*\n\n**Effect:** You may convert non-living, non-sentient matter, organic or inorganic, into another material of your choosing. The maximum weight you can convert equals one-fourth of your Max Lift at your power score. For example, Convert Matter 20 allows up to 200 lbs. of material to be transformed.\n\nThe base material and the target material must be mostly homogeneous. Non-convertible components (e.g., a metal doorknob on a wooden door) are discarded or left unchanged.\n\nYou may automatically convert items with an MS less than your passive power DC to affect tougher materials; make a Power Check against the target’s MS.\n\n*Example:* With Convert Matter 15 and Intelligence 14, you may attempt to convert Titanium (MS 30) into Steel (MS 20) with a Power Check vs. DC 30.\n\nWhile all converted materials revert at the end of the scene, with Editor-in-Chief approval, you may spend a Plot Point to make the change permanent.\n\n**Special (Undead):**  \nUndead creatures, including zombies, are considered “alive” and cannot be affected.\n\n**Power Stunts**\n\nEmulated Powers: *Manifest Gear*, *Inventive gadgetry*\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\nCreative Use of Convert material may sometimes constitute “changing a scene” and require the use of a plot point; this is not always the case, but such requirements are left up to the editor-in-chief.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Damaging Form\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom\n\n**Action: Bonus**\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*It hurts to hit you.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose an Energy (except Psychic damage. See below); as a bonus action, you surround yourself with a damaging field of your chosen energy type. Any creature that hits you with a melee attack or starts its turn grappling you suffers your Power Score Die in damage.\n\n**Special (psychic shields):** Alternately, you may choose psychic energy as your energy type; if you do, this power is only effective against psychic attacks. Any attacker who deals psychic damage to you or attempts to control your mind is damaged by this power. Due to the limited scope of this power, you also add your wisdom modifier to the damage dealt.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Energy Sheath\n\n### \\<h3\\>Darkness\n\nRanged (0)\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You seem to emanate darkness from your body, and with it, you may control the brightness of an area or plunge it into pitch blackness.*\n\n**Effect:**  You can project darkness from your body. This is not the absence of light per se but a unique energy conjured from an unknown dimension.\n\nWith this power, you lower the illumination (see pg. XX) of the area you are in, plus a number of adjacent areas equal to half your Power Score Modifier (Minimum of 1) by 1 illumination step. (for example, bright light to shadowy) You may further reduce the illumination by reducing the maximum number of areas you can affect by 2 for each additional step. *Example:* Dropping an area from Bright to Total Darkness (2 steps) reduces your area coverage by 4.\n\n**Light vs. Darkness:**  \nWhen a power-based light source is introduced into your darkness, make a Power Check against that power’s passive power DC On a successful check, the light's illumination level is reduced by 1 and restricted to the area it’s in. On a field check, the light remains unaffected but only reaches into adjacent areas. For gear (e.g., flashlights), use DC = 10 + the number of Areas of bright light the item produces.\n\nInterestingly, this power also grants you the ability to see perfectly through your darkness, as if you possessed the power of Super Sense at an equal Power Score.\n\n**Special (Access):** You may learn Elemental/Energy Manipulation (Darkness), allowing you to shape the darkness you generate into a physical form. You may also learn a special kind of Super Sense (Darkness Sense) that would allow you to see within the darkness the effects of others and listen into any area you are affecting with your power. Unless you possess the Darkness power, you may *not* acquire Elemental/Energy Manipulation (Darkness) or Super Sense (Darkness Sense)\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Power:* Energy Manipulation (Darkness), Environmental Manipulation (shadows), Super Sense (Darkness Sense)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Deflection\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Strength or Dexterity\n\n**Action:** Reaction\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You can knock away incoming attacks.*\n\n**Effect:** When you are the target of a ranged attack, you may make an opposed Power Check against the attack roll against you. If you are successful, you deflect away damage equal to half your power score; you take any damage remaining, which DR may further reduce.\n\n**Special (Unique Power Modifications):**\n\n*Limited Deflection (+2/+6):* You can use this Flaw to define what you can deflect. Deflecting bullets would be worth +2 (everyone has bullets), while if you can only deflect laser beams, such a flaw may be worth +6.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Power Trick:* Reflection\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>\n\n### Power Trick: Reflection\n\n**Powers:** Deflection\n\n**Cost:** +5 Burnout\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance\n\n**Effect:** When you successfully deflect an incoming attack, you may reflect that damage to any creature within range of the attacking power with a successful attack roll.\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Density Control\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Constitution\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You can increase your mass, becoming physically denser and harder to hurt.*\n\n**Effect:** You may increase your mass to a level dictated by your power score (see the accompanying chart). When you do so, increase your Strength and gain DR equal to your power score modifier against Physical damage attacks.\n\nThe following chart gives a rough idea of your character’s mass when purchasing Density Control.\n\n| **Density Control Mass** |                           |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Power Score**          | **Max Mass Gained**       |\n| 10-13                    | 300 to 400 pounds.        |\n| 14-15                    | 500 to 800 pounds         |\n| 16-19                    | 900 to 1,200 pounds       |\n| 20-24                    | 1,300 to 2,400 pounds     |\n| 25-29                    | 2,500 to 4,800 pounds     |\n| 30-34                    | 4,900 to 9,600 pounds     |\n| 35-39                    | 9,700 to 19,200 pounds    |\n| 40-44                    | 19,300 to 38,400 pounds   |\n| 45-49                    | 38,500 to 76,800 pounds   |\n| 50+                      | 76,900 to 153,600 pounds  |\n\n**Note:** Becoming supermassive on certain surfaces may cause you to crash right through the floor. At the end of every turn, roll your modified Strength Attribute Die and Power Score Die and apply the result against the Material Strength of the floor; if you surpass the amount of Hits on the surface you’re walking on, you fall through the floor. See Attacking and Destroying Objects pg. XX\n\n### \\<h3\\>Duplicate\n\nScene (or special, see below)\n\n**Primary Ability:** Charisma\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 8\n\n*There are more of you. This power allows you to do the work of two men. Or ten!*\n\n**Effect:** You create identical duplicates of yourself. Each duplicate (or “dup”) has your stats, skill sets, and powers, but no gear except clothing. Dups cannot use powers that cost Burnout and have no Burnout Threshold.\n\n-   Each dup has Stamina equal to your power score and 1 Wound. They can telepathically communicate with you and each other within a number of miles equal to your power score modifier (minimum 1).\n-   You create a number of dups equal to half your power score modifier (minimum 1). You may dismiss any dup as a Bonus Action.\n\nIf a dup is destroyed (“pops”), you and all remaining dups become *shaken* until the start of your next turn due to psychic feedback.\n\nAt the end of the scene, all dups automatically recombine with you, regardless of distance. You gain their memories.\n\n**Special Use (Persistent Dup):**  \nInstead of creating temporary duplicates, you can create one permanent duplicate.\n\nWhile this dup exists, you cannot use this power again, and your Burnout Threshold is reduced by 5.\n\nIf a dup is Z’d (infected/turned), it becomes autonomous. It no longer recombines, you lose control of it, and your Burnout Threshold remains reduced by 5 until it is destroyed.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Multiple Limbs\n\n### \\<h3\\>Dynamic Power\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n*You have an interesting knack for having the right power at the right time.*\n\n**Effect:** This power allows you to emulate one or more powers whose total power score is equal to your power score of this power -6. You choose what powers you have at the start of the scene. At the editor-in-chief’s discretion, you may be allowed to switch powers mid-scene at the cost of a plot die.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Eidetic Memory\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence\n\n**Action: Action**\n\n*Commonly referred to as photographic memory, Eidetic Memory is a psychological or medical term popularly defined as the ability to recall images, sounds, or objects in memory with extreme precision.*\n\n**Effect:** This power grants the following benefits\n\n-   You gain a bonus to all Intelligence-based challenges equal to half your power score modifier.\n-   You may attempt to recall useful information to help you with the task at hand. Before rolling to meet a challenge, roll a power check against the DC of the challenge +5; if successful, you gain an Advantage on your roll to meet the challenge.\n-   Recall a scene you have witnessed, a location you may have visited, or even something you may have read, which you do so with perfect picture clarity.\n\n**Special (Additional Skill Uses):** After recalling a scene, location, or something you read, the Editor-in-Chief may ask you to meet an intelligence-based challenge to search through your memories and seek out any details (detective-based skill sets would apply) to pick out useful/important details you might have missed\n\n**Power Stunts:**   \n*Power Trick:* Total Recall\n\n### \\<h3\\>Elasticity\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Constitution\n\n**Action:** Bonus or Reaction\n\n**Burnout:** None / 3\n\n*Your body has rubber-like elasticity. You can expand and contract limbs and gain some protection from your body stretching during an attack.*\n\n**Effect:** This power has two effects: a Continuous effect and an Activated effect.\n\n-   **Continuous Effect:** You can absorb more damage than most due to your elastic nature. You possess DR against Physical damage equal to your power score modifier. This effect has no burnout and is permanently active.\n-   **Activated Effect:** You may stretch any part of your body out a number of areas equal to your power score modifier. However, doing so may expose you to possible attacks. This does allow you to make *Melee* attacks from that number of areas away. You may also use this power to take on shapes, such as a ball. As noted, you may use this activation as a reaction in conjunction with an opportunity attack or a situation where changing your shape would be advantageous.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Catfall, Enhanced Attack, Multiple Limbs\n\n### \\<h3\\>Emotion Control\n\nScene, Ranged\n\n**Primary Ability:** Charisma\n\n**Attack:** Discipline\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*You can influence the emotional states of others.*\n\n**Effect:** Select an emotion. You can instill this emotion into a target with a successful Power Attack versus the target’s Willpower. You can also specify to whom the target feels the emotion. The Editor-in-Chief determines any situational modifiers (advantage or disadvantage) for your attack roll depending on the current emotional state of your target. For example, if Cara is deeply in love with Randall, you may suffer Disadvantage if you try to make Cara feel malice towards Randall.\n\nIf you instill emotions towards you, you gain a bonus to any charisma-based skill check equal to your power’s Passive Modifier. For example, feelings of admiration or trust may give you a bonus on Empathy skill checks. Instilling feelings of fear or distrust might give you a bonus on Influence skill check when attempting to intimidate someone.\n\nThe number of targets you may affect with this power is equal to your power score modifier and may only install a number of different emotions equal to half your power score modifier.\n\nWith a successful attack, you may instead choose to instill the *charmed (psionic)* or *frightened (psionic)* condition on a single target until the end of the scene. Affected creatures get a Charisma saving throw at the end of their turn to end this effect.\n\nThis is a mental power, and as such, it does not work on zombies or non-sentient targets.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Weaken (Mental Attributes only)\n\n*Power Tricks:* Aura of Fear, Influence the Masses\n\n\\<Sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\> Power Tricks\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Aura of Fear\n\n**Powers:** Emotion Control\n\n**Cost:** +3 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** You radiate an overwhelming presence that unsettles everyone nearby. As an action, make **one attack roll** against the Willpower Defense of all creatures within your Area. You can affect a number of targets per scene equal to your Power Score Modifier.\n\nAffected creatures are *frightened (psionic)* until the end of the scene. On their turn, each may attempt a Charisma saving throw against your power’s Passive DC. On a success, the fear ends.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Influence the Masses\n\n**Powers:** Emotion Control and Telepathy\n\n**Cost:** +3 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** You project a powerful emotional wave across a crowd. Choose a single emotion (e.g., love, awe, rage) to affect all creatures within a number of Areas equal to half your Power Score modifier (minimum 1). If appropriate, you may assign a **focus** for that emotion, either yourself or another visible creature.\n\nMake one attack roll and compare it to the Willpower Defense of each creature in the affected area. Those who fail are influenced accordingly.\n\n\\</Sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Endurance\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Constitution\n\n*You are a tireless engine, able to push yourself far beyond the limits of exhaustion.*\n\n**Effect:** Add your Power Score to your maximum stamina. Additionally, you can go a number of days equal to the power score modifier without any rest or sleep. So long as you are within this period, you automatically succeed in all checks to resist exhaustion due to lack of rest or normal exhaustion (like a forced march, you may not be able to run fast, but you can keep on running long after everyone else has collapsed). While this power does not make you immune to powers or other abilities that cause exhaustion or sleep, you add your Power Score Modifier to your Defenses and saving throws to resist those effects.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Energy Blast\n\nDamaging, Ranged.\n\n**Primary Ability:** Dexterity\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Attack:** by energy type (see energy types and targeted defenses)\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You generate blasts of energy or hurl a bolt of a particular element.*\n\n**Effect:**  Choose an Energy type from the *Energy Types and Targeted defense* *table* (see pg XX) you may use this power to attack a single target within range, dealing your chosen energy type in damage.\n\n**Special (Access):** You can take this power multiple times, choosing different energy types, each of which is tracked as its own power.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Enhanced Attack (same Energy type), Energy Explosion (same Energy type)\n\n*Power Tricks:* Energy Burst, Rapid Blast\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n### Power Trick: Energy Burst\n\n**Powers:** Energy Blast, Energy Manipulation\n\n**Cost:** +3 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** A Hero can opt for a burst effect targeting everyone in a single area rather than a single target. Every person within the burst, friend, and foe, is affected by the burst as if they were personally attacked.\n\n### Power Trick: Rapid Blast\n\n**Powers:** Energy Blast\n\n**Cost:** +4 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** After attacking with your energy blast, you may make another attack against any target within range as a bonus action.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Energy Explosion\n\nDamaging, Ranged\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Constitution\n\n**Action: Action**\n\n**Attack:** by energy type (see energy types and targeted defenses)\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You generate an explosion around you, affecting friend and foe alike.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose an Energy type. When you use this power, you attack everyone in your area and a number of adjoining areas equal to half your power score modifier. You can take this power multiple times, choosing different energy types, each being tracked as its own power.\n\n**Power Stunts:**   \n*Emulated Powers:* Energy Blast (same Energy type)\n\n\\<sidebar\\>  \n\\<h4\\> Power vs Power – Countering Environmental Effects\n\nIn scenes involving large-scale power effects, fire walls, ice storms, and electrified zones, heroes may attempt to counter or suppress them using appropriate opposing powers.\n\nTo do so, the player makes a Power Check using their relevant ability and Power Score modifier against the power’s passive DC.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief decides the scope of the counter: removing part of the effect, weakening it, or dispelling it completely.\n\nExamples:\n\n-   A hero with Water Generation uses their power to douse a Fire Wall (DC 16).\n-   A hero with Wind Manipulation disrupts an area Fog effect to clear line of sight.\n-   Ice Generation is used to freeze over or suppress Lava Jets.\n\nCounter attempts may require proximity to the effect, narrative setup, or specific power traits (e.g., Area Control, Environmental Focus).\n\n\\<.sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Energy Generation\n\nDamaging, Range (0)\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Attack:** by energy type (see energy types and targeted defenses)\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You seem to radiate energy from your own body.*\n\n**Effect:**  Choose an energy type; this power only grants you the ability to create energy, not shape it, with the power’s score representing the intensity of its generation. You can take this power multiple times, choosing different energy types, each being tracked as its own power.\n\nYou may use this power to haphazardly attack everyone in your area, whether friend or foe,\n\nRequiring a successful power attack roll.\n\n**Special (Synergy):** You may take a synergy power modification, synergizing Energy Generation and Energy Manipulation, if they all share the same energy type.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Absorb Energy (same type), Enhanced Attack, Energy Blast, Energy Explosion (same type), Energy Manipulation, Energy Sheath, Environmental Manipulation (same type)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Energy /Element Manipulation\n\nRanged, Scene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You can shape a particular form of energy, allowing you to give it a semblance of mass.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose an energy type or a natural element like earth, air, or water. You can mold that substance into simple or complex forms. Walls, bridges, and basic shapes are easy. More intricate constructs, like cages, tools, or moving parts, may require a Power Check, with the DC based on complexity (e.g., DC 10 for a cage, DC 20 for a working drawbridge). Objects may not take up more cubic areas than half your power’s passive modifier.\n\nThings you sculpt maintain their shape until the end of the scene, unless they are destroyed. At that point, they harmlessly revert to their previous form. Solid constructs have a Hardness equal to your power score and Hits equal to one-third your power score modifier (minimum 1), while constructs made of energy may be passed through; any creature that touches or passes through the energy construct suffers your power score die in damage.\n\nThis power doesn't create energy or elements; it simply gives shape to what is already present or assumed to be available. You can take this power multiple times, each with a different type, and they are tracked separately.\n\n**Special (Light, illuminate):** Someone manipulating light can also use their power to improve light conditions in an area. Thus, this power allows you to increase Shadowy light conditions to Bright light, affecting a number of areas equal to your Power Score Modifier.\n\n**Special (Synergy):** You may take the synergy power modification to synergize Energy Generation and Energy Manipulation, but only if they share the same energy type.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Absorb Energy\\*, Animate Object (allowing you to animate an object you create through this power), Energy Blast\\*, Energy Explosion\\*, Energy Sheath\\*, Enhanced Attack\\*   \n\\*same energy type as the parent power.\n\n*Power Tricks:* Energy Burst, Blinding Flash (Energy Manipulation: Light Only).\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Power Trick: Blinding Flash\n\nYou suddenly hyper-focus the ambient light around you, creating a blinding flash of light.\n\n**Powers:** Light, Energy Manipulation: Light\n\n**Cost:** +1 Burnout\n\n**Attack:** Fortitude\n\n**Effect:** With a successful attack, you blind all creatures in your area until the end of your next turn. Once a creature is affected by this ability, you suffer the disadvantage of affecting them again, as they know what you’re capable of and will move to divert their eyes.\n\nEditor’s Note:\n\nNote that although the power trick above is limited to light, there is no reason why a player cannot develop a similar power trick using a different energy type, such as comic energy or even fire. Although power tricks throughout this book are examples of power tricks, you and your players should feel free to develop new ones.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Energy Sheath\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Bonus\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\nYou are surrounded by an energy field that protects you from damage.\n\n**Effect:** Choose an energy type. You surround yourself with a protective sheath of that energy.\n\nWhile active, you gain Damage Resistance (DR) equal to twice your power score against that energy type, and DR equal to half your power score modifier against all physical and other energy damage.\n\nThe sheath flexes around impact points, allowing you to move normally, standing on the ground, handling objects, or making melee attacks, without damaging your surroundings. However, you gain no bonus to melee damage from the sheath itself.\n\nYou may take this power multiple times, selecting a different energy type each time. Each version is tracked separately, but only one Energy Sheath may be active at a time.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Absorb Energy (same type), Damaging Form, Energy Blast, Energy Generation, Energy Manipulation, and Enhanced Attack.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Enhanced Ability Score\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Chosen Ability Score.\n\n*One of your natural attributes has been… enhanced.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose one ability score. This power enhances that score in one of two ways (you choose when this power is first gained, but you may switch between the two effects narratively if the situation changes, such as your body failing but your power remaining active):\n\n-   **Additive:** Increase that ability score by this power’s modifier (minimum +1).\n-   **Substitution:** Replace the ability score with this power’s raw score (if higher).\n\nYou can take this power multiple times, each time for a different ability score.\n\n**Special (Rank Cap):** This power may not increase an ability score beyond your current **Rank Cap**. Any excess is considered untapped potential until your Rank increases.\n\nPower Stunt:   \nEnhanced Ability Score (Strength): *Emulated Power*: *Leaping*   \nEnhanced Ability Score (Dexterity): *Emulated Power: Speed*\n\nEnhanced Ability Score (Constitution): *Emulated Power: Invulnerability*\n\nEnhanced Ability Score (Wisdom): *Emulated Power: Sixth Sense*\n\nEnhanced Ability Score (Intelligence): *Emulated Power: Ultimate Skill*\n\nEnhanced Ability Score (Charisma): *Emulated Power: Luck*\n\n### \\<h3\\>Enhanced Melee Attack\n\nContinuous, damaging (special, see below), Melee, *or* Weapon\n\n**Primary Ability:** Strength, Dexterity, *or* Wisdom\n\n**Action:**  None/Bonus (if applicable)\n\n*Your melee attacks hit harder, whether it’s claws, crackling fists, or a weapon that burns on Impact.*\n\n**Effect:   \n**You enhance either your unarmed strikes or a specific melee weapon with deadly force or elemental energy. This power can be taken multiple times for different energy types or weapon setups, but effects do not stack, and each instance of this power is tracked separately.**  \n**\n\n-   *Enhanced Unarmed Melee Attack:*\n\n    Choose a damage type and whether the effect is always active or can be turned on/off. If it can be concealed (e.g., retractable claws, flaming fists), it requires a **Bonus Action** to activate or deactivate.  \n    Your unarmed melee attacks deal: Power Score Die + Power Modifier + Primary Attribute Modifier in damage.\n\n-   *Enhanced Melee Weapon Attack:*\n\n    Choose a specific melee weapon and damage type. If the effect is something like electrifying or igniting the weapon, it also takes a Bonus Action to activate/deactivate. While active, your attacks with that weapon deal extra damage equal to your Power Score Die of the chosen type.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Enhanced Sense\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n*One of your senses is enhanced.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose one of the five senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch. Whenever you rely on that sense when making a roll to meet a Challenge, you add your Power Score Modifier to the result.\n\nThis applies whether or not you're applying a Skill Set to the Challenge. You may take this power multiple times, each time selecting a different sense, tracking each power as its own instance.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Entangle\n\nDamaging (special), Interruptible, Range\n\n**Primary Ability:** Strength *or* Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*You can extend your power to grab, restrain, and crush a target.*\n\nEffect: You may initiate a Grab maneuver using your Power Score in place of a Melee attack. If successful, you may also use your Power Score in place of any ability score during Face-Off Challenges while grappling your target.\n\nTargets grappled by this power cannot reverse the grapple—they may only attempt to escape (see Face-Offs and Grappling, pg. XX).\n\nWhile holding your target, you may choose to apply pressure on your turn, dealing Kinetic damage equal to your Power Score base die. Doing so costs 1 additional Burnout.\n\nTo maintain the grapple, you must concentrate and pay 1 Burnout at the start of each turn.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Flight\n\n**Primary Ability:** Dexterity\n\n**Burnout:** 3/1\n\n*You can fly.*\n\n**Effect:** During combat, until the end of your next turn, you gain a fly pace equal to your power score modifier. Out of combat, you may fly at a pace equal to your power score, but any attack against you while flying at this speed is done so with Advantage as you are focused on your flight.\n\nYou must pay 1 burnout at the beginning of every turn that you use this power to remain aloft. While flying, you may carry anything your strength can typically carry up to your max lift.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Power:* Glide\n\n### \\<h3\\>Force Field\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom or Charisma\n\n**Burnout:** Action/Reaction\n\n**Burnout:** 5/2\n\n*You can erect a force field to protect yourself or others.*\n\n**Effect:** As an action, or as a reaction when you’re aware of an incoming attack, you generate a force field covering up to half your Power Score modifier in Areas (minimum 1). For each additional Area beyond the first, reduce the effective Power Score of the field by 2. (Example: a field spanning 4 Areas reduces your Power Score by 8 for its effects.)\n\nThe field blocks movement, creatures cannot pass through it, and it can withstand or support weight according to its Power Score.\n\nThe force field has Stamina equal to your Power Score and absorbs damage from outside attacks targeting those inside. Once active, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can refresh its duration and stamina as a bonus action by paying 2 Burnout.\n\nIf the field takes more Stamina damage than your Power Score or if you suffer a wound, the field collapses. Those inside are shielded from the attack that brought it down, but you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to the damage dealt) or become *shaken* until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Damaging Form, Deflection, Energy Blast (kinetic), Energy Explosion (kinetic), Enhanced Attack (kinetic), Force Shield.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Force Field, Personal\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom *or* Intelligence\n\n**Burnout:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You can create a personal, skin-tight force field.*\n\n**Effect:** As an action on your turn, you can generate a personal force field to protect yourself. The force field grants you temporary stamina points equal to your power score modifier, which remains until the end of the scene. If, at any point during the scene, you start a turn with fewer temporary stamina points than your power score modifier, the force field regenerates back to its original value, up to a maximum number of temporary stamina points equal to your power score modifier. If your personal force field absorbs a total amount of damage equal to your power score in one turn, it is brought down, ending its effect. Note that the force field only protects you and not anyone else.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Deflection, Elemental/Energy Blast (kinetic), Enhanced Attack (kinetic), Force Shield, Life-Support.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Free Consciousness\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Burnout:** 8\n\n*You possess the ability to separate your consciousness from your physical body, entering an intangible, incorporeal state known as astral projection.*\n\n**Effect:** By making a Power Check (DC 10 for calm meditation, DC 20 during combat, DC 30 under direct attack), you project your consciousness from your body. While projected, your body remains helpless but alive, it cannot act and requires external care for nourishment if sustained.\n\nYour freed consciousness retains your mental abilities, skills, and defenses but has no physical ability scores, stamina, or wounds. It is undetectable and immune to normal physical attacks.\n\nYou may instantly move to any spot you can see within a number of Areas equal to your Power Score modifier, up to a maximum range of your Power Score in Areas. Moving beyond this range requires additional Power Checks (DC 15 for normal pace, DC 20 to pass through barriers).\n\nAlternatively, you may teleport to a previously visited location with a Power Check:\n\n-   DC 15 — very familiar and emotionally charged\n-   DC 20 — familiar but neutral\n-   DC 30 — visited only once\n\nYou cannot project to places you’ve never been, and magical or powered barriers may block you. At the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, you may spend a Plot Point to reach someone important to you in a dramatic moment, even without knowing their location.\n\nIf your projected form suffers damage, it snaps back to your body. You must then make a DC 20 Wisdom save or take a wound from the shock (watch for foes with *Third Eye* or *Spirit Seeker*).\n\nReturning to your body voluntarily is a free action and requires no roll. While projected, you can observe but cannot physically interact or use powers, except via the *Poltergeist* trick.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Power Tricks:* Manifestation, Poltergeist\n\n\\<side bar\\>  \n\\<h4\\>Power Trick: Manifestation\n\n**Associated Power**: Free Consciousness  \n**Cost:** 2 Burnout  \n**Effect:** While in your astral state, you can partially manifest in the physical world, making yourself faintly visible and audible to creatures in your immediate area.\n\nYou appear as a ghostly silhouette or outline and can speak to others (your voice sounds like a whisper or echo). You can also choose to make yourself recognizable to allies or intimidate foes (Editor-in-Chief may call for a Charisma Challenge if used to sway or frighten others). You cannot physically interact with objects or deal damage while manifested. This effect lasts until the end of your turn. You may maintain it on subsequent turns by paying 1 Burnout at the start of each turn.\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Power Trick: Poltergeist\n\n**Associated Power:** Free Consciousness  \n**Cost:** 2 Burnout  \n**Effect:**  \nWhile in your astral state, you can exert force on small objects in the physical world, mimicking the classic “poltergeist” phenomenon.\n\nYou may:\n\n-   Move, shake, or throw unattended objects weighing up to 10 lbs. per Power Score modifier.\n-   Slam doors, tip over chairs, or scatter papers to create noise or distraction.\n-   Hurl a single small object as an improvised ranged attack (Power Check vs Avoidance).\n\nObjects moved or thrown this way never inflict significant damage, but may disorient or frighten targets (Editor-in-Chief may call for a Challenge to determine impact on the scene). You can maintain poltergeist activity for 1 round per use of the Trick.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Geospatial Shift\n\nInterruptible\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Burnout:** 10\n\n*You can vanish from one location and appear miles away in another.*\n\n**Effect:** This power allows you to teleport yourself and anything or anyone you can carry a number of miles equal to your power score with just a thought, appearing in an unoccupied space. However, the minimum distance you can travel using this power is one mile.\n\n| Power Score  | Distance                   |\n|--------------|----------------------------|\n| 10-20        | power score in miles       |\n| 21-29        | power score x 10 in miles  |\n| 30-39        | Power score x 100 in miles |\n| 40+          | Anywhere on earth          |\n\n**Power Tricks**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Teleport, Portal\n\n*Power Trick:* Along for the ride\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Power Trick: Along for the ride\n\nYou can bring others with you when you teleport\n\n**Powers:** Geospatial Shift, Teleport\n\n**Cost:** +2 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** When you teleport, you can bring a number of passengers equal to half your power score modifier.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Glide\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Dexterity\n\n**Burnout:** 2\n\n*You possess the incredible ability to glide through the air, giving you an advantage in aerial combat and mobility.*\n\n**Effect:** In combat, you gain the ability to glide through the air with a fly pace equal to half your power score modifier; out of combat, you can glide your full power score modifier. Regardless, you must move a minimum of half your fly pace; you cannot gain altitude while gliding; you lose 1 area of height per turn.\n\nYou can control your descent rate and direction while gliding, allowing you to maneuver through tight spaces or land safely from great heights.\n\n**Note:** This power differs from the Flight power in that it does not grant the ability to gain altitude or hover in place.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Flight\n\n*Power Tricks:* Thermal Updraft\n\n\\<Sidebar\\>\n\n### Power Trick: Thermal Updraft\n\n**Powers:** Glide\n\n**Cost:** 2 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** While gliding, paying 2 Burnout, you can use your gliding ability to catch and ride thermal updrafts, gaining 1 area of altitude, allowing you to remain aloft for longer periods of time.\n\n\\</Sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Gravity Control\n\nRanged, Scene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Attack:** Fortitude\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You can alter the pull of gravity. You can root objects and people in place or cause them to float away.*\n\n**Effect:** This power has two aspects: increasing and decreasing gravity's pull on a target.\n\n**Increase Gravity:** By successfully hitting a target with a power attack roll, you can amplify the pull of gravity. You can gently apply this effect, dealing no damage, or violently crush the target, dealing your power’s base die in kinetic damage. Regardless, the target’s weight increases by an amount equal to the Max Lift value for this power’s score. If this added weight is below the target’s Max Lift, their pace is halved until the end of your next turn. If the weight reaches twice their Max Lift, they also suffer Disadvantage on melee attacks. At four times their Max Lift, they become immobile. This effect can also make an object too heavy to move or lift.\n\n**Decrease Gravity:** You can reduce a target's weight by an amount equal to the Max Lift value of the power's rank. Anyone attempting to lift the target applies their Strength against the new weight. If the weight is reduced to zero, the target becomes easily movable. Note that massive, weightless objects can still pose a danger. If an object is pushed out of your power’s range, it breaks free of this power but may have to deal with a sudden drop to the ground.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Flight, Glide, Move Object\n\n### \\<h3\\>Growth\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Constitution\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Burnout:** 6\n\n*You can increase your overall size.*\n\n**Effect:** When you activate this power, you increase your Size Category up to the maximum allowed by your Power Score (see table below). You choose how many categories to grow up to that maximum.\n\nFor each size category, you increase:\n\n-   Your Strength score increases by +2.\n-   Your Avoidance defense decreases by −1.\n-   Your mass doubles.\n-   Your melee attack reach and other effects scale with your new Size Category (see *Creature Sizes*, pg. XX).\n-   You may end this effect at any time as a bonus action.\n\nExample: A hero with a Growth Power Score Modifier of 25 can grow up to 3 size categories (from Medium to Large to Huge to Gargantuan). They could choose to grow only 1 or 2 steps if desired. They gain +2 Strength per size category, lose −1 Avoidance per size category, and gain the narrative and mechanical benefits and drawbacks associated with their new Size Category.\n\nSee Creature Sizes pg. XX for additional effects like reach of melee attacks.\n\n| Power Score | Number of Size Categories |\n|-------------|---------------------------|\n| 10-16       | 1                         |\n| 17-24       | 2                         |\n| 25-32       | 3                         |\n| 33-39       | 4                         |\n| 40+         | 5                         |\n\n### \\<h3\\>Heal\n\nInterruptible **  \nPrimary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Action/Special\n\n**Burnout:** 8\n\n*You can heal others with but a touch.*\n\n**Effect:** with a touch you can heal a creature in the following ways.\n\n-   Healing Stamina: Roll your Power Score base die and add your Primary Ability modifier; the target regains that much stamina.\n-   Removing a Condition: You may remove one of the following conditions: blindness, defined, poisoned, or unconscious. If this condition were applied using a power, you must make a Power Check against that power's passive value. Permanent conditions that were the results of natural events or Disease require a DC: 20 power check; this may only be attempted once, and you can again increase your power rank.\n-   Removing a Disease requires a DC: 20 power check; this may only be attempted once, and you can again increase your power rank. You can NOT heal the Z’virus, even with a power stunt.\n-   Healing a Wound, which takes 1 minute and requires a DC 30 Power Check. You can only heal a wound once, recovering the ability to do so after completing a Hiatus.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Power Tricks:* heal the psyche, healing burst.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Power Trick: Healing Burst\n\n*You release a burst of healing energy, healing your allies.*\n\n**Powers:** Heal\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Cost:** +4 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** Heal a number of friendly creatures in your Area and adjacent Areas equal to half your Power Score modifier. Distribute a pool of stamina equal to twice your Power Score among those healed.\n\n*If your editor-in-chief utilizes the optional psychosis and madness rules in chapter XX, the following power tick becomes available.*\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Power Trick: Heal the psyche.\n\nYou can heal trauma suffered by others.\n\n**Powers:** Heal, Telepathy\n\n**Action:** 1 hour\n\n**Cost:** +3 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** This power stunt removes 1 level of psychosis. An individual can only benefit from this power once during a Hiatus.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Illusion\n\nInterruptible, Range\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence\n\n**Attack:** Special. See below\n\n**Speed:** Demanding\n\n**Burnout:** 4/1\n\n*You can create illusions to confuse or delight others.*\n\n**Effect:** You create a visible illusion of any object, creature, or scene you can clearly imagine. The illusion is purely visual; no sound, smell, texture, or motion beyond what is believable for a static or looping image.\n\n1.  The illusion must be created in your line of sight and within a number of Areas equal to your Power Score divided by 3 (rounded down).\n2.  The illusion’s total volume cannot exceed the number of cubic Areas equal to power score bonus.\n3.  Maintaining the illusion requires a Bonus Action for each turn, costing 1 Burnout, or 2 Burnout if maintaining more than one illusion at a time or making rapid changes.\n4.  Creatures who interact directly with the illusion must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw against your Passive Power DC to recognize it as false.\n5.  A creature that succeeds automatically disbelieves further illusions you create until the end of the scene unless significantly altered.\n6.  If the illusion would clearly defy physics (e.g., floating rocks, walking fire), targets receive Advantage on the saving throw.\n\n**Special (Mastery):**  \nEvery 3 ranks in the Illusion power, choose one additional sense (sound, smell, touch, taste) to incorporate into your illusions. These added effects remain subtle and secondary; they serve to support the illusion but cannot replicate full effects of other powers (e.g., a “fire illusion” that feels warm can’t deal actual fire damage).\n\n**Special:**  \nDespite being mind-affecting, zombies *are* susceptible to Illusion, as it triggers base instincts such as hunger or fear. However, they never gain Disadvantage on saves and will not be fooled by overly complex or abstract illusions (Editor’s discretion).\n\n### \\<h3\\>Imbue Consciousness\n\nInterruptible, Melee, Scene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Charisma\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Burnout:** 8\n\n*You can grant an object sentience for a limited time.*\n\n**Effect:** You imbue an object with a rudimentary mind. You gain a pool of points equal to your Power Score modifier + Charisma modifier, which you may distribute among the object’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores and any skills you already possess.\n\nYou may split these points among multiple objects if desired.\n\nYou can enhance an object further by sacrificing your own ability scores, point-for-point, in the same ability. Lost ability points return at the rate of 1 per scene once the object’s consciousness ends.\n\nIf you assign no points to:\n\n-   Intelligence: the object cannot think independently and only follows simple commands.\n-   Wisdom: it is unaware of its surroundings.\n-   Charisma: it cannot respond or express itself.\n\nThis power does not grant the object senses, movement, or physical interaction; you must combine it with Animate Object to achieve that. This power only affects non-living, non-sentient objects; zombies and other undead are considered living for the purpose of this power.\n\n**Special (Combining Effects):** You can combine this power with Animate Object and Imbue Consciousness, using both powers simultaneously, for 10 burnout.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Incorporeal\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Bonus Action\n\n**Burnout:** 8\n\n*You can move through solid matters.*\n\n**Effect:** When you activate this power, you and anything you’re touching, up to half of your power score’s maximum lift, become incorporeal. This includes your clothes, belongings, or even another person. Anything you let go of immediately becomes solid again. While incorporeal, you can’t touch or interact with anything that wasn’t phased with you, though you can fly at your normal walking pace.\n\nFor each activation of this power, you can stay incorporeal for a number of turns equal to half your power score modifier (minimum of one),\n\n**Moving Through Matter:**  \nYou can pass through solid objects as long as your power score is at least as high as the material strength of the object. If it’s not, you can attempt a power check to force your way through, with the difficulty based on the difference.\n\nWhen you move through solid matter, your pace is cut in half. If you try to move faster, you take stamina damage equal to half the material strength of the object you’re passing through.\n\nNormally, you can’t move through active energy fields at all, but you can try by taking a demanding action while making a power check against the power rating of the field.\n\n**Risks and Vulnerabilities:**\n\nIf something becomes solid while overlapping with a solid object, like you or something you’re carrying, it suffers stamina damage equal to the object’s material strength and is violently pushed into the nearest open space.\n\nWhile you’re incorporeal, you’re harder to hurt by physical attacks, taking only half damage from them. However, energy-based attacks still hit you normally.\n\n**Special:**  \nWhile incorporeal, you’re also considered to have the invisibility (touch) power at a score equal to this power’s score.\n\nFor example, if you possessed Incorporeal: 25, you could remain incorporeal for 7 turns and pass through Steel Alloys (MS: 25) but would be required to make a DC: 15 Power Check to pass through Titanium (MS: 30) and a DC: 15 Power Check to pass though DH3 Palladium Metallic Glass (MS: 40)\n\n\\<Story\\>\n\nIn the early days after Z-Day, many incorporeal Heroes made the mistake of thinking they were invulnerable to the zombie plague. They were wrong.\n\n\\</story\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>**Inventive Gadgetry**\n\n**Primary Ability:** Intelligence\n\n**Action:** Special (See below)\n\n**Burnout:** As per power chosen.\n\n*You possess the remarkable ability to create functional gadgets out of what others would consider junk.*\n\n**Effect:** You can create gadgets that replicate a single power at a power rank equal to your power score. Gadgets are commonly handheld but may be larger depending on the item's intended use, which is determined by the editor-in-chief. All gadgets you build are considered to have the *removable item* and either *external power source* or *limited uses*, depending on how you built it. You don’t gain bonuses for these flaws.\n\nYou can only have one active gadget per instance of this power. If you build a new gadget, the old one is destroyed.\n\nWhen someone else tries to use one of your gadgets without you showing them how (requiring time over an enclave interlude), they roll at disadvantage.\n\n**  \nBuilding a Gadget   \n**There are three ways to use your power to create a gadget.\n\n-   *Taking my time:* **In those rare instances where you have an extended period to create a gadget, you may spend 8 hours creating one with the removable power flaw. Items made in this manner can be maintained indefinitely with regular maintenance. You must spend 4 hours per day maintaining the gadget. Not doing so will cause the gadget to stop working 24 hours after it was created or maintained.**\n-   *Give me time to think:* **If you create a gadget over 4 uninterrupted hours, it can be used 3 times, after which it burns out and becomes worthless.**\n-   *Just give me a minute:* **If you have the right materials, you can create a gadget on the fly. By spending 1 minute, you may create a gadget that works for only 1 use, after which the gadget burns out, becoming worthless.**\n\n**Materials: The quality of the materials you have at hand determines what you can build and how dependable it is. The editor-in-chief determines the quality of materials you have to work with at the moment you’re making your gadget.**\n\n-   *Inadequate materials:* **When working with inadequate materials, you can still put something together, but have no idea how it works. Your gadget has an unreliable power flaw (you gain no benefit from this flaw), and its power score is reduced by 2, the item cannot be maintained.**\n-   *Barely Adequate Materials:* **This is the baseline after Z-Day unless you have been gathering materials and have a safe and secure place to store it all. Items created with such limited resources have their power score reduced by 2**\n-   *This is perfect!* **In the rare cases where you have just the right parts for the gadget you're working on, you might create something that won’t fall apart. If the gadget you created has limited uses, its power score is increased by 2. If you took 8 hours to make your gadget and maintained it for 10 days, you may make it a permanent item (see emulated powers below) as if you had mastered a new power stunt.**\n\n**Reusing Materials: Depending on the gadget's power and how it was used, you may or may not be able to recover materials to make future gadgets; the editor-in-chief has the discretion to do so**.\n\n**Special (Power Modifications):** With the exception of the All-Skills power modification, you cannot apply any power modifications to this power.\n\n**Special (Inventive Gadgetry: Create Magical Items):** More mystic heroes can take Inventive Gadgetry to represent the creation of magical items such as staffs, totems, fetishes, and scrolls, in which case, the items required may be rarer than those required by its more technological adaptation. Additionally, items created through the *Taking My Time* option do not have the external power source modification. Instead, they tap into your arcane power; as such, you pay the burnout cost when activating the item's power.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Permanent Gadget:* Once you have maintained a gadget for 5 enclave interludes, you may take the Master Emulated Power feat to make it a permanent gadget that functions like an *emulated power.* These gadgets possess both the *external power source* and the *removable item power* modification (unless it’s a magical item, see above), which are treated as individual items and are not destroyed when you create a gadget with this power. You may destroy a permanent gadget when creating a new one if you need the suitable materials. If a permanent gadget is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced by building a new one between issues.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Invisibility\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Bonus Action/Reaction\n\n**Burnout:** Sight: 4 for sight/ All Others: 3\n\n*You can fool one of the senses.*\n\n**Effect:** When you activate this power, you become undetectable to a specific sense: *sight, smell, hearing, mental detection, or technology*.\n\nWhile active, anyone attempting to detect you through the affected sense must meet a Challenge using an appropriate Skill Set (such as Urban Hunter, Masked Detective, or Tracker), rolling against your passive Power DC. If they possess a sensory power that applies, they make a Power Check instead.\n\nIf someone has a sensory power with a power score at least 10 higher than your Invisibility score, they automatically detect you if you are in the same Area.\n\nAt the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, you may be required to roll a Power Check to remain undetected under particularly difficult circumstances (like staying invisible in falling snow or under UV light).\n\nIf detected, the observer knows your exact location if they’re in the same Area, or which Area you’re in if they’re not.\n\n**Reaction Activation:**  \nYou may activate this power as a reaction when detected, but doing so costs +3 burnout, and you suffer a -5 penalty to any Power Checks to remain undetected until the start of your next turn.\n\n**Choosing a Sense:**  \nWhen you select this power, choose one sense to which it applies. Each additional sense is purchased as a separate instance of the power.\n\nIf you have multiple senses covered, you may activate and maintain them together as if they were one power, at no additional burnout cost.\n\nTo avoid being detected by touch, you must possess the *Incorporeal power.*\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Chameleon (same type)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Invulnerability\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Constitution\n\n*You are invulnerable to a type of damage or condition*\n\n**Effect:** When you acquire this power, choose a specific type of energy, mental attack, or condition.\n\n-   **Invulnerability: Damage Category:** You gain DR equal to your power score modifier against that specific damage category.\n-   **Invulnerability: Damage type:** You gain DR equal to +6, your power score modifier against that specific damage type.\n-   **Invulnerability: Mental attacks:** You gain DR equal to +6, your power score modifier, against attacks that deal psychic damage, such as Psychic Attack Power. When resisting the effects of powers such as Mind Control, you gain a bonus to your defenses and saving throws equal to half your power score modifier (minimum of +1). You may “drop” your resistance against mental powers to allow someone to affect you, such as allowing an ally to establish telepathic communication.\n-   **Invulnerability: Condition:** You gain a bonus to your defenses or saving throws to resist the application of a chosen condition equal to half your power score modifier (minimum of +1).\n\nYou can utilize this power multiple times, selecting different energy types, each of which is tracked separately as its own power.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Leaping\n\n*Continuous*  \n**Primary Attribute:** Strength or Dexterity  \n**Burnout:** 2 (only when enhancing leap)\n\n*You can launch yourself with superhuman force, covering incredible distances and heights.*\n\n**Effect:**  \nYou can leap much farther and higher than normal. When you meet a Challenge that involves jumping, you add your power score modifier to the roll.\n\nYour base jump distance in Areas is equal to half your power score modifier (minimum of 1) horizontally and one-quarter your power score modifier vertically. These distances assume you have room for a running start; standing jumps reduce the distance by half.\n\nYou can also perform a dramatic, enhanced leap by spending 2 burnout, doubling your horizontal and vertical distance for that jump.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Life Support\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n*Your powers keep you safe from most environmental threats.*\n\n**Effect:** In its base form, Life-Support protects you from increasingly deadly environmental conditions as you increase your power score. This power allows you to operate in hostile environmental conditions for some time; you can persist beyond this limitation with a successful DC: 30 Power Check; once you reach a power score of 40, you may survive in hostile environments indefinitely without the need for air, food, or water.\n\n| Score | Environmental Conditions                                                                                  |\n|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 10-13 | Immune to common environmental conditions such as cold or heat.                                           |\n| 14-17 | Can breathe underwater                                                                                    |\n| 18-21 | High Pressure/Low Pressure - effects of water pressure and the bends operate perfectly at high altitudes. |\n| 22-25 | Not affected by gases                                                                                     |\n| 26-29 | Immune to poisons and toxins                                                                              |\n| 30-35 | Immune to high radiation levels                                                                           |\n| 36    | Can exist in the vacuum of space, or the pressure and cold of the deepest sea trenches.                   |\n\nAlthough you may not be immune to a condition until you reach a particular score, if you are exposed to a harmful environment, you may, at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, attempt a Power Check against a DC equal to the maximum power score required to survive in that environment, if successful your power protects you for a number of turns equal to your power score modifier.\n\nAlternatively, you can limit this power to underwater environments when selecting it. +10 point increase your starting power score, but your power only operates when you are submerged underwater.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Luck\n\n**Primary Ability:** Charisma\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You were just born lucky.*\n\n**Effect:** You gain a pool of luck points equal to half your power score modifier. Until you use all your luck points, your burnout threshold is reduced by 5. You may spend a point to roll any attack roll, saving throw, or roll to meet a challenge with Advantage.\n\n**Special (Luck is a…):** If you roll two 1s on any roll, or your attacker rolls two 20s on an attack roll, this power temporarily stops working until you complete a Hiatus, after which your burnout threshold returns to normal.\n\n**Special story impact:** Heroes with this power find themselves in the embrace of fickle fate. While not quite a flaw, you and the Editor-in-Chief are encouraged to emphasize this aspect. Things either go incredibly well for you or become one of \"those\" days. This theme doesn't affect the power itself, but should be a consistent element of your experience.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Manifest Gear\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence\n\n**Action:** Bonus\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*You always seem to have just the gadget you need. Maybe you create a biological version of the gadget, maybe you have Nano-bots injected into your skin that allow you to create temporary items on the fly, or maybe you just have a very handy utility belt you keep well stocked.*    \n**Effect:** At the start of each Issue, you gain a pool of temporary acquisition points equal to your power score modifier (minimum 1).\n\nAs a bonus action, you can manifest a single piece of equipment, spending its AP cost from your temporary pool. These points do not carry over from one issue to another.\n\nAny equipment you manifest is single-use only; if you don’t use it by the end of the scene, it becomes useless. Weapons include enough ammo for one scene, and batteries are charged for a single scene as well.\n\n**Special (Unique Power Modification Limitation: All-Skill):** If this is an All-Skill power, then any equipment manifested must be small enough to be carried on the Hero’s person reasonably.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Mimic\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 5/2\n\n*You can mimic another’s powers.*\n\n**Effect:**  \nChoose an origin (for example, Super-Human or Mystical). You can duplicate the power of someone with that origin as long as they are within a number of areas equal to your power score modifier.\n\nYou may only mimic one power at a time. The copied power functions at the lower of the target’s power score or your own Mimic power score, and you gain it with all its flaws and perks, but none of the target’s developed Power Stunts.\n\nYou can only copy or recall a power while its source remains within range. If the source leaves your range, you immediately lose access to the mimicked power.\n\nOn your turn, you can stop mimicking one power and start mimicking another as a bonus action.\n\nThe first time you mimic a new power from a new source in a scene; you pay 5 burnout. If you mimic a power, you’ve already copied earlier from the same source, the cost is only 2 burnout.\n\n**Special (Multiple Origins and Activation):** You can take this power multiple times, each instance letting you mimic an additional power at a time. For every two instances, you can also mimic powers from an additional origin.\n\nIf you have multiple instances of this power, they can all be activated simultaneously, as if they were one power, with no additional burnout cost.\n\n**For example**, KopyKat, who possesses Mimic: 28, sees Velocity use his Burst power for the first time. On his next action, he pays 5 burnout and acquires Burst as one of the powers, but at Velocity’s power score of 20. Later that day, KopyKat can recall that power for 2 burnout, Velocity is within range, which he retains for the remainder of the scene or until he recalls a different power.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Power Trick:* Power Roster   \n  \n\\<side bar\\>  \n**Power Trick: Power Roster**\n\n**Associated Power:** Mimic  \n**Cost:** +5 Burnout  \n**Action:** Bonus Action\n\nYou’ve developed a mental “roster” of powers you can call on even when their source is long gone.\n\nWhen you successfully mimic a power, you can choose to permanently add it to your roster by paying an additional 5 burnout and spending a bonus action.\n\nYou can store a number of powers in your roster equal to half your power score modifier (minimum of 1). If your roster is full, you can replace an existing power with the new one.\n\nAny power in your roster can be recalled at any time (as per normal Mimic rules), even if the original source is no longer nearby.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Mind Control\n\nInterruptible, Melee, Range\n\n**Primary Ability:** Charisma *or* Intelligence\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Attack:** Willpower\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*A favorite of supervillains, you can force others to do your bidding.*\n\n**Effect:** On a successful attack, you seize control of your target’s mind. The controlled creature is *charmed (psionic)* and obeys your commands for the rest of the scene.\n\nAt the end of each of their turns, the controlled target may attempt a Wisdom saving throw against your passive Power DC to break free. The Editor-in-Chief may apply a +1 to +6 bonus to this roll if your commands go against the target’s nature.\n\nA creature that breaks free knows it was controlled and may know who was responsible, depending on how the control was exerted.\n\nYou can control up to half your Power Score modifier in targets, paying the Burnout cost separately for each. When controlling multiple targets, you may issue the same command to all simultaneously.\n\n**Note:** Zombies are completely immune to Mind Control.\n\n**Power Stunts**:\n\n*Power Tricks:* Influence the Masses, Summon Animal, Modify Memory\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>\n\n#### Mental Powers\n\nMental powers (such as Mind Control, Emotion Control, and Telepathy) only work against sentient creatures, which may include highly advanced androids. However, such beings commonly possess Resistance (mental).\n\nMental powers do not work on Zombies or non-sentient robots.\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Move Object\n\nRange (Passive)\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom *or* Charisma\n\n**Action:** Complex\n\n**Attack:** Avoidance\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You can move objects at a distance with your force of will. Whether through telekinesis or the manipulation of magnetic forces, the results are the same.*\n\n**Effect:** Until the end of your next turn, you can manipulate objects or creatures within range, causing them to move at a speed equal to half your power score modifier and with a strength equal to your power score. You can handle multiple objects simultaneously by dividing your power score among them. For instance, if you have Move Object 22, you can move two objects as long as you can lift them with Move Object 11 (allowing you to manipulate two objects weighing up to 200 lbs. each).\n\nOnce you reach a power score of 20, you gain the ability for fine manipulation. You can use Move Object to perform physical tasks at a distance, though you do so with a disadvantage.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Flight, Personal Force Field, Force Shield, Energy Blast (Kinetic), Entangle.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Multiple Limbs\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Strength or Dexterity\n\n*You have more than the normal number of limbs.*\n\n**Effect:** You may manifest extra limbs equal to your Power Score ÷ 10 (minimum 1). The total Strength available to these limbs equals your Power Score, which you divide among them.\n\n**Example:** A Power Score of 20 allows you to manifest 2 limbs, each with a Strength of 10.\n\nWhen meeting a Challenge where extra limbs apply, you can describe how they assist you and gain the following benefits based on what you manifest:\n\n-   **Arms/Tentacles:** Wield multiple two-handed weapons, carry a weapon and a shield simultaneously, or handle more objects. You gain Advantage on grapple Challenges and add your Power Score modifier to Athletics Challenges and your Strength score to lift/drag calculations.\n-   **Legs:** Increase your Pace by 1 per extra leg, and add your Power Score modifier to resist knockback Challenges.\n-   **Tail:** Add your Power Score modifier to Athletics Challenges for balance. If prehensile, it can hold objects or even support your weight if its allocated Strength is sufficient.\n-   **Wings:** you gain the glide power at half this power's power score, you can use these wings to fly as an emulated power (see power stunts below)\n\n**Special (Power Modification):**  \n*Limitation (+4):* You may limit this power to only one of the above options. If you do, increase your Power Score for this power by +4.\n\n**Power Stunts**  \n*Emulated Power:* Enhanced attack (growing claws), Fly (growing wings)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Nullify\n\nInterruptible, Range (Passive), Scene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom *or* Charisma\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Attack:** Discipline\n\n**Burnout:** 8/2\n\n*You can prevent others from using their powers.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose an origin (Alien or Super-Human, for example). You can shut down one of your target’s powers tied to that origin.\n\nMake a successful attack against the target’s Discipline. If you succeed, choose either:\n\n-   A specific power you know or have seen them use.\n-   Or a random power from that origin (Editor-in-Chief determines).\n\nThe target must be within half your Power Score modifier in Areas (minimum 1). If they leave this range, the nullified power immediately resumes. If they reenter your range during the same scene, you can reapply the nullification for only 2 Burnout, with no additional attack roll required.\n\n**  \nPower Stunt:**\n\n*Power Trick:* Learn how to nullify the powers of another origin, Nullify Multiple Powers.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Portal\n\nRange\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Burnout:** 6\n\n*You possess the ability to create and manipulate portals, allowing you to travel instantaneously between two points in space.*\n\n**Effect:** You can create a pair of connected portals. One of these portals can be opened anywhere within line of sight and within a number of areas equal to your power score modifier. The other needs to be within line of sight or a location you have been to up to a maximum number of miles equal to your power score modifier.\n\nOnce the portals are created, you or any creature can use one portal to step through and emerge from the other portal, instantly transporting it to the corresponding location. Each portal remains active for a scene or until you dismiss them as a free action.\n\nCreatures and objects caught between portals when they close are ejected at one end of the portal or the other, depending on which side they were mostly on.\n\nPortals can only be created in an unoccupied space within an area. These portals are generally the size of a medium-sized creature, but you may create larger portals depending on your power score.\n\n| Power Score | Maximum Portal Size |\n|-------------|---------------------|\n| 10-24       | Medium              |\n| 25-32       | Large               |\n| 33-39       | Huge                |\n| 40+         | Gargantuan          |\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\nPortals and Combat: Utilizing portals in combat demands precision and timing. A character attempting to attack or reach through a portal suffers a -4 penalty to their attack or face-offs due to the distorted perspective and unpredictable spatial interaction. Larger objects or creatures might not fit through smaller portals at the Editor-In-Chief’s discretion.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Teleportation, Geospatial Shift, Deflection (use a portal to deflect damage)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Poison\n\nContinuous, Melee *or* Range (0)\n\n**Primary Ability:** Constitution\n\n**Action:**  Special, See below\n\n**Attack:** Special, Fortitude\n\n*You possess a poisonous attack.*\n\n**Effect:** When this power is first chosen, you must choose the way you deliver the poison into the target’s system.\n\n-   **Poison Spit:** You spit poison at a target in your Area. Make a ranged attack against Avoidance, with a penalty (–2 to disadvantage) based on how much exposed skin the target has. If you hit, make a Power Check against the target’s Fortitude. On success, deal your power’s base die in poison damage, and the target gains *Weakened (Poison, Ability Rolls and Attack Rolls)*. for a number of turns equal to your Power Score modifier. At the end of each of their turns, the target can make a Constitution save against your passive Power DC to end the condition. *If this option is chosen, increase your Power Score for this power by +4.*\n-   **Poison Touch:** You deliver poison through direct contact. Make a melee attack against Avoidance, with the same penalties for covered targets as above. If you hit, make a Power Check against your target’s Fortitude. On success, resolve effects as above. *If this option is chosen, increase your Power Score for this power by +4.*\n-   **Poisonous Attack:** You must combine this power with the *Enhanced Melee Attack* power. Whenever you hit and deal damage exceeding the target’s DR, make a Power Check against the target’s Fortitude. Upon success, the target gains *Weakened (Poison, Ability Rolls and Attack Rolls)*.\n-   **Area Attack:** You release poisonous pheromones into your Area as an action. Make a Power Check against the Fortitude for each creature in the Area. On success, each suffers your power’s base die in poison damage and becomes poisoned. If chosen, reduce your Power Score for this power by 2.\n\nReapplying poison does not stack damage but resets the poison’s duration. Each successful reapplication imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to the target’s Constitution checks to end the poisoned condition.\n\n**Special (Resistance - Poison):** You are immune to your poison and are considered to possess Resistance: Poison equal to your power score.\n\n**Special (Alternate Non-Damaging Effect):** Alternately, you can have the poison not deal damage or grant the poisoned condition, but instead deal a Secondary Effect as per the Power Modification.\n\n**Special (Synergy):** You may take the synergy power modification, synergizing Poison and Weaken.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Weaken (via the same method as poison)\n\n**\\<Side bar\\>**\n\n### Using Poison in the Game\n\nThe Poison Power can be used for all types of poison; for example, a poisonous spider may have Poison 12.\n\n**\\</Side bar\\>**\n\n### \\<h3\\>Possession\n\nMelee, Scene, Ranged\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Charisma or Intelligence\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Attack:** Discipline\n\n**Burnout:** 8\n\nYou can displace your consciousness into the minds of others, taking control of their bodies. This power allows you to project your mental abilities and skills onto the target while retaining their physical abilities. However, the Editor-in-Chief has the final say on which powers are retained based on their intuitive nature. It's important to note that possession leaves your true body defenseless against other possession attempts.\n\nUpon a successful attack, your consciousness merges with the target's, replacing their Mental ability scores and Skills with your own. You retain any inherent powers that can be used intuitively but may lose those that rely on training or skill. You retain limited control over your true body; you retain the ability to defend yourself, eat and drink, and move at your normal pace, but you cannot take further actions.\n\nOnce per scene, the creature you possess may attempt to expel you from their mind by succeeding on Charisma or Intelligence saving throw. The editor-in-chief may apply circumstance modifiers based on your actions and align them with the target's nature. Only one being can possess a target at a time, and if someone else successfully uses Possession, the first possessor is forced back into their own body.\n\n**Special (Incorporeal):** If this power is used while utilizing Free Consciousness, Incorporeal, Projection, or a similar power, your intangible form physically inhabits the creature you possess.\n\n**Special (Long-Term Possession):** Possession can continue from scene to scene if the Burnout cost is paid. The creature you possess can attempt to expel you from their mind once per scene with a successful Charisma or Intelligence saving throw. If a target remains possessed for 24 hours, they can only attempt their saving throw once daily. If possessed for a full month, they can only make a saving throw at the beginning of each Issue to attempt expulsion. At the Editor-in-Chief's discretion, if a Bystander remains possessed for over a month, it can be considered a permanent possession unless voluntarily vacated or forced out by others. You can return to your original body, at will, for a total number of days equal to your power score modifier (minimum of 1). If you do not return to your body after a number of days equal to your power score, your consciousness severs its connection with your body, resulting in its death. The fate of a consciousness forced out without a living body is beyond the scope of this book.\n\n**Special (Non-Humans):** Possession is not limited to targeting sentient beings. It can affect non-sentient animals with a brain, artificial intelligences, and the undead. However, non-animate corpses and non-sentient machinery are unaffected. It's worth noting that zombies are not immune to possession but require another attack roll every turn to maintain control. If a zombie remains possessed for a number of turns equal to or exceeding the possessor's Discipline, the insatiable hunger for flesh overwhelms them. At the Editor-in-Chief's discretion, those who possess a zombie long enough to experience this hunger may develop psychosis, temporary personality flaws, or even long-term madness to reflect mental derangement. Possessed zombies do not follow the rules for Long-Term Possession and cannot be possessed permanently. The nature of the Z-Virus only allows a zombie's consciousness to remain outside its body for a number of days equal to its power score modifier.\n\n### \\<H3\\>Power Boost\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Charisma\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 8\n\n*You can temporarily boost someone else’s powers.*\n\n**Effect:** Select an origin other than \"highly trained.\" You can boost a single power of an individual from that origin by increasing their power score by your power score modifier until the end of the scene, pushing powers even beyond their rank limit. Power boosts from different individuals do not accumulate; only the highest bonus applies. However, two individuals can each boost different powers possessed by the same individual.\n\n**Power Stunt:**\n\n*Power Trick:* learn how to boost the powers of another origin.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Precognition\n\nInterruptible\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Burnout:** 15\n\n*You possess the ability to see glimpses of the future. However, the question remains: are these visions certain outcomes or merely possibilities?*\n\n**Effect:** When using this power to see future events, make a Power check against a DC set by how far into the future you are attempting to see. Looking 24 hours ahead requires a DC 15 Power Check, a month ahead of DC 25, a year ahead of DC 30, and a decade or more ahead of DC 40+ or higher.\n\nIt's important to note that anything you see is predominantly a potential future, subject to the influence of fate, dice rolls, the actions of heroes, and the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief. The Editor-in-Chief may present possible futures that you may want to prevent or reveal the fate of bystanders. The context of what you see is often unclear. For instance, seeing someone \"dead\" doesn't necessarily mean they are truly deceased. They could be asleep, faking their death, only injured, a body double, or involved in some other deceptive circumstance.\n\n**Special (Unique Power Modifications):**\n\n*Reflective Precognition (-2):* Your subconscious taps into your precognitive abilities, granting a bonus to your initiative roll equal to your power score modifier (minimum of +1) when you spend 8 Burnout before the initiative is rolled.\n\n*Retrocognition (+0):* Instead of peering into the future, you can use this power to witness past events. In this case, the power works in reverse, requiring a successful DC 10 Power Check to see something that occurred within the past 24 hours, with higher DCs for events further back in time. As with Precognition, the visions lack context. However, the past is typically unchangeable and can be trusted to depict true events.\n\n*Psychometry (+2):* Activation of this power requires touching an object. You can then perceive possible futures or past events related to the object and anyone who may have possessed it.\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>\n\n**Seeing The Future**\n\nPrecognition and Retrocognition can be complex powers, and some Editors-in-Chief may choose to disallow them entirely. However, they can also serve as powerful storytelling tools. Consider granting heroes with precognition occasional flashes of the future, even when undesired, to plant seeds for future stories or guide them along the right path. Also, consider making visions of the future or past increasingly vague the further they are from the present. Retrocognition at a murder scene, for example, might reveal the murderer as a mere shadowy figure but provide details like the method of murder or the escape route.\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Psychic Attack\n\nDamaging, Ranged\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom or Charisma\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Attack:** Willpower\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You generate blasts of psychic power that can fry a man’s synapse.*\n\n**Effect:**  You manifest a blast of psychic energy in your opponent’s mind, dealing your power score’s base die in psychic damage. *Psychic* attacks are a particular case; due to their nature, *they ignore DR from any source that* does not explicitly protect against it. However, it also has no effect against zombies (even super zombies) unless they possess a weakness for psychic damage.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Telepathy, Mind Control, Super-Sense: Mental Detection.\n\n*Power Tricks:* Psychic Scream\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### Power Trick: Psychic Scream\n\n**Powers:** Psychic Attack\n\n**Cost:** +3 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** A Hero can attack all the minds in an adjacent area rather than attack a single mind.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Regeneration\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Constitution\n\n*You have a hyper-natural healing factor.*\n\n**Effect:** This power has several effects:\n\n-   You regain your power score modifier in Stamina at the end of your turn.\n-   You add your power score modifier to all Constitution saving throws to resist the effects of poisons and toxins or to end the poisoned condition.\n-   You can heal from normal disease and regrow a lost limb (requiring as long as healing a wound). Strangely, this power makes you more susceptible to the Z-Virus, reducing your Fortitude against being turned by half your power score modifier.\n-   If you suffer Wound damage, you stop regaining Stamina at an increased rate. You reduced the time needed to heal a wound by a number of hours equal to your power score modifier (minimum 1 hour). You can heal an additional wound after a Hiatus by making a wound recovery roll as usual, with a bonus equal to double your power score modifier.\n\nSo, for instance, if you possess Regeneration 22, you will automatically heal a wound every 18 hours. Also, after completing a Hiatus, you can then make a wound recovery roll with a +6 bonus to recover an additional wound.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Repulsion\n\nRange, Primary\n\n**Primary Ability:** Charisma\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Attack:** Discipline\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You can force a creature to flee from you.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose up to half your Power Score modifier in creatures within range. Pay 5 Burnout per creature, then make a Power Attack against each target’s Discipline Defense.\n\nOn a success, the target must avoid you by any means short of self-harm, remaining beyond this power’s range for minutes equal to your Power Score modifier.\n\nAt the end of each of their turns, affected creatures may make a Wisdom saving throw against your passive Power DC to end the effect.\n\n**Special (Limitation):** You may limit this power to only working on a particular creature type. Common creatures like zombies or broadly defined groups like the living are a +1 Flaw, while uncommon creatures or specific groups like demons or worshipers of the Elder Gods may be as high as +3.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Resistance\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Constitution\n\n*You possess a remarkable resilience to most forms of damage.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose one of the following damage sources: physical, energy, psychic, or damage from magical effects. You add your power score modifier to your Fortitude defense to resist massive damage when attacked by your chosen source. You may limit this power to a particular damage type (for example, Fire), in which case you increase this power’s score by +6\n\nThis power does not protect you against disease, poison, or environmental effects.\n\n**Special (Limitations):** You cannot choose a source of damage against which you are vulnerable or a fatal flaw against.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Shape Shift\n\nScene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Constitution or Intelligence\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You can change your form to look like someone else.*\n\n**Effect:** You can transform yourself to resemble someone you’ve personally met or directly observed, even via recordings. This change is purely physical and does not grant you their memories, powers, feats, or skills.\n\nWhen you meet a Challenge that involves impersonating someone, you may apply a relevant Skill Set (like *Master of Disguise*, *Con Artist*, or *Cult Figure*). Anyone familiar with your target may attempt a Challenge (using a Skill Set like *Masked Detective* or *Urban Hunter*) against your passive Power DC to notice something “off.” Noticing doesn’t necessarily mean they call you out; it may simply raise suspicion.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief may also require additional Challenges using appropriate Skill Sets to maintain the ruse under pressure, particularly when knowledge or behavior comes into play.\n\nOnce your power score reaches 20 or higher, and you’ve directly observed your target’s quirks and mannerisms, you may add your power score modifier as a bonus to your Skill Set rolls to maintain the disguise.\n\n**Special (Combining Effects, Mimic):**  You can combine this power with Mimic to take on someone else’s powers and physical appearance as a Demanding action. When doing so, you only pay one-half the Burnout to recall each power, rounded up.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* enhanced attack (growing claws), fly (growing wings), multiple limbs\n\n### \\<h3\\>Shrink\n\nScene\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*You reduce your size to slip through cracks, dodge attacks, or become almost impossible to hit, a living ghost in miniature.*\n\n**Effect:** When you activate this power, you decrease your Size Category by up to the maximum allowed by your Power Score (see table below). You choose how many categories to shrink, up to that maximum.\n\nFor each size category, you shrink:\n\n-   Your Strength score decreases by −2.\n-   Your Avoidance defense increases by +1.\n-   Your mass is halved.\n-   You gain the narrative and mechanical benefits and drawbacks of your new Size Category (see Creature Sizes, pg. XX).\n\nYou may end this effect at any time as a bonus action.\n\n**Optional:** When activating this power, you may spend an additional 4 Burnout to retain your full-Strength score regardless of how small you become.\n\n**Example:**\n\nYou can use your Shrink Power Score Modifier of 25 to shrink up to 3 size categories (from Medium to Small to Tiny to Smaller-than-Tiny). If you shrink all 3 steps, they suffer −6 Strength, gain +3 Avoidance, and take on the full narrative impact of being a fraction of their normal size. You can also choose to pay an additional 4 Burnout to keep their full Strength despite their size.\n\n| Power Score | Number of Size Categories |\n|-------------|---------------------------|\n| 10-16       | 1                         |\n| 17-24       | 2                         |\n| 25-32       | 3                         |\n| 33-39       | 4                         |\n| 40+         | 5                         |\n\n#### Editor-in-Chief, Remember:\n\n-   Heroes can shrink no smaller than a fraction of an inch (“smaller than Tiny”), but narrative plausibility still applies. At extreme reductions, the hero may no longer be able to meaningfully interact with the scene.\n-   As always, apply narrative consequences of being small, falling into vents, being trampled by zombies, having to climb everyday objects, etc.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Deflection (shrinking to get out of the way of an attack)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Sixth Sense\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n*You can sense when danger is just around the corner.*\n\n**Effect:** You cannot be surprised. Additionally, you gain a bonus to all defenses equal to your power score modifier against the first attack against you in any given scene or when someone attacks you that would have surprised you if it were not for this power.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Speed\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Dexterity\n\n*You are simply faster... much faster.*\n\n**Effect:** This power increases your Pace by your power score modifier. This power also grants you the ability to travel and maneuver with your power at high speeds safely; for example, you are not damaged by a sonic boom you created when running, or if you create sheets of ice to skate on, you’re not going to slip.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Temporal Fugue\n\n### \\<h3\\>Super-Sense\n\nContinuous, Range (Varies, see below)\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n*You can see things that others cannot.*\n\n**Effect:** Unlike Enhanced Senses, this power grants you either a new way of using one of your senses or a new one, such as the ability to detect the minds of others telepathically.\n\nWhen you choose this power, you must select one of the following super-senses.\n\n-   Hearing\n    -   Sonar\n    -   Super Hearing\n    -   Remote Listen\n-   Magical\n    -   Sense Magical Auras\n    -   Extradimensional Sensitivity\n-   Mental\n    -   Detect Minds\n    -   Head for numbers\n    -   Sense of Direction\n    -   Sense of Time\n    -   Speed Reading\n-   Sight\n    -   Low Light Vision\n    -   Night-Vision\n    -   Microscopic Vision\n    -   Telescopic Vision.\n    -   Thermal Vision\n    -   X-Ray Vision\n-   Smell\n    -   Tracking\n-   Technological\n    -   Sense Tech\n    -   Motion Sensor\n-   Touch\n    -   Hyper-touch\n\nYour senses’ range is equal to your power score modifier. The Editor-in-Chief may require you to make a Power Check in response to opposing powers or extraordinary conditions. You are limited to your normal vision range unless you possess Super-Sense (Telescopic Vision).\n\n**Hearing**\n\n-   *Sonar*: You can “see” soundwaves, creating a detailed three-dimensional picture of the surrounding area. Due to your heightened sensitivity to sound, attacks that utilize sound attack you with Advantage as long as this power is active.\n-   *Super-Hearing:* You can hear low and high frequencies, radar waves, or radio and television transitions. You gain a bonus to all Challenges based on hearing equal to your power score bonus due to your heightened sensitivity to sound; attacks that utilize sound attack you with Advantage as long as this power is active.\n-   *Remote Listen:* You can listen to sounds in an area a number of areas away equal to your power score modifier.\n\n**Magical**\n\n-   *Sense Magical Auras:* You can automatically feel the presence of active magical effects within a number of areas equal to half your power score modifier (minimum of the same area). Alternately, as an action, you can detect the presence of passive magical auras (emanating from magical items or even transcribed spells) or the lingering effects of magic use with a Power Check against a DC equal to the number of days since that magical event transpired. Once you reach a power score of 30, your sensitivity is such that you also automatically feel the presence of passive magical auras within your area.\n-   *Extradimensional Sensitivity:* a strangely unique and rare sense, you can automatically feel any extradimensional rift or transportation within a number of miles equal to your power score modifier. You can also sense the presence of extradimensional creatures within a number of areas equal to your power score modifier; you may be required to make a power score check against the creature’s discipline defense or power passive DC of a power an extradimensional creature is actively using in an attempt to hide its presence.\n\n**Mental**\n\n-   *Detect Minds:* As a bonus action, you can detect the presence of active minds, living creatures with an intelligence of 3 or more, within range. By using a demanding action, you can pinpoint the locations of all minds within range. You can also recognize the minds you know (friends and people you have met). The Editor-in-Chief may require a Power Check to recognize a mind you have not “seen” in a while; this sense is considered a Mental Power.\n-   *Head for Numbers:* You can do complex calculations in your head. In addition, the Editor-in-Chief may allow you to add the power score modifier to any appropriate challenge when making calculations, repairs, or building new equipment.\n-   *Sense of Direction:* You always know where north (or another set direction) is, making it difficult to get lost. You get a bonus equal to your Passive Modifier when making any Intelligence challenge to determine where you currently are or when trying to find your way out of a maze, navigate a suburban sprawl, remember the path you took to get where you are, and so on.\n-   *Sense of Time:* You always know the time and do not need a watch. This lets you know how much time you have left before sundown, how long you need to wait before springing an ambush, how long you need to leave something in the oven, and so on. It is a valuable skill in a world where working clocks and watches are becoming increasingly difficult to find each passing day.\n-   *Speed Reading:* You can easily read a page of material briefly and examine in a matter of minutes what might take other hours to read. Combined with Celerity, you can read large volumes as quickly as you can turn the pages.\n\n**Sight**\n\n-   *Low-Light Vision:* You can see normally in shadowy conditions and outdoors at night under a starlit sky or when the moon is bright. Additionally, the amount of detail you can perceive in such conditions is extraordinary. Add half your power score modifier to vision-based challenges under such conditions.\n-   *Night-Vision:* You can see in complete darkness up to a range equal to your power score modifier (minimum of the area you occupy). Additionally, the amount of detail you can perceive in such conditions is extraordinary. Add half your power score modifier to vision-based challenges under such conditions, but this comes at a cost. If you are exposed to bright lights when using your Night Vision, you are *Blinded (Total)*. until the end of your next turn.\n-   *Microscopic Vision:* You suffer no penalties on vision-based challenges up to the magnification level equal to the power’s score. This power can be used in conjunction with any other vision-based Super Sense.\n\n    Power Score of 10-13: x10 — can see fingerprints, 14-17: x50 — can see plankton. 18-19: x100 — can see individual cells and single-celled organisms such as amoeba. 20-25: x500 — can see internal cell structure. 26-29: x1,000 —can see objects measured in microns. 30-35 x5,000, 36-39 x10,000 40-45: x50,000, 46-49: x100,000, 50+: x500,000 — can see individual atoms.\n\n-   *Telescopic vision:* You suffer no penalties on *perception checks to a number of areas equal to the power score, which* may be used in conjunction with any other vision-based super sense.\n-   *Thermal Vision:* You can perceive the infrared spectrum, allowing you to see temperature differences in the area around you. Limited to half your power score modifier (minimum of the area you occupy), this power allows you to see in the dark, as well as perceive the heat signatures of any living target. However, it’s not so useful against the undead, whose body temperature closely matches the temperature of the area around them. As such, you gain a bonus (min +1) to vision-based challenges to see living creatures, but undead are *undetectable* when perceived through thermal vision.\n-   *X-ray vision:* You may only see through objects with a Material Strength equal to or less than your passive power DC.\n\n**Smell**\n\n-   *Tracking:* Choose a target who has passed through your current location within a number of days equal to your power score; you add a double power score modifier (min of +2) to all smell-based challenges when tracking that target.\n\n**Technological**\n\n-   *Sense Tech:* You can automatically feel the presence of active technological effects within a number of areas equal to your power score modifier (minimum of 1). Alternately, as an action, you can detect the presence of passive technology, such as acting in hibernation mode or low power settings, enough to blend into the background.\n-   *Motion Sensor:* You can detect motion up to a number of areas equal to your range. Any creature that moves more than 1 area per turn sets off your sensor, and you can pinpoint its exact location.\n\n**Touch**\n\n-   *Hyper-Touch*: You can “read the ink off pages by tracing your fingers over the words; as a bonus action, you can feel the air move around you, giving you the ability to detect movement in the same area in the right conditions. Additionally, as an action, you can touch the ground and feel movement within range and even pinpoint it with a successful Power Check with a DC equal to the MS of the material the movement is taking place on. For example, *Jaeger* takes a moment to touch the floor and feel out the building, possessing a Super Sense (Hyper-Touch): 20 he can “feel” up to 5 areas, rolling against the MS of concrete (DC: 20) he can sense the presence and pin-points the current location of 15 zombies scattered about on the floors above him.\n\n**Special (Access):** You may take this power multiple times, choosing a different sense each time, with each sense being tracked as its power. You may only have one super-sense active at any particular time; switching between them requires a bonus action.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* You can emulate a sense of the same sense group for which you have a power. For example, if you possess Super Sense (Sonar), you can learn Super Sense (Hyper-Hearing) as an emulated power.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Surge\n\n**Primary Ability:** Dexterity\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*You are capable of incredible bursts of speed.*\n\n**Effect:** When you acquire this power, you must choose a mode of movement: flying, jumping, running, or swimming.\n\nWhen utilizing your chosen movement mode, you increase your Pace by double your power score modifier until the end of your next turn. This power does not grant the ability to fly; it only gives you a boost of speed while flying if your chosen mode of movement is flight.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Temporal Fugue\n\n### \\<h3\\>Swinging\n\nScene **  \nPrimary Ability:** Dexterity\n\n**Burnout:** 2\n\n*You possess the incredible ability to swing from one point to another with incredible speed and precision.*   \n**Effect:**  \nYou can anchor yourself to a structure or object within a number of Areas equal to half your power score modifier (minimum 2). Your “swing line” has an MS equal to your passive power value and one hit.   \n  \nOnce anchored, you can:\n\n-   **Swing:** Move with a swing pace equal to your power score modifier, treated as flight for purposes of maneuverability. You cannot hover. If you use Swing as normal movement, you end your move standing on the ground. If you Dash while swinging, you may choose to remain “mid-swing” between turns.\n-   **Climb:** Climb up the anchored line at a pace equal to half your power score modifier.\n-   **Hang:** Simply, hang in place from the anchor, remaining stationary.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Entangle, Glide\n\n### \\<h3\\>Summon Animal\n\nScene, Ranged\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Charisma\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 5 + Special\n\n*You can summon aid from what is left in nature.*\n\n**Effect:** You summon an animal that appears at your side at the beginning of your next turn. The threat level of the animal you can summon is limited by your power score (see table below). You may use this ability to summon more than one animal at a time, up to a maximum equal to half your power score modifier, but at an additional burnout cost of +3 for each animal beyond the first. You can only use this power once per scene.\n\n| Threat Level Power  |           |\n|---------------------|-----------|\n| 10                  | Bystander |\n| 12                  | Hardened  |\n| 15                  | Zeta      |\n| 20                  | Epsilon   |\n| 25                  | Delta     |\n| 30                  | Gamma     |\n| 35                  | Beta      |\n| 40                  | Alpha     |\n\n\\<side Bar\\>  \nTech Heroes Summoning Animals\n\nAt first, you might think... wait… what? Remember, you can alter a power’s “flavor” to better fit your hero’s concept as long as the effects remain the same. So, while a Tech Hero would be limited to the more restrictive version of this power, they’re assumed to possess a mechanical version of whatever animal they wish to summon and have it readily available. In addition, you can even give these mechanical creatures a different form. For example, while you may choose wolves for your mechanical animals, they could look like mechanical pit bulls or even giant spiders instead! Just talk your ideas out with the Editor-in-Chief, and be creative in the spirit of shaping your Hero, not in trying to “break” the game\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Sympathy\n\nRanged\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Bonus\n\n**Attack:** Discipline\n\n**Burnout:** 2\n\n*You can sense the emotions of others.*\n\n**Effect:** Make a Power Attack against a target’s Discipline defense. If successful, you learn the dominant emotion present in your target. If the target is deliberately lying, this emotion will be deception, although other situations might also cause deception to be a dominant emotion. This is a mental power, and as such, it does not work on zombies or non-sentient targets.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Power Tricks:* Read the Crowd   \n  \n\\<Sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Power Trick\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Read the Crowd\n\n**Powers:** Sympathy\n\n**Cost:** +1 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** You can use your power to read the emotional state of a mob or determine the prevalent emotional state of all creatures within a number of areas equal to your power score modifier with a successful DC:20 power check.\n\n\\</Sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Telepathy\n\nRange, Scene\n\n**Primary Ability:** Charisma\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Attack:** Discipline\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You can read and transmit thoughts.*\n\n**Effect:** You can connect with another person’s mind and communicate. You can also read surface thoughts (making interrogations more effective). To connect with a person’s mind, you must have a willing subject or make a power attack against their Discipline defense to force the link. At the end of their turn, your target may attempt to sever the connection with a successful Charisma saving throw.\n\nZombies are considered mindless for purposes of telepathy, though there are disturbing rumors that Super Z’s with telepathic abilities are able to communicate with each other.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Psychic Attack, Force Field (against mental attacks only), Heal the Psyche, Mind Control, Super-Sense: Mental Detection, Sympathy\n\n*Power Tricks:* Link Minds*,* Mental Deep-Dive\n\n\\<Sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Power Tricks: Telepathy\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Link Minds\n\n**Powers:** Telepathy\n\n**Cost:** +3 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** You can form a telepathic link between a number of willing subjects equal to your power score modifier; all linked creatures communicate telepathically with each other and are aware of each other’s actions and condition.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Mental Deep Dive\n\n**Powers:** Telepathy\n\n**Cost:** +3 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** Once a telepathic link is established, you may attempt to delve deeper into the target's memories. To do so, you need to perform a second power attack roll against their Discipline defense; if successful, you can gleam into their memories and maybe find the information they are trying to keep from you. If your target is unaware, they know something of use to you, the editor-in-chief may require you to roll an Investigation (Intelligence) skill check as you shift through your target's memories.\n\n\\</Sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Teleport\n\nRange\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Action\n\n**Burnout:** 8\n\n*You can disappear and reappear, traversing the intervening distance without actually moving.*\n\n**Effect:** With a single thought, you can transport yourself and anyone or anything you can carry based on your strength score, a number of areas equal to your full range in areas.   \nAppearing in an unoccupied space in your target area. Depending on your power source, this transportation may involve going through alternate planes of reality or disassembling your molecules and moving at quantum speeds.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Geospatial Shift, Portal\n\n*Power Trick:* Along for the ride\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<H3\\>Power Stunt: Teleport Along for the ride\n\n**Powers:** Teleport\n\n**Cost:** +3 Burnout\n\n**Effect:** You can teleport a number of creatures with you equal to your power score modifier; you cannot teleport creatures more than one size category larger than you.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Temporal Fugue\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Dexterity\n\n**Action:** Action/Reaction\n\n**Burnout:** 5\n\n*You either move so fast or warp time around you, allowing you to enter a state known as “bullet time.”*\n\n**Effect:** You add your power score modifier to either your Avoidance *or* as a bonus to hit until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Power Stunts:**   \n*Emulated Power:* Celerity, Sixth Sense, Speed, Surge.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Translate\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence or Wisdom\n\n*You can speak and understand unknown languages*\n\n**Effect:** You can understand the intelligent speech of other beings and communicate understandably in their language, even if you do not share a common language. To understand them or be understood, make a Power Check with a difficulty level based on the complexity of the ideas to be communicated. Very simple ideas like “Danger, Zombies!” DC: 10. Typical ideas like “I greet you in peace” DC: 15. More complex ideas like complicated battle plans or philosophical ideas would be DC: 20 or more difficult. Languages related to one you speak naturally, such as the family of Romance languages, have their DC reduced by 10. Non-human languages, or truly cryptic dead languages like Enochian or Atlantean, have their DC increased by 5. This power does not enable you to communicate with beings that lack a language or the intelligence to understand one. However, at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, they may allow you to understand and communicate in non-verbal languages.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Tunnel\n\n**Primary Ability:** Strength\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*You can burrow through solids as if swimming.*\n\n**Effect:** As an action, you can dig through the ground at a burrow pace equal to your power score modifier. Your power score not only determines how far you can burrow, but also how you Burrow, as indicated below.\n\nPower Score\n\n-   **1-20:** You can pass through loose soil and gravel with ease.\n-   **21-25:** You can pass through tightly packed earth and stone, leaving a tunnel behind you.\n-   **30+:** You swim through the earth like a fish swims the sea, leaving no sign of passage.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Ultimate Skill\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Intelligence\n\n*You have a knack for a particular skill, almost inhumanly so.*\n\n**Effect:** Choose one Edge for a Skill Set you know. When you apply to that Edge to meet a Challenge, you gain an additional bonus equal to your power score modifier on the roll.\n\nYou may take this power multiple times, selecting a different Edge each time.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Weaken\n\nMelee or Range\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Dexterity or Charisma\n\n**Action: Action**\n\n**Attack:** Discipline (for Mental Ability Score) or Fortitude (for Physical Ability Scores)\n\n**Burnout:** 4\n\n*Your attacks weaken the attributes of your targets*\n\n**Effect:** When you first choose this power, choose an ability score. Upon a successful power attack roll, your target suffers a penalty to that ability score equal to your power score modifier; this power cannot decrease the score of an ability score below 1.\n\n**Special (Access):** You can take this power multiple times, choosing a different ability score, with each being tracked as its own power.\n\nYou may activate all versions of this power at once with no additional Burnout cost as long as they are attacking the same group of ability scores (Physical or Mental). Additionally, if you are attempting to affect both Physical and Mental ability scores at the same time, your power must overcome the higher of the target’s Discipline or Fortitude defenses.\n\n**Special (Linked):** If this power is *Linked* with another attack power, you may use both powers in tandem; when you do so, you only make an attack roll for the power to which weaken is linked to. If that attack roll hits and also overcomes the target’s Discipline (for Mental Attributes) or Fortitude (for Physical Attributes), then this power affects the target as well.\n\n**Special (Synergy):** You may take the synergy power modification synergizing Poison and Weaken.\n\n**Power Stunts:**\n\n*Emulated Powers:* Poison (for Physical Attributes), Emotion Control (for Mental Attributes) *Power Tricks:* Mass Weakness\n\n### \\<h3\\>Wall Crawl\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Ability:** Strength\n\n*You can climb walls as if you were walking or running.*\n\n**Effect:** You gain a Climb Pace equal to your power score modifier and can climb on any hard surface. The editor-in-chief may require you to perform power checks to resist being ripped off a surface or to stick onto a particularly slick surface.\n\nAlternately, this power can be used to resist unwanted movement (such as knockback and similar effects), allowing you to add this power score modifier to any challenge and Strength saving throws to resist these effects.\n\n**Special (Power Modification)** *Climbing:* if you state you need a realistic surface to climb on with potential hand holds and forgo the ability to restrict unwanted movement, you gain a +4 bonus to this power’s power score. *If you choose this power modification*, you may apply all skill power modifications to this power.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Wireless\n\nRange\n\n**Primary Ability:** Wisdom\n\n**Action:** Demanding\n\n**Burnout:** 3\n\n*You are a human-computer connection.*\n\n**Effect:** You can wirelessly communicate with any computer or electronics within range, regardless of whether it has an access port. You instinctively know the basic parameters of the device and can manipulate it using the greater of either your *Technology* skill or your power score modifier. You can also use this power to overcome security programs that deny access by making a Power Check against a DC set by your Editor-in-Chief.\n\n**Special (Techno-Telepathy):** While you cannot hack Androids or Artificial Intelligence with this power, you can use it to communicate with them as if you possessed Telepathy at the same power score.\n\n**Power Stunt**  \n*Emulated Power:* Mind Control (Androids and Artificial Intelligence only)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Weird Biology\n\nContinuous\n\n**Primary Attribute:** Constitution\n\n*Your biology resists most normal afflictions*\n\n**Effect:** You gain a bonus equal to your power score modifier (minimum +1) on any roll to resist disease, poison, or other physical malady, and as a bonus to your defense against any attack from diseases, poisons, or other physical malady, including powers like Poison.\n\n**Note:** This power pairs well with the Dependence Disadvantage (p. X). A hero whose weird biology makes them resistant to normal diseases and poisons may also derive no nourishment from normal foods and require a specialized diet.\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\nResisting the Z-Virus Can the Z-Virus be resisted like a normal disease? That depends on the Editor-in-Chief’s setting. In the Paradigm City setting, it can, and while those with Weird Biology or other resistant powers can be infected, it is harder to do so. However, in a setting where the Z-Virus is supernatural in nature or an omnicontagion, this power may have no effect against it (See Zombies and Non-Humans (p.49) for more\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\n# \\<h2\\>Power Modifications (Flaws and Perks)\n\nOnce you have bought all your powers, you may choose to apply Power Modifications to any or all of them. Power Modifications change the way your power works in some way and will either increase or decrease your final power score*.* For instance, the *Conditional* Flaw would grant you a +4 to your final power scores, while the Secondary Effect Perk would reduce your final power score by -2 or -4, depending on what effect you choose.\n\n-   You may not apply perks to power if these perks reduce a power’s final score below 10.\n-   If a power’s final score, after modifications, exceeds your power score cap (20 + 5 × your rank), it is capped at this maximum. Any points above the cap are considered untapped potential. As you increase in rank, you can utilize the power’s score up to the new rank cap.\n-   You may acquire Power Modifications after Hero creation, but only at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, but your rank cap still limits you.\n\n#### Build example: two heroes, same powers.\n\nBelow, we have built two Hero examples; each one has the same powers: Entangle, Energy Blast, Force Field, Move Object, and Fly.\n\nOur first Hero is *Force,* your classic Super-Hero. Being a big fan of classic telekinetic heroes, Pete starts by choosing the Linked flaw, stating that all his powers are manifestations of his Telekinesis. Then, being a young Hero (with the Young Gun flaw), he chooses to add the Fatiguing flaw to all his powers to represent how taxing his powers are upon his young body.\n\nOur next Hero, *Flak*, is being created by Nelson to be a Tech Hero. His first piece of gear is his “force jacket,” which allows him to generate and manipulate force fields. Choosing to integrate Entangle, Force Field, and Move Object into the suit, he applies the External Power Source as well as the Linked and Removable Object flaws to the jacket’s powers. His next piece of gear would be his cybernetic plasma blasters. Choosing the Energy Blast power, he then applies the External Energy Source and the Implant flaw. His last piece of gear will consist of a pair of “Rocket Boots,” which allow him to fly, applying both the External Energy Source and Removable Object flaws.\n\n\\<Sidebars\\>  \n\\<h3\\> Sidebar: Classic Combos\n\n*Some Power Modifications work especially well when paired. Here are a few “classic combos” players might enjoy, and a few cautionary tales.*\n\n**Fatiguing + Efficient Power**\n\n*Why it works:* Fatiguing increases burnout costs, while Efficient Power lowers them. Together, you get a higher Power Score with a manageable Burnout impact.\n\n*Warning:* Even with Efficient Power, you’re still paying more Burnout than normal, make sure you can afford it.\n\n**Linked + Ego**\n\n*Why it works:* Both reinforce a strong thematic core (like all powers flowing from an ancient artifact), and the Ego bonus can stack with the Linked bonus.\n\n*Warning:* Both require careful roleplaying; the Editor-in-Chief may veto abusive combinations if the Ego dominates play.\n\n**Secondary Effect + Accurate**\n\n*Why it works:* Secondary effects can fail if you don’t beat the secondary defense, boosting your hit chance with Accurate improves your odds of applying it.\n\n**Dual-Natured + Penetrating**\n\n*Why it works:* Dual-Natured splits damage, letting you “hedge” against resistances; Penetrating ensures even high-DR foes feel it.\n\n**Removable Item + Unpowered Form**\n\n*Why it works:* Ideal for tech or mystic heroes with a “transforming” theme, as all your powers are stored in a suit, amulet, or weapon that you must don.\n\n**Overrated: Limited Uses + Static**\n\n*Why it’s risky:* You get a massive bonus up front… but the power is capped forever and only usable once or twice per scene/day. Great for niche backups, not a mainstay power.\n\n\\</Sidebars\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Accurate (Perk -2)\n\n*Your control over your power is quite impressive.*\n\n**Restriction:** This perk can only be applied to a power that attacks one of the three defenses\n\n**Effect:** You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls when using this power.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Aquatic Power (Perk/Flaw -1/+2)\n\n*Your power works just fine underwater*\n\n**Restriction:** This perk can only be applied to a power with a range\n\n**Effect:** You may apply this power as a Perk, allowing it to work underwater without restriction. Alternately, you may choose to apply this power as a flaw, halving the power’s range when used outside of underwater environments.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n### Editor’s Note: Keeping it Gritty.\n\nPower Flaws offer great potential for abuse, especially if they’re stacked. That said, it’s your game, and as Editor-in-Chief, you can deny any Modifiers or combinations you feel are unbalanced.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>All-Skill (Perk +0)\n\n**Effect:** All your powers are not the result of some inborn ability, magical powers, or high-tech gadgetry but are instead pure skill and conditioning. You have pushed your body to its limits, allowing you to do what may at first seem super-human.\n\nThis power modifier may only be applied to specific powers, as shown under Table X-X: Powers. With the exceptions of the Linked and Fatiguing flaws, no other power modifications may be applied to a power with the All-Skill perk.\n\n**Special (Power Limit):** Sadly, skill will only take you so far. With the exception of Enhanced Attack, powers with the All-Skill perk are limited to a power score of 20\n\n### \\<h3\\>Conditional (Flaw +4)\n\n*Your power only works part of the time.*\n\n**Effect:** Perhaps it only works at night, while you’re bathed in sunlight or underwater. In any case, your power should be useless at least half the time.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Critical Depletion (Flaw +6)\n\n**Restriction:** Power must have a Burnout value.\n\n**Effect:** Any time you use a power with the Critical Depletion flaw, you become instantly burned out, as if you have surpassed your burnout threshold and rolled a 1 on your burnout check.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Cybernetic Implant (Flaw +2)\n\n*Your power is not the result of a genetic mutation, but rather the product of unique cybernetic implants.*\n\n**Effect:** Any time you suffer *Massive Damage* (pg. XX), the Editor-in-Chief may have this power malfunction until the end of the scene (as your implants are assumed to have basic self-repair systems). You may “reboot” your power immediately by spending a plot point.\n\n**Special (Flaw Limitation):** As cybernetic implants are part of you, you cannot combine this flaw with the Removable Item modifier.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Distant Power (Perk -1)\n\n*Your power has increased reach*\n\n**Restriction:** This Perk can only be applied to Ranged powers.\n\n**Effect:** The power’s range is doubled.\n\n### \\<H3\\>Dual-Natured Attack (Perk -2)\n\n**Y***our power strikes with two different energy types simultaneously, making it harder for opponents to resist.*\n\n**Restriction:** This perk can only be applied to a power that deals damage.\n\n**Effect:** When you apply this perk to a damaging power, choose two damage types (e.g., Fire and Kinetic, Electricity and Sonic).\n\n-   When you deal damage with this power, divide the total damage in half (round up for one half if odd).\n-   Apply one half as the first type and the other half as the second type.\n\nEach half of the damage is resolved independently:\n\n-   Apply the target’s Damage Reduction, resistances, and vulnerabilities separately to each half.\n-   If a target is immune to one type, they still take half of the damage from the other type as normal.\n-   If a target is vulnerable to one type, double that half of the damage.\n-   If a target is resistant, halve that half of the damage.\n-   \n\nExamples:\n\nA hero fires a magma blast dealing 20 damage as Fire/Kinetic against a target with DR 2, vulnerable to Fire, and resistant to Kinetic.\n\nSplit into 10 Fire / 10 Kinetic.\n\nFire half: (10 - 2) × 2 = 16\n\nKinetic half: (10 - 2) ÷ 2 = 4\n\nTotal damage: 20\n\nA weather controller strikes with a Sonic/Electricity blast, dealing 15 damage against a target immune to Sonic.\n\nSplit into 8 Sonic / 7 Electricity.\n\nSonic half: 0 (immune)\n\nElectricity half: resolve normally.\n\nTotal damage: 7\n\nThis perk does not let you bypass complete immunity to either damage type.\n\n### \\<H3\\>Efficient Power (Perk -2)\n\n**Restriction:** This Perk may only be applied to a power with a Burnout value.\n\n**Effect:** When you do so, decrease the power’s Burnout cost by 1.\n\n**Special:** This Perk cannot be applied to a Power with the Fatiguing Flaw.\n\n### \\<H3\\>Ego (Flaw Variable, max +8)\n\n**Restriction:** Power must also have the External Power Source Flaw, and all powers that share this external power source also share the same ego.\n\n**Effect:** Your external power source has a will of its own. Perhaps it holds the spirit of an ancient mage or an artificial intelligence. Perhaps it simply influences you along a certain path. But it wants something from you, and it is often difficult to resist. This flaw is made up of three parts: Alignment, Will, and Release. Add up the scores of these three characteristics to get the final score bonus applied to the power. While the item is in control, you can still communicate with the item with it mentally in order to bargain, though otherwise, your hero is not in control of their actions.\n\n-   **Alignment:** This is the desire of the item and what it wants you to do. Keep in mind that since this item can, at times, possess you, some alignments might not be suitable. Being occasionally possessed by a demonic sword that thirsts for the blood of the innocent, for instance, will likely disrupt the game and cause more issues than it’s worth.\n    -   If this is in line with what you would do anyway, such as killing zombies or protecting your Enclave, gain +0 to your power score.\n    -   If this desire complicates matters, like questing for an ancient item or adhering to a strict moral code, gain +1 to your power score.\n    -   If this desire makes things very difficult, like amassing and jealously guarding a treasure horde, gain +2 to your power score.\n-   **Will:** This determines how difficult the influence is to resist. Whenever there is an opportunity for you to fulfill the source’s alignment, and you choose not to do so, you must make a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against a Difficulty determined below. If you fail this saving throw, the source takes control of you as if you were under the effect of the Mind Control power with a power score equal to the DC of the save.\n-   DC: 10 +0 to your power score\n    -   DC: 15 +2 to your power score\n    -   DC: 20 +4 to your power score\n-   **Release:** This determines how willing the item is to release the holder from its power after the holder fails a roll against the item’s Will.\n    -   For +0 to your power score, the item will be released to the holder as soon as its immediate action is concluded.\n    -   For +1 to your power score, the item may control the holder longer, so long as it is in immediate pursuit of its Alignment.\n    -   For +2 to your power score, the item believes it can do better in control. It will not relinquish that control unless it is successfully bargained with, threatened, or otherwise forced or persuaded.\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\nPlaying Ego-Possessed Heroes  \nThe editor-in-chief should consider letting the player continue playing as their hero when an item with Ego possesses them. They simply play the hero with the item’s personality, but the player **must** pursue the item’s alignment to the exclusion of all else.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Exclusive Power (Flaw +2)\n\n**Restriction:** May only be used with Scene or Continuous powers. It may not be combined with Roulette Power. At least two powers must both possess this flaw.\n\n**Effect:** Two or more of your powers may not be used at the same time. Whenever you activate a power with this flaw, it instantly deactivates all other powers with this flaw.\n\n### \\<h3\\>External Power Source (Perk +0)\n\n*With this modification, powers are powered by an external source, such as a power pack, ammunition, or mystical power from beyond.*\n\n**Restriction:** This may only be applied to powers with a burnout value.\n\n**Effect:** This power source possesses its Burnout Threshold of 10, and bleeds off Burnout at a rate of 2 per turn.\n\nUnless you’re a Tech Hero, you may only possess a single External Power Source that multiple powers may tap into.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Fatiguing (Flaw +4)\n\n**Restriction:** This power modification cannot be combined with power modification, which reduces or removes burnout costs.\n\n**Effect:** This flaw may only be applied to a power with a Burnout cost; increase the power’s burnout cost by half Burnout cost (minimum of 1).\n\n### \\<h3\\>Instinct Control (Perk -2/-4)\n\n**Effect:** This perk can be applied to a Mental Power. This Mental Power can now affect either non-sentient animals with a brain or non-sentient computer systems advanced enough to mimic the intelligence of animals with a brain (such as most modern computers). It can affect one of these categories for -2 or both of them for -4. This power still cannot affect brainless animals like jellyfish or mechanical systems that are not controlled by a modern computer.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Joined Power (Flaw +2, +4)\n\n**Restriction:** Cannot be applied to a power with the All-Skill Flaw\n\n**Effect:** You must choose a hero with the joined power flaw. If both agree, those powers cannot be used without both of you being in close proximity to one another. For +2 power score, both you and your joined companion must be in the same Area. For +4 power score, both of you must be in the same Area while touching each other. You may not overcome this flaw as long as your companion is alive or remains a zombie. If your companion is truly dead, the editor-n-chef may allow you to buy off this flaw with experience.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Limited Uses (Flaw +2, +8)\n\n**Effect:** Your power runs off a limited power source; maybe you deliver your elemental blast power through arrows or specialized gyro-jet ammunition, or your body needs time to recharge. Regardless, this power limits the number of times you may use the power in question on a given day. You do not suffer burnout when utilizing power with this modification.\n\n-   You may use your power once per scene, +2 power score\n-   You may use your power once before requiring a Hiatus, +8 power score\n\nAlternately, you may, at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, be able to rearm/recharge between scenes with the expenditure of a Plot point.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Limitation (Flaw +2, +4, or +6)\n\n**Effect:** A power with this limitation does not work under specific conditions or against specific items, materials, or even items with particular characteristics.\n\nMaybe your Fire Powers are unable to affect water. So, your Elemental/Energy Blast (Fire) will not work against someone with Elemental/Energy Sheath (Water or Ice). Or you may not be able to use any of your fire powers while in a heavy downpour.\n\nAt the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, this Power Flaw may be worth a +2, +4, or +6 in your power score, depending on how common the vulnerability may be. For example, water may be worth +4 due to its prevalence, while a vulnerability to refined uranium would be worth +2.\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>\n\n#### Alternate uses for the Limitation Power Flaw\n\nYou may utilize the Limitation power flaw to facilitate countless possible flaws and limitations. But be forewarned, players may use this flaw to tweak out their heroes and enhance their powers for little or no cost.\n\nTo see some interesting uses of the Limitation flaw, see the *Allies and Rogues Gallery* section**.**\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Linked (Flaw +2)\n\n**Effect:** This tweak must be applied to more than one power. All powers with this flaw are linked together through a central theme. For example, Force has all his powers linked together as they are all tied to his telekinesis power. Each power in the linked power group gains a +2 bonus to its power score.\n\nWhen using any power that is part of a group of linked powers, you always utilize the lowest power score among them, regardless of whether the power you are using has a higher power score.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Magical Spell (+0 Flaw)\n\n**Restriction:** Heroes with the Mystic Power Source only.\n\n**Effects:** Powers with this Perk are not “powers” per se, but instead spells mastered by the Hero. Powers converted to spells have the following properties:\n\nThe primary attribute for power is changed to either Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom. This choice must be made when first taking the spell and cannot be changed. All other aspects of power remain unchanged.\n\nAs you continue to grow, you may increase the power score of your spells like you would any other power. Perhaps you find a more efficient way to weave the magic, or your connection to the mystical realm has grown stronger over time.\n\nAny practitioner can teach their spells to another practitioner at the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief as their Enclave Interlude. They may use the learned spell with a power score of 12 (or the spell power level, whichever is lower) for the use of a plot point until they fully acquire it via the Acquire New Power feat, at which point they gain the spell at its full power level (minimum of 12). The primary attribute of a learned spell does not change.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Patron (Flaw +0/+2/+4/+6)\n\n**Effect:** Your power is not inherent to you but has been granted by a powerful being such as an alien, a god, a devil, or even a surviving A-lister. If you should offend this patron, they will withdraw this power until you have appeased them and may further punish you.\n\n-   If your patron makes few demands of you or has demands that are in line with what you would be doing anyway (such as fighting Zombies or helping humans to survive), this Flaw is worth +0.\n-   \\+2 if your patron is mostly benevolent but expects you to maintain a code of behavior or makes occasional demands that complicate your normal activities.\n-   \\+4 if your patron has their agenda apart from yours and expects you to follow it when they demand.\n-   \\+6, your patron is actively working against you, trying to ensnare you in an evil bargain, working against your Enclave or in favor of the zombies, or is otherwise evil.\n\n    At the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, a powerful patron might grant power to those not normally able to access it. For instance, a deal with a devil might grant a Highly Trained Hero the Bestial Transformation ability. This should involve a great deal of sacrifice and become a -2 Perk (for benevolent patrons) or, at most, a +1 Flaw (for evil patrons).\n\n\\<side bar\\>  \nEvil Patrons\n\nMaking deals with evil patrons has the potential to cause a lot of problems in a campaign, but it also has the potential for some truly amazing character arcs. In most stories, making a deal with an evil patron comes in one of two varieties. In the first, the Hero does not realize the patron is evil and only gradually becomes aware that the seemingly innocuous tasks they are required to perform are leading toward some terribly evil goal. In the second, the Hero is desperately in need of power in order to overcome some great obstacle (such as a zombie horde) and knowingly makes a pact with an evil patron out of desperation or hubris. Regardless of the method, eventually, an evil patron will either fully corrupt a Hero (which should then become an NPC), or the Hero will have to turn against their patron, being stripped of their powers and possibly paying further penalties as a consequence of breaking their bargain. Deals with evil patrons, even unknowing, should always cause more problems than they solved  \n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Penetrating (Perk -2)\n\n**Effect:** Your power is particularly effective against armor, natural or otherwise. This power modification can only be applied to a power that attacks one of the three defenses. Upon a successful attack, you bypass some of your opponent’s DR equal to half your power score modifier (minimum 1)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Power Armor (Flaw +4)\n\n**Requirement:** Tech Hero Only\n\n**Effect:** Power Armor represents an armored suit that empowers and protects you.\n\nWhen creating a suit of power armor, you can apply this power modification to any number of powers, as long as one of those powers is the Armor power.\n\n-   All Power Armor possesses the following power modifications but gains no power score bonuses from their application: *Removable Item, External Power Source* (with the external power source’s Burnout Threshold being increased to 15 and with current burnout being reduced by half Hero’s passive Intelligence modifier instead of his rank bonus), and *Unpowered Form* (with the time required to put on the armor being two continuous Demanding actions instead of one. You may reduce this time to a single Demanding action by reducing the bonus points granted by this flaw by 2).\n-   You may apply additional power modifications to powers independently, but they are limited to accuracy, fatigue, limited uses, linked, penetration, secondary effect, and static.\n\n**Special (Multiple Suits):** You may possess more than one suit of armor. This flaw applies to individual power suits, with the powers of each suit tracked as individual powers.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Power Lapse (Flaw +2/+4)\n\n**Effect:** Your power shuts down until the end of your next turn if attacked in a specific manner. For common conditions, such as being attacked by steel weapons, this flaw is worth +4 to your power score. If the condition is less common, like being attacked by magic, this flaw only increases the power’s score by +2\n\n### \\<h3\\>Removable Item (Flaw +2)\n\n**Effect:** If your power is built into an item that can be disarmed or stolen. Increase the power score by +2\n\n*\\<side bar\\>*\n\n*A word on tech in a post-apocalyptic world.  \n***All technology** suffers from *Unreliable at the best of times:* At any time, once per scene, the Editor-in-Chief may decide that a piece of your tech or an external power source just fails to work. This may be applied only to a single power. You may use a Plot Point to negate this result.  \n*\\</side bar\\>*\n\n### \\<h3\\>Roulette Power (Flaw +2/+4)\n\n**Restriction:** It may not be used with continuous powers. It may not be combined with Exclusive Power. At least two of your powers must both have this flaw.\n\n**Effect:** Two or more of your powers are combined, and you never know which one will be used. When you seek to use one of your powers with this flaw, roll randomly to determine which power is actually used. If all powers linked to this flaw are used for the same purpose (for instance, all powers that deal damage), this is a +2 flaw. If the powers are more disparate (such as Chameleon, Elemental/Energy Blast, and Summon Animal), this is a +4 flaw.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Secondary Effect (Perk -2/-4)\n\n**Effect:** One of your powers possesses a useful additional effect. Choose one of the following conditions: once per scene, you may apply this additional effect to your power by spending a bonus action to “power up.”\n\nWhen you use this perk, you must not only successfully hit the target with your power’s primary attack, but you must also surpass the secondary effect’s stated defense for the secondary effect to apply. If you fail to defeat this secondary defense, you still apply your power’s primary effects.\n\n| **Secondary Effects X-X**     |             |                          |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| **Condition**                 | **Defense** | **Power Score Modifier** |\n| Blinded\\*                     | Fortitude   | -4                       |\n| Stunned (lesser)\\*            | Fortitude   | -2                       |\n| Deafened\\*                    | Fortitude   | -2                       |\n| Exhausted\\*                   | Willpower   | -2                       |\n| Frightened, (Severe)\\*        | Willpower   | -4                       |\n| Prone                         | Fortitude   | -2                       |\n| Frightened, (Mild)\\*          | Willpower   | -2                       |\n| Weakened (Mild)               | Fortitude   | -1                       |\n| Weakened                      | Fortitude   | -2                       |\n| Weakened (Severe)             | Fortitude   | -4                       |\n| Stunned (Greater)             | Fortitude   | -4                       |\n| \\*See additional notes below  |             |                          |\n\n*Blinded* and *Frightened:* Targets affected suffer these secondary effects for a number of turns equal to the power’s score modifier +1. Targets affected get either a constitution or wisdom saving throw at the end of their turn (chosen when applying this power modification) to end this effect.\n\nAll other secondary effects remain in effect until the end of the scene.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Seeking (Perk -2)\n\n**Effect:** Your control over your power is so fine you can seek out your intended target. Thus, you ignore any penalties for Cover and don’t suffer a -3 penalty when attacking a target that is currently engaged in melee with another creature; you are still required to see the target and possess a line of effect to the target. This Perk can only be applied to Ranged Powers.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Synergy (Perk -2)\n\n**Requirement:** This power modification requires that powers specifically possess the special (synergy) feature, allowing them to synergize with other listed powers.\n\n**Effect:** Choose one of the powers combined through this power modification to be the group's primary power; any time you increase that power score, the score of all other synergized powers is increased by the same amount. You cannot increase the scores of the other powers directly, only through increasing the score of the group's primary power.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Slow (Flaw +2/+4)\n\n**Effect:** You may only apply this modifier to power that requires a Bonus Action or an Action to use. If you apply this flaw to a power that requires a bonus action, that power will now require an action, and that power’s score will be increased by +2. If this flaw is applied to a power that requires an action, that power will now require a demanding action, and that power’s score will be increased by +4.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Static (Flaw +2/+4)\n\n**Effect:** Any power with this Flaw may *never* be improved under *any* circumstances... ever. The power has reached its full potential. This Flaw may only be acquired during Hero creation and may not be combined with any other Power Modification Flaw (Flaws required by your Power Source still apply). If this Flaw is applied to the Life Support power, the power is increased by an additional +2 (for a total of +4).\n\n### \\<h3\\>Spell Power Infusion (Perk -2)\n\n**Requirement:** This can only be applied to powers with the magical spell flaw.\n\n**Effect:** When casting the spell this perk is assigned to you, you may incur additional burnout, which temporarily increases the power’s score. Doing so requires the expenditure of a plot point; by increasing the power’s Burnout by 3 points, you increase the power’s score by +2 to a maximum number of additional points equal to your wisdom score. Regardless, you may never incur more Burnout than your remaining Burnout.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Spirit Seeker (Perk -2/-4)\n\n**Effect:** Your power can affect those on a different plane of existence at full strength, such as those under the effect of the Free Consciousness or Incorporeal powers. This perk is -2 for Mental powers and -4 for all other powers. This allows powers such as Entangle to be used on Incorporeal characters. You still must be able to target a creature to affect them.\n\n### \\<H3\\>Sustained Damage (Perk -4)\n\n**Effect:** Any power with this Perk affects the target over and over - without needing a new Attack Roll. On a successful hit, the target takes the initial damage as normal. At the end of their next turn, they start to suffer your power score modifier in the same damage type for a number of turns equal to half your power score modifier, after which the target gets a Constitution saving throw to end this effect. Additional hits do not add to this continuous damage; instead, reset its duration.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Techno-Limited (Flaw +2)\n\n**Restriction:** Must be used with a power that normally affects living creatures or other organic material.\n\n**Effect:** This power only affects technology. It has no effect on organic material or living (or formerly living) creatures. If this power is a mental power, it only affects artificial intelligence.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Temporary power (Flaw +2)\n\n**Effect:** You can only apply this flaw to any continuous powers that do not require a reaction to use. The power now is activated as an Action, has a Burnout cost of 5, and only remains active for a number of turns equal to your power score modifier.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Trigger (Flaw +4)\n\n**Effect:** Your power requires an emotional trigger for you to access it. You determine the emotion with your Editor-in-Chief; once set, you may only use the power whenever you feel this emotion or you successfully make a Routine (DC: 15) wisdom saving throw. If you succeed, you have access to your power for the rest of the scene. If you fail the roll, you may not access this power for the rest of the scene.\n\nPowers such as Mind Control can affect your emotional state, allowing someone to effectively shut down your power before the end of the scene by changing your emotional state.\n\n**Special (Spells):** If this flaw is applied to a power with the spell power modification, which also has the Trigger Flaw, you may utilize an Occult skill check in place of a wisdom saving throw.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Unpowered Form (Flaw +2)\n\n**Effect:** Not only are your powers not on all the time, but you don’t have access to them until you transform (either by saying magic words, changing your physical form, or only being available when another power is in use) as a Demanding action. When you transform, you may choose to activate any of your powers with the scene descriptor as part of the same action, paying its burnout cost, of course. You may choose to apply feats to this flaw as well, making them inaccessible when not in your underpowered form. If you do so, this flaw is worth +3 instead of +2.   \nYou may only remain in your power form a number of hours per day equal to your constitution score; these hours need not be consecutive.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Unreliable (Flaw +4)\n\n**Effect:** Your power doesn’t always work. Whenever you use your power, there is a 50% chance the power simply does not work. When it does so, you use your action but pay zero burnout for the failed attempt.\n","size_bytes":184134},"docs/4.1 Plot Points, Combat, Survival 6.8.md":{"content":"Plot Points\n\nEven in a world suffering from a zombie apocalypse, Heroes are destined for greater things.\n\nThese points allow you, the player, to help shape, create, and tell your Hero's story. Not only do they allow you to alter the scene, but they also provide a way for you to have those big \"dig deep\" moments found in our favorite comics.\n\nEvery Hero starts each Issue with a set number of Plot Points (commonly one, unless modified by other rules or abilities). Players can earn, spend, and transfer Plot Points during play. Plot Points are reset to one at the start of each new Issue.\n\n# \\<h1\\> How to use Plot Points\n\nYou may spend a Plot Point at any time, but only one Plot Point can be used on any single die roll. So, unless otherwise indicated, spending a Plot Point is not an action.\n\nWhen you spend a Plot Point, it is handed over to the Editor-in-Chief, who can later use it to your advantage or detriment.   \n  \nRemember, you and the Editor-in-Chief are not playing at odds; we are all here to have fun and tell a good story. Trust your Editor-in-Chief. And don't worry, there are plenty of ways to earn additional Plot Points.\n\nEditor-in-Chief, are you wondering what you can do with your plot points? See Plot Twist! on page XX in the running the game chapter.\n\nSo, what can you do with Plot Points?\n\n-   *Alter a Scene:* You can spend a Plot Point to create an advantageous complication, altering some aspect of the scene. For Example, cause the floor of a building to give out at the right moment; find a fireman's axe when you need it the most; have a wall come down on an opponent you knocked back, giving you a few moments to run for your life; have a car explode after you blast it with fire, grab a flag pole when you are knocked off a building, and so on. Such complications should never be an \"I WIN\" button and are completely at the Editor-in-Chief's discretion.\n-   *Negate a Triggered Flaw:*  You may spend a Plot Point to negate the result of a Flaw (not a weakness) when triggered by the Editor-in-Chief.\n-   *Reroll:* You may spend Plot Point rerolling any d20 check or damage roll.\n-   *Grant the Editor-in-Chief Disadvantage:* You may spend a Plot Point to grant an attacker a Disadvantage on their Attack against you.\n-   *Help an ally Escape Death:* When an ally is reduced to 0 wounds and 0 stamina, you may spend a Plot Point to help an ally escape death; they retain 1 wound but are *Unconscious.*\n-   *Wound Recovery:* You may spend a Plot Point to ignore the result of a failed Wound Recovery Roll; the Hero's condition remains unchanged until the following day.\n-   *Aid another:* You may spend one of your Plot Points to aid another, allowing them to spend that Plot Point as if it were theirs, but you can only grant one Plot Point per scene.\n-   *Endure:* You may use plot points to mitigate the effects of diseases, wounds, overcome Exhaustion, or buy extra time in resource management crises, as later at the end of this chapter (Survival)\n-   *Influence Events:* Between Issues, you may use plot points to influence events in your enclave (see chapter XX: The Living Enclave)\n-   *Break the Rules:* You may, at the Editor-in-Chief's discretion, break the rules – in effect, do the impossible. Doing so may require several Plot Points and even a skill or power check.\n\nA Final Note: Plot Points are meant to embody the rule of cool; use them creatively, create moments, and tell a good story. Don't hoard them, spend them when it counts!\n\n\\<sidebar\\>  \n**\\<h3\\> Editor's Notes: Altering Scenes**  \nThe player should describe their desired change or addition to the scene, ensuring it is reasonable and fits within the established game world. The Editor-in-Chief will evaluate the proposal, considering the impact on the story, game balance, and the enjoyment of all players. If approved, the scene is adjusted accordingly, reflecting the player's creative input.\n\nLet the players use plot points to help you tell the story, such as when a player recalls how to access a maintenance tunnel under a mall where he used to work before Z-day. Oh, and one of your players uses a plot point to remember some interesting fact about a Z-rated hero, giving him a psychological edge.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n# \\<h1\\> Earning Plot Points\n\nYou start every Issue with one Plot Point, but there are a few ways to gain more plot points through play. When you get them, don't hoard them, as your Plot Points reset to one at the beginning of every Issue.\n\n*Personality Flaws.*\n\nIf you emphasize one of your flaws **to your own detriment**, the Editor-in-Chief may reward you with a Plot Point. In this scenario, gaining an advantage from your flaw is strictly prohibited. The Editor can limit the number of Plot Points you receive if they believe you are exploiting flaws.\n\nFurthermore, once per scene, one of your flaws can be activated by either the Editor-in-Chief or other players. If you embrace the consequences and play through your flaw's activation, you earn a Plot Point. However, it's important to note that you are always within your rights to decline the activation of your flaw, facing no negative repercussions.\n\nUpon activation, you suggest how your flaw manifests in the game, which the Editor-in-Chief can accept or even enhance. The effects of a flaw might span from statistical detriments to specifically required actions. Remember, your flaw should not grant you any advantage; it's a flaw**,** after all.\n\n*Suggesting Complications*\n\nAnother way a player can gain a Plot Point is by suggesting detrimental complications to the editor-in-chief. For Example, the players can suggest that the terrified bystanders start to fire wildly into a melee with pistols, suggest that zombies show up at inopportune times, or even suggest that their Heroes' powers burn out unexpectedly.\n\nSuggesting complications should be done in the spirit of creating a good story, not to power the game or max out possible Plot Point gain. Of course, the Editor-in-Chief has the last word on the event and is free to modify it as they see fit.\n\n*Tagline*\n\nIf you deliver your tagline at just the right moment, enhancing the scene with perfect timing or in an epic way, the Editor-in-Chief may reward you with a Plot Point. It's not just about saying the line; it's about nailing the delivery when it counts.\n\n*Editor's Discretion*\n\nFinally, a player may be awarded a Plot Point at any time during an adventure at the Editor-in-Chief's discretion. These points can be awarded to reward heroic actions, excellent role-playing, or even helpful actions by the player out of character (such as driving out of his way to pick up another player to bring them to the game).\n\nIn short, Plot Point rewards should encourage players to help create a more enjoyable game for all parties involved.\n\n\\<SIDE BAR\\>\n\nEditor's Notes: Communicating Complications   \nPlayers who want to suggest a complication should pass notes to the editor-in-chief. If two or more players come up with the same complication, reward all of them with a Plot Point. Fair warning to players: Be careful what you wish for. Amid combat, complications become something new altogether. Players, use your best judgment when communicating complications. Sometimes, simply informing the Editor on your Turn may be the best approach, or if you believe a note is the most suitable method for a particular complication, consider waiting until your Turn to submit it. That way, you won't break up the game's flow and indirectly take up another player's time.\n\n\\</SIDE BAR\\>\n\nCOMBAT\n\n>   *\"Shooting Star once told me that what separated us from the supervillains was our insistence on fighting fair, even when the odds were stacked against us. Unfortunately, zombies don't fight fair either. I still miss Shooting Star.\"*\n\nThe glory days might be gone, but there's no lack of conflict in this world. The zombies keep coming, and the Super Zombies still can't get enough of that hero-on-villain Action. This section gives you all the basics for defending yourself and bringing on the pain.\n\n# \\<h1\\>How Combat Works\n\nCombat in *Rotted Capes* can be a furious clash between heroes, zombies, super zombies, armed bystanders, or even other supers trying to take what's yours. Survival in the world of rotted capes can sometimes feel like life on the edge of a razor.\n\nThe chaos of combat is organized into a cycle of turns and rounds. A typical round represents about 6 seconds of combat. During each round, each combatant gets a turn. Combat starts with everyone rolling Initiative to settle the order of everyone's Turn; once everyone has taken their Turn, combat continues until the conflict is resolved.\n\n### \\<H3\\> [Combat Step by Step](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Appendix%20B%20-%20Combat#h-Combat%20Step%20by%20Step)\n\n-   **Are you and your opponents aware of each other?** If all combatants know at least one opponent, then there is no need for Surprise.\n-   **Set the scene:** The Editor-in-Chief describes the setting and location, provides helpful information, and explains where the heroes are positioned in relation to their adversaries and any bystanders.\n-   **Roll** [**Initiative**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Designing%20Complex%20Traps#h-Initiative)**:** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls [Initiative](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Designing%20Complex%20Traps#h-Initiative), determining the order of combatants' turns.\n-   **Take turns**: Each participant in the battle takes a turn in [Initiative](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Designing%20Complex%20Traps#h-Initiative) order.\n-   **Begin the next round:** The round ends when everyone involved in the combat has had a turn. Repeat step 4 until the [punching](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Know%20Your%20Players#h-Fighting) stops.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Surprise\n\n*Apparition phases through a wall clocked in her invisibility, just above a small pack of zombies. A pack that currently stands between her and getting a family of survivors to the enclave.*\n\n*Somewhere else in the city, Silver Star* *and Red Falcon* *are quietly walking through a supermarket distribution warehouse, hoping to find some promising supplies. But little do they know they are being stalked between the crates of boxes by a surprisingly stealthy abomination.*\n\n*In these situations, one side of the battle gains Surprise over the other.*  \n  \nThe Editor-in-Chief determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the Editor-in-Chief should have them perform a *faceoff* utilizing appropriate ability scores (Commonly Dexterity for moving stealthily and Wisdom for finding them), applying any relevant skill sets or edges.   \n  \nAny combatant who doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.  \n  \nIf you're surprised, you gain the condition *Stunned (Lesser, Surprise)* until the end of your first Turn. A group member can be surprised even if the other members aren't.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Initiative\n\nAt the start of a battle, each player and the Editor-in-Chief (for the bad guys and bystanders) makes a Dexterity check, adding any Initiative bonuses to determine their place in the Initiative order.   \n  \nThe Editor-in-Chief ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. Setting up the order (called the Initiative order) in which they act during each round. The Initiative order remains the same from round to round.\n\nIn the case of a tie, the heroes go first. If two or more heroes are tied, allow them to agree on an order amongst themselves. If your threats are tied, they all act simultaneously.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Joining Combat\n\nAny creature that enters combat in progress makes a dexterity check, adding their initiative bonus, if any, to see where they fall in the current initiative order. Sometimes, a new combatant may enter the unseen combat and surprise everyone.\n\n# \\<h1\\>On Your Turn\n\nOn your Turn, you may take a number of different actions; you may move your Pace and take one **Action**, and a **Bonus Action**, and any number of **Trivial Actions** (within reason). Additionally, between your turns, you may take a special action called a **Reaction.**\n\n## \\<h2\\> Actions\n\nEach character can take a single **Action** on their Turn, which they may use before, after, or during their movement. When taking an **Action**, you can do the following.\n\n-   Attack\n-   Assist\n-   Dash\n-   Demanding\n-   Disengage\n-   Dodge\n-   Hide\n-   Ready\n\nWhen you describe an Action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, it's up to the Editor-In-Chief to judge if the Action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Bonus Actions\n\nVarious feats and powers let you take an additional action on your Turn called a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action; otherwise, you don't have a Bonus Action to take.\n\nYou can take only one bonus action on your Turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\n\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your Turn unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take an action also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Trivial Actions\n\nSpeaking, opening a door, flipping a light switch, drawing a weapon, reading a sign, picking up an item, or even pulling up your cowl are so trivial that they don't take up any of your actions on your Turn. You may perform any number of these actions on your Turn within reason. You're the editor-in-chief, the final arbiter regarding how many trivial actions in any particular situation are reasonable.\n\n**\\<side bar\\>**\n\n### \\<H3\\> Editor's Note**: Environmental Complications**\n\nRotted Capes is a horror game, after all. Sometimes, door jams that have been shut for years, or rust or neglect, make electrical sliding doors tough to open when the power is off. Additionally, that box of supplies may have its bottom rip open from the weight of the cans inside. Even though the rules commonly allow players to interact with the environment for free. It's not always the case. Sometimes, you may have to use all of your Pace, an Action, or maybe even a Demanding Action.\n\nPlayers may also offer a complication on their Turn in telling the story, in which case, remember to give them a Plot Point; they may very well need it.\n\n**\\</side bar\\>**\n\n## \\<h2\\> Reactions\n\nSpecific powers, feats, and special circumstances allow you to take a special action called a Reaction.\n\nA Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your Turn or someone else's. The opportunity attack is the most common type of Reaction. You commonly only have one Reaction, but some powers and feats may provide additional reactions. If the Reaction interrupts another creature's Turn, that creature can continue its Turn right after the Reaction.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Using Powers and Manuvers\n\nEvery power and combat maneuver in *Rotted Capes* tells you how it's used; some take an Action, some a Bonus Action, some require a Demanding Action, and others are always on or triggered by specific events.\n\n**Always check the power or maneuver's description**, it will tell you what kind of Action (if any) it takes to use.\n\nYou might:\n\n-   Spend an **Action** to blast an enemy across the battlefield,\n-   Use a **Bonus Action** dash across the battlefield.\n-   Take a **Demanding Action** to teleport across the city,\n-   Or use a **Reaction** to activate your force field im response to an attack.\n-   Spend an **Action** to Ready setting up an epic Team Attack.\n\nPowers and maneuvers are your heroic toolkit. Use them to punch harder, move faster, hit weirder, and survive longer.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Movement\n\n*Leaping between rooftops, sprinting through hordes of undead, or dive-bombing a Super-Z before it tears a bus in half, Rotted Capes is just as much superhero action as it is zombie horror. That's why we use areas for movement: a flexible, abstract system that fits the genre's high-energy chaos.*\n\nOn your Turn, you can move a number of Areas up to your Pace, capped at 5 Areas unless you have a power, feat, or feature that breaks that limit. You can move all at once, break it up before and after your Action, or just take a step, your call.\n\nYou're not locked into one kind of movement either. You can run, fly, swing, climb, or swim, all in the same Turn, if you've got the means. Just deduct the total distance you cover (in Areas) from your Pace as you go. Once you hit 0, you're done moving. Simple.\n\nWant to leap from the roof, swing across the alley, and land behind a wrecked ambulance? Go for it, if you've got the movement to pull it off.\n\nThis system is meant to empower imagination and big damn hero moments. Whether you're on a gridded map or just narrating with dice in hand, movement in *Rotted Capes* is there to support the story, not slow it down.\n\n**Example:** If you have a Fly Pace of 10 and a Run Pace of 4, you could run 4 areas and then fly 6 more, using up your total of 10. However, you could not run 5 areas, as your Run Pace cap is at 4.\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>  \n**\\<h3\\>Playing with 1\" squares**   \nThese rules for movement are intended to create a baseline on how far a hero can move; the movement system in Rotted Capes is designed in such a manner to facilitate the use of tabletop miniatures or playing purely theater of the mind. Use as many or as few of these rules as you and your group feel are necessary.\n\nIf you use a map with 1\" squares, multiply all paces by 4 to determine the number of squares a creature can move. Whenever a rule specifies an area, use 4x4 squares.\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>   \n  \n**\\<h3\\>Areas**\n\nIn *Rotted Capes*, we don't measure movement in feet; we use **Areas**, abstract zones that reflect how far a character can reasonably travel in the chaos of a comic book battle. Outdoor Areas are roughly 400 Sq. Ft. (roughly a 20' x 20' square), while inside, Areas commonly refer to rooms, with exceptionally large rooms (like a warehouse or arena) are split into individual Areas to reflect their scale.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Being Prone\n\nSometimes you get knocked on your back end, sometimes you have to dive for Cover, either way, you're Prone. Dropping prone is easy; it costs no movement, but getting back up is another matter. That takes effort. Standing costs half your total Run Pace. You can always use a power to get back up (like Flying), in which case you reduce your Pace by 1.\n\nYou can crawl while prone, but it's slow going. Crawling costs +2 Areas per space moved (minimum 1), while crawling through Difficult Terrain is even worse, 4 Areas per space.  \nSo, if your Pace is 4, you'll need to spend 2 to get on your feet. If your Pace is 0, you're stuck crawling unless a power helps you out.\n\nExample: You've got a Dexterity of 12 (Run Pace 1) and you're prone in a debris-filled hallway (Difficult Terrain). Crawling to the next Area will take you **4 turns** unless you have a better way out.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Special Movement Types\n\nSome heroes and threats move in ways that defy gravity, terrain, or physics. Whether you're soaring through the air, digging through the earth, or swinging through ruined city skylines, alternate movement types follow the same rules as normal movement, with a few extra traits.  \n\\<side bar\\>\n\n**\\<h4\\> Climbing & Swimming**\n\nNot everyone's built to scale walls or swing through a flooded subway tunnel, and that includes a lot of our less-graceful heroes.\n\nIf you don't have a Climb Pace or Swim Pace, you can still attempt to, but it's slow and taxing. Swimming and climbing without a power of some kind costs 2 areas of movement for every 1 area traveled. This means that a hero with a Pace of 4 will only manage 2 areas of progress while climbing or swimming in a turn.\n\nThe Editor may issue a challenge to keep moving, especially if the conditions are dangerous, slick surfaces, strong currents, or that pack of Deadheads splashing after you. Failure means no movement for that Action and possibly losing your grip or getting dragged under.\n\nIf the creature has gear (like climbing rigs, fins, or a makeshift raft), they might be able to move at their full Pace or bypass the need to meet a challenge.\n\nAnd remember, staying still while clinging to the side of a building or treading water in the middle of a bay doesn't mean you're safe. It just means you're a slower target.\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>\n\n### \\<H3\\> Flight Pace\n\nFlying characters use their **Fly Pace** in place of their normal Pace. Unless a power or feature says otherwise, flyers:\n\n-   May fly in any direction (up, down, diagonal).\n-   Must **spend at least 1 Pace per Turn** to stay airborne.\n-   Can mix flying with other movement types if they have both.\n\n**Hovering:**  \nIf a character can hover, they may stay in the air without moving. If not, they must move at least 1 area per Turn or fall.\n\n**Falling:**  \nIf you're flying and become **prone**, **restrained**, or your Pace is reduced to 0, you fall, unless you can hover. Falling may cause Damage and leave you vulnerable.\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Editor's Note: The dangers of flight….\n\nThough many benefits come with the ability to fly, there are also risks that many Heroes don't consider until they have suffered the consequences.\n\nWhile it is true that flight allows heroes reliable transportation and the ability to escape from the hordes of zombies personally, a flying hero has much more difficulty maintaining a low profile. Flying Heroes frequently draw groups of zombies that see them pass overhead, causing migrations of the undead into possibly populated safe havens.\n\nMany Super Zombies also have flight, and it's not uncommon for titanic battles to occur in midair, particularly when a Hero is caught unawares.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Climb Pace\n\nCharacters with a **Climb Pace** can move across vertical or inverted surfaces as easily as walking. And would not be required to meet any challenge to do so unless there is some special condition.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Swim Pace\n\nCharacters with a **Swim Pace** can move through water without having to meet challenges due to swimming in strong currents or rough conditions, while those without a Swim Pace must make checks to avoid sinking or being swept away.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Swing Pace\n\nSome powers, like *Swinging*, let you move by anchoring to structures and swinging across the battlefield.\n\nTo use this movement, you must have a sturdy anchor point within range, such as a beam, wall, tree, Vehicle, or other solid object. If no valid anchor is available, you cannot swing and must rely on other forms of movement.\n\nOnce anchored, you can:\n\n-   **Swing:** Move at a pace equal to your power score modifier, treated as flight for purposes of maneuverability. Swinging does not allow you to hover. If you use Swing as normal movement, you end your move standing on the ground. If you Dash, you can choose to remain \"mid-swing\" between turns.\n-   **Climb:** Climb up your line at a pace equal to half your power score modifier.\n-   **Hang:** Stay stationary, suspended from your anchor.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief may call for a Challenge if the anchor is unstable, moving, or actively targeted.  \n  \n**\\<h3\\>Burrow Pace**\n\nCharacters with a **Burrow Pace** can tunnel underground. Burrowing speed and the type of terrain you can pass through depend on your power score:  \n  \nPower Score:\n\n-   **1-20:** Easy to pass through loose soil and gravel.\n-   **21-25:** Can pass through tightly packed earth and stone, leaving a tunnel behind them.\n-   **30+:** Swim through the earth like a fish swims the sea, leaving no sign of passage.\n\nMost animals don't have a Burrow Pace, they dig slowly and can't use it in combat. Only creatures with specific powers or traits can burrow effectively.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Movement Restrictions\n\nEven in an abstract system like Areas, the battlefield isn't always open. Debris, hostiles, and collapsed structures, your environment still matters. Here's how common movement restrictions work in *Rotted Capes*:\n\n### \\<h3\\>Blocked Areas\n\nSometimes, an Area is so congested or threatened that you can't get through. This might be a hallway packed with Zs, a barricade of wrecked cars, or a hulking Super-Z like Titan standing in a doorway. You may not move past such Areas unless those enemies are three or more size categories larger or smaller, but you may move past allies with no issue. Many Heroes have fought their last at such chokepoints to buy time for Bystanders to escape.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Difficult Terrain\n\nA debris-filled warehouse, a living room crowded with furniture, roads littered with abandoned cars and things left behind by fleeing citizens, or an old theater with a collapsed roof. Any Area cluttered with hazards counts as **Difficult Terrain**.\n\nEvery area of movement in Difficult Terrain costs 1 extra area. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as Difficult Terrain. Moving through an area occupied by a hostile creature also counts as Difficult Terrain.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Obstacles\n\nSome things aren't so much terrain as they are barriers, low walls, fallen beams, broken fences.  \nMoving across a minor obstacle reduces your **Pace by half** (minimum of 1), while major obstacles may require a **dexterity-based challenge to bypass or a Strength-based challenge to clear the way with** a **Demanding Action**.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Inadequate Space\n\nSometimes, a Hero or a large creature may find themselves battling in tight or overcrowded spaces (such as tight hallways filled with zombies). When a creature is crowded or squeezed, it suffers Disadvantage on all actions, as all attacks against the squeezed target’s Avoidance are made with Advantage. Large creatures may not fit into certain Areas at all, rendering them unable to enter or act.\n\n**Example:** *Silver Star and Red Falcon lure a massive Abomination into a narrow stairwell. Cramped and restricted, the zombie fights at a* **Disadvantage***, while the smaller heroes move freely and gain Advantage on their attacks against its Avoidance.*\n\n# \\<h1\\> Actions\n\n## \\<h2\\>Attack\n\nThere are two types of attacks in *Rotted Capes*: **melee** and **ranged**. Whether you're punching a zombie in the face, unloading a pistol, or unleashing a kinetic blast, all attacks follow the same basic flow.  \n  \n**Basically, if** you're rolling a d20 to hit something, you're making an **Attack**, whether it's with a weapon, a power, or just your fists.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Melee Attacks\n\nMelee attacks happen up close, commonly when you and your target are in the same **Area**.\n\nWhen making a melee attack, roll a **Strength-based attack roll** against the target's **Avoidance** (or another defense, depending on the power). If the Attack hits, you deal your listed **Damage**, which may include your Strength modifier, weapon bonuses, or power effects.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Ranged Attacks\n\nCommonly used when trying to hit targets outside your area, when making a ranged attack, roll a **Dexterity-based attack roll** against the target's **Avoidance**. If it hits, apply the Attack's Damage or effect.\n\nMost ranged attacks use guns, bows, or ranged powers. If your target has Cover, the Editor-in-Chief may apply penalties to your attack roll.\n\n### \\<H3\\>Attacking with powers\n\nSome powers utilize your powers' primary ability instead of your Strength or Dexterity. In these cases, your attack roll is based on the **primary ability** of the power.\n\nFor Example, a psychic attack can use either your **Wisdom or Charisma**, while an Enhanced Melee Attack might use **Wisdom**, depending on your choices during hero creation.\n\nYour power's description will tell you: What type of roll to make, which defense to attack, and whether it deals Damage, causes a condition, or does something stranger\n\n### \\<h3\\>Rolling 1 or 20 on an attack roll.\n\nIf you roll a natural 20, your Attack is a critical hit, it automatically hits, and instead of hitting Stamina, it deals a Wound directly. Criticals feel good. Let them land hard.  \n  \nIf the d20 roll for an Attack is a 1, the Attack misses, regardless; even the most powerful heroes miss from time to time.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Assist\n\nYou can help another creature succeed at a task. When you take the Assist Action, the creature you're helping gains Advantage on their next attack roll or ability check, as long as they make the check before the start of your next turn.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Dash\n\nTaking the dash action allows you to move twice your pace during your Turn.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Demanding\n\nSome actions take longer to execute, such as charging up a power, hacking a console mid-combat, or pulling off a risky maneuver under fire; such actions are **Demanding Actions**.\n\nA **Demanding Action** isn't your standard, snap-second move. It takes your full focus, limits your movement, and delays the effect until the start of your next Turn.\n\nIf an action is labeled **Demanding**, it follows the special rules below.\n\nWhile performing a Demanding Action:\n\n-   You **may not move more than 1 area** during your Turn.\n-   You **may not take Reactions** while performing a Demanding action.\n-   You may only take a **Bonus Action** **before** you begin your Demanding Action.\n-   If anything prevents you from taking actions (e.g., conditions or effects), you **cannot** perform a Demanding Action.\n\nAdditional rules for Demanding Actions:\n\n-   **Attackers gain Advantage** when targeting you during this time.\n-   The **effect of the Action** occurs at the **start of your next Turn**.\n-   If the Action involves a **Burnout cost**, you must pay that cost when you begin the Action, not when it resolves.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Interruptible\n\nSome Demanding Actions are labeled **Interruptible**, meaning they can be disrupted if you take Damage or are successfully attacked before the Action completes. If you are hit or suffer Damage while performing an Interruptible action:\n\n-   You must make a **Constitution saving throw**.\n    -   The DC is **10**, or **half the Stamina damage taken after DR**, whichever is higher.\n    -   If you suffer a **Wound**, the DC is set to **25**.\n-   You must make a **new saving throw each time** you take Damage.\n-   If you **fail** any of these saves, the Action is **disrupted** and does not complete.\n-   If interrupted, you **do not pay any Burnout cost**.\n-   You may try the Action again on a future turn if desired.\n\n**Example:**   \nStepaside attempts to use his power, *Geospatial Shift*, to escape a dangerous situation. The power requires an **Interruptible Demanding Action**, so he moves 1 area back and begins the process.\n\nBefore his next Turn, Flaming Fist hits him with a fire bolt that deals 10 Stamina damage. Stepaside must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 10 (since half of 10 = 5). If he fails, the Action is interrupted and does not occur, but he can try again on his next Turn.\n\n**\\<h2\\> Disengage**  \nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke [opportunity attacks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_40) for the rest of the Turn.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Dodge\n\nWhen you take the dodge action, until the start of your next turn, all attacks against your Avoidance are made at a Disadvantage. You must be able to see where the Attack is coming from to benefit from this Action; you lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or your Pace drops to 0\n\n## \\<h2\\>Hide\n\nWhen you take the **Hide** Action, you attempt to vanish from sight, ducking behind Cover, slipping into shadows, or using the chaos of battle to disappear.\n\nTo do so, you must participate in a *face-off challenge* against any possible observers. This might require a *dexterity-based challenge* against the result of a *wisdom-based challenge* by any observers, applying applicable skill sets or edges. If you succeed, you're considered hidden, and you gain the benefits described under **Unseen Attackers and Targets**, including Advantage when you strike from the shadows.\n\nRemember, zombies can't eat what they can't see. Probably.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Ready\n\nSometimes, the best move is to wait for the perfect moment. When you want to act in response to something specific, you can use the **Ready** Action.\n\n**Choose a trigger,** a visible event or condition you're waiting for, and **declare your response,** either an **Action** you'll take or movement up to your normal Pace.\n\nYour Reaction will then go off **when that trigger happens**, as long as it occurs before the start of your next Turn. Just remember: if your trigger never happens, you lose the Action; waiting comes with risk.\n\nExamples:  \n*\"If those zombies walk through the archway, I'll pull the lever and drop the blast doors.\"  \n\"If that merc charges me, I'll blast him with a power shot.\"*\n\n# \\<h1\\> Rections\n\nReactions are a special kind of Action that takes place between your turns. Unlike other actions, all Reactions require a trigger, unless that trigger is satisfied, you may not use that Reaction. While some Feats, Powers, and maneuvers are performed as a reaction, the most common Reaction is the opportunity attack..\n\n## \\<h2\\>Opportunity Attacks\n\nCombat is chaotic, but smart fighters watch for openings, and savage zombies strike when someone's back is turned. These moments are called **Opportunity Attacks**.\n\nWhenever a **hostile creature you can see leaves your Area**, you can use your **Reaction** to make a **melee attack** against them. That Attack happens **just before** they exit your reach.\n\nOpportunity Attacks don't happen often, but they hit hard when they do.\n\nYou do not get an opportunity attack when:\n\n-   The creature teleports out of your Area.\n-   It uses the Disengage Action.\n-   It's pushed, pulled, thrown, or moved by something else (like an explosion, gravity, or a power).\n-   You can't see the creature.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Combat Modifiers\n\nAttack roles can be modified by circumstances in combat, such as Cover and range.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Ranged Modifiers\n\nYou suffer Disadvantage on attack rolls when attempting to hit a target with a ranged attack under the following conditions:\n\n-   The target is within your area.\n-   The target is beyond your weapon's or power's maximum range.\n-   The target is engaged in melee combat.\n\nTrying to thread a shot through a fistfight is a risky move.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Unseen Attackers and Targets\n\nCombatants often try to disappear, either by hiding in darkness, vanishing with powers like **invisibility**, or just staying out of sight.\n\nWhen you attack a target you can't see, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. This applies whether you're guessing the target's location or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. You automatically miss if the target isn't in your designated location. Typically, the editor-in-chief will state that the Attack was missed without revealing whether your guess was accurate.\n\nOn the flip side, if **they can't see you**, you attack at **Advantage**. If you're **hidden** (unseen *and* unheard), you reveal your location the moment you attack, whether you hit or not.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Cover\n\nPunching someone through an open window or shooting a person taking Cover behind an abandoned car can be challenging. Cover sometimes can be the difference between life or being blasted to pieces.\n\n**Partial Cover** means at least half the target is blocked, either by a wall, tree, car, furniture, or even another creature. Attacks against a target with partial Cover are made at **Disadvantage**.\n\n**Total Cover** means the target is completely blocked, you **can't target them directly** with attacks or powers, though **area effects** may still reach them. Think closed doors, thick walls, or being completely behind a barrier.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Line of Sight & Line of Effect\n\nTo target a creature with most attacks or effects, you must have **a line of sight;** in other words, you have to know where they are.\n\nThis doesn't have to be strictly visual. Darkness, smoke, and powers can all obscure line of sight. If you attack without seeing your target, you roll with **Disadvantage**, and you must have **some way** to know where they are. (at the Editor-in-Chief's discretion).\n\nBut seeing a target isn't always enough. Most of the time you'll need a **clear path** to reach them.\n\nA solid wall, a pane of thick glass, or force fields might **block the line of effect**, even if you can see the target through them. Most attacks and powers require **both** line of sight and line of effect to work.\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\n### Pet Animals and Summoned Creatures in Combat\n\nAnimals and summoned creatures act as a single unit with their controller when in combat; thus, they go on the same Initiative.\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n## \\<h2\\> Meeting a Challenge, using Powers, and Maneuvers in combat\n\nIn *Rotted Capes*, you don't just attack and move; you might find yourself hacking terminals mid-battle, leaping rooftops with precision, defusing bombs under pressure, and unleashing devastating powers. The following rules explain how to **meet a challenge**, **use** **powers**, and perform a **combat maneuver** in combat.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Meeting a Challenge\n\nDuring combat, either you or the Editor-in-Chief may present a Challenge. Overcoming it could require an action, determined by the Editor-in-Chief according to the nature of the Challenge and what it is attempting to achieve.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n-   Glancing around for exits or recalling the colors of a rival gang? Free action, quick insights in the moment.\n-   Methodically searching a supply closet, forcing open a barricaded door, or slipping away from guards? That would require an Action.\n-   Disarming a tripwire mid-chase, splicing into a secure network under fire, or trying to drive a semi through a collapsing parking garage? That might require a **Demanding Action.**\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief decides when a challenge calls for a roll, what kind of Action it requires (if any), and whether special conditions, like Advantage or Disadvantage, apply.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Using Powers\n\nEvery power has its own listed activation method. Some powers are used with a standard Action, while others may trigger as a Reaction, Bonus Action, or require a Demanding Action. A few powers are passive, always active as long as their conditions are met.\n\nFor Example, blasting someone with a power might require an Action, while attempting to teleport your team across the city while a horde of zombies is breaking their way through the drywall, an Interruptible Demanding Action.\n\n## \\<h3\\> Performing a Combat Maneuver\n\nManeuvers are special actions you can take in combat. Everyone knows a few basic maneuvers, with more complex maneuvers being learned through the **Learn Maneuver** feat. Much like powers, each maneuver lists what Action is required to use it.\n\nFor Example, setting up a Team Attack with an ally requires a reaction, while grappling an opponent takes an action.\n\n# \\<h1\\> Damage and Death\n\n## \\<h2\\> Stamina and Wounds\n\n**Stamina** measures your physical and mental stamina, and it’s the kind of damage you can shrug off, such as bruises, stress, and near-misses. No matter how much Stamina you've lost, you still fight at full capacity. It recovers quickly with rest and doesn't leave lasting effects.\n\n**Temporary Stamina** is a short-term buffer, an extra pool of Stamina that absorbs Damage before it affects your actual Stamina score. When you gain Temporary Stamina, it increases your current Stamina for a limited time. Any stamina damage you take is first subtracted from this buffer; only the excess, if any, is applied to your regular Stamina.\n\nTemporary Stamina fades quickly. If the power or effect that granted it ends, any unused Temporary Stamina disappears immediately. You cannot stack Temporary Stamina from multiple sources; gaining new Temporary Stamina automatically removes any remaining from the previous effect.\n\n**Wounds** are serious. Where Stamina handles the superficial Damage, **Wounds represent real injury**, like broken bones and deep cuts.\n\nWhen you take Wound damage, it hits hard, literally. Your ability to act is diminished, and recovery isn't quick. Wounds don't bounce back with a nap; they take time, rest, and sometimes the help of someone who knows what they're doing and has the gear to do it. And in this world, that's not always an option.   \n  \n**\\<h3\\>Dealing Stamina Damage**\n\nMost attacks, whether from weapons, unarmed strikes, or damaging powers, reduce a target's **Stamina**. The amount of Damage of the power or weapon used, which is commonly modified by the attacker's relevant ability score or special bonuses.\n\nTo resolve Damage, roll the appropriate dice and apply any relevant modifiers, such as an ability score or feat bonus. Then subtract the target's **Damage Resistance (DR)** from the total. Whatever remains is subtracted from the target's Stamina. **Damage Resistance (DR)** can reduce Damage to zero.\n\n### **\\<h4\\>Damage Resistance (DR)**\n\n**Damage Resistance** doesn't stop you from getting hit, but it softens the blow. Whenever you take Damage, subtract any applicable DR from the total before applying it to Stamina. DR might come from armor, force fields, powers, or other effects.\n\nIf multiple sources of DR apply, use only the **highest one**. Some effects, like precision strikes or armor-piercing attacks, can bypass DR entirely, as described in the effect.\n\nExample: If you have DR 5 against energy and DR 10 against fire, and a fire attack hits you, you reduce the Damage by 10.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Dealing Wounds & Massive Damage\n\n**Wounds** represent massive harm; there are two main ways you deal Wound damage.\n\n-   **Critical Hits:** When you score a critical hit, you also deal **1 Wound** of Damage in addition to Stamina Damage.\n-   **Massive Damage:** You deal **1 Wound** of Damage any time an attack deals more stamina damage after Damage Reduction (DR) than your target's Fortitude defense.\n\nIf you roll a critical hit and deal enough Stamina damage to bypass your target's Fortitude Defense, you deal **2 Wounds** of Damage.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Knockback\n\nWhen a creature is struck with a **kinetic attack** (including fists, baseball bats, TK bolts, etc.) and suffers *Massive Damage* or is dealt a *critical hit*, it may be knocked back if the attacker has a Strength of 20 or higher or possesses the **Enhanced Strength** origin feature.\n\nWhen that happens, the creature is either knocked to the ground or sent flying:\n\n-   If they are knocked to the ground, they are *prone*, in your area.\n-   If they are sent flying, they are moved 1 area away from the attacker for every 10 points of Damage dealt (minimum of 1 area), rounded down.\n    -   If the creature hits a solid object along its path, it suffers kinetic Damage equal to half the object's material strength, plus 1d6 kinetic Damage per full area traveled, after which your target falls prone.\n    -   If the creature has not impacted any object along its path, once your target lands, it can roll a dexterity-based Challenge against a DC equal to the Damage suffered after DR. Skill Sets may apply. On a success, the target stays on their feet; on a failure, they fall prone.\n\nDon't forget that objects have structure, too! Throwing someone into a rotted-out wall may not stop them but hurling them into a steel column definitely will. Feel free to improvise! Especially if it paints a cool story moment! A good rule of thumb is that if a creature possesses a DR equal to or greater than the material strength of an object they impact while being knocked back, they always break through the barrier.\n\n\\<Side Bar\\>\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Editor's Notes: Remember!\n\nA Hero can spend a Plot Point to cause additional complications (e.g., the tumbling crates) or to save himself from a complication resulting from a knockback (e.g., grasping a flagpole when falling from a skyscraper).\n\n\\</Side Bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Continuous Damage\n\nWhen you're taking continuous Damage, like being on fire or soaked in acid, the total ongoing Damage adds up. All continuous Damage you suffer during a scene is **cumulative**, regardless of the source. Once the **total** Damage exceeds your **Stamina Defense**, you suffer **Massive Damage**, and the count **resets to zero**. After that, the buildup starts again from scratch.\n\nNo matter the source, you usually get a **saving throw at the end of your Turn** to shake off the effect and stop the pain.\n\n## \\<h2\\>How to injure Zombies\n\nAs they aren't exactly \"alive,\" zombies follow special rules when injured. **Zombies do not have Stamina**; they do not tire, nor do they react to the most egregious injuries. There are only three ways to injure zombies: crushing their heads through *Massive Damage,* dealing a lucky Wound with a Critical Hit, and using some maneuvers, such as Devastating Attack or Headshot, which destroy lower-rank zombies outright.\n\nWhen a zombie is reduced to 0 Wounds, it's destroyed.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Massive Damage and Zombies\n\n*Massive Damage* can be quite effective against the run-of-the-mill zombie but is also a game-changer when facing more powerful abominations and Super Zombies.\n\nAny time a Zombie of Epsilon level or below suffers Massive Damage, it is instantly destroyed.\n\nDelta level and higher Zombies and Super Zombies suffer normal wound damage, but do not suffer any penalties for suffering wound damage.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Zombies and Continuous Damage\n\nIt's a popular myth that zombies are vulnerable to fire; as unfeeling corpses, it's fair to say that they are less bothered by fire than humans. That said, a zombie lacks the survival instinct to put out a fire or remove acids eating away at them.\n\nOnce a Zombie suffers enough total Damage by continuous Damage to bypass their Stamina Defense, they suffer 1 wound of Damage, enough to destroy a common Z. Super Z's, on the other hand, have the cunning to remove dangerous conditions from their bodies. Still, they may forget in the heat of battle.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Combat Modes\n\nNot every battle plays out the same way, and not every villain fights fair. *Combat Modes* are optional tools the Editor-in-Chief can use to adjust the tone, pacing, or stakes of a fight, all without needing to redesign stat blocks or call for a full rewrite of the scene. These modes allow you to scale an encounter up or down, spotlight a key villain, or turn a horde of weaklings into a real threat.\n\nThe game currently includes these Combat Modes:\n\n-   **Danger Zone: The environment itself becomes a threat to the heroes.**\n-   **Horde Rules:** when weaker threats combine into a single collective powerful threat.\n-   **Unleashed:** When the villain stops holding back and reveals just how dangerous they really are.\n\n### \\<h33\\>Horde Rules\n\n*Horde Rules* allow the Editor-in-Chief to combine five or more identical creatures in the same area into a single, more dangerous unit, simplifying combat while keeping the threat palpable. Hordes move and Attack as one, gaining strength with each member that joins, and growing weaker as the heroes cut them down.\n\nAny time 5 or more of the same creatures are in the same area, they become a Horde and use the following rules.\n\n-   Hordes act as a single creature. If a Horde is formed after combat has started, the Horde, once formed, falls into the Initiative of its lowest member.\n-   Hordes move as a single unit and must remain in the same area to function as a Horde.\n-   Hordes act and attack as if they were one creature; Hordes may may attack one or two targets, gaining +2 bonus to hit and Damage for each active member of the Horde beyond the first (a a Horde of 6 would gain +10 to hit and Damage) if the Horde is splitting its attacks on two targets this bonus is split by the number of creatures attacking each target.\n-   Hordes may make one Opportunity Attack per member of the horde, using their full attack bonus. For each Opportunity Attack after the first the hordes bonus to attack and damage drop by one member of the Horde.\n-   All attacks against a Horde target a single creature within it, dealing Damage until that creature is taken out, reducing the Horde's size. Effects that impose conditions or control apply to one creature unless they affect the entire area, while area-based attacks affect all members within the area normally.\n-   Any member of the Horde is then removed from the area, is removed from the Horde, and acts as an individual creature, keeping the same Initiative as the Horde it was once part of.\n-   A Horde that drops below 5 members is no longer considered a Horde and reverts to individual creature actions.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Unleashed: When the Gloves Come Off\n\nEven villains know when to stop holding back. Some threats save their deadliest moves for when the heroes have them cornered, or when the story demands it. This isn't cheating the rules; it's revealing the villain as a true threat.\n\nWhen the Editor-in-Chief declares a villain is *Unleashed*, the villain gains:\n\n-   One additional Turn each round at Initiative -10, which includes a chance to recharge abilities.\n-   They gain an additional reaction\n-   Once per round, the villain may roll with Advantage on any attack, defense, or saving throw.\n-   Once per round, the Editor-in-Chief may use a plot point to have the villain automatically succeed in a saving throw.\n-   Double the threats' Stamina (if not a brute) or 2 additional wounds if a zombie.\n-   Once per encounter, the Villain can have a \"second wind \"and use an action to recover 1d4 wounds.\n\n### \\<sidebar\\>  \\<h3\\> When to Unleash the Villain\n\nNot every villain needs to be *Unleashed.* Reserve it for pivotal moments: the showdown at the end of a story arc, a major super-zombie on a rampage, or when the players are breezing through a fight that should feel dire. Unleashing is your tool to bring a dramatic, comic-book escalation to the fight without rewriting stats or feeling unfair.\n\nIt signals to the players: *This villain means business now…. bring your A-game.*  \nDon't overuse it. Too many Unleashed villains can make it feel routine instead of cinematic. Pick your moments and let the heroes shine when they overcome it.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\> Danger Zone\n\n*\"Then the floor just gave way underneath us.\"*\n\nSome battles take place in environments just as deadly as the villains. Whether it's a burning building, a crumbling bridge, or a mall overrun with traps, the battlefield itself becomes a threat.\n\nWhen the Editor-in-Chief declares a *Danger Zone*, the environment is treated as a threat. Environmental effects can take one or two turns a round, acting on their own Initiative count (after all the players roll Initiative, place the environmental \"action\" in the middle of the Initiative count and/or at the end of the round.)\n\nSome examples of events during Danger Zone:\n\n-   Collapse part of the floor or ceiling, forcing Dexterity saves or suffering Damage.\n-   Unleash a wave of fire, water, or falling debris.\n-   Open a new hole in the defenses, letting more zombies pour in.\n-   Blind heroes with smoke, dust, or flashing lights.\n\nA simple guideline when creating damaging environmental events on the fly, utilize a bonus to hit and saving throw DC equal to a threat of the Hero's average rank (see Table X-X Treat Parameters and Table X-X Trait Save DCs) and Damage as a threat 2 ranks lower.\n\nThe Danger Zone should add to a scene, not overshadow the villain or heroes. Use it to keep players moving, split their focus, or reinforce the horror of the world around them. Be careful how you use them, as they can unnecessarily drag out an encounter. Heroes who think out of the box (or spend Plot Points) can mitigate or even disable environmental events.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Damage Types & Categories\n\nDifferent attacks, damaging powers, and other harmful effects deal different types of Damage. Damage Types have no rules, but other rules, such as Damage Reduction, rely on the types.\n\nFeel free to create new energy types, but be warned: If the selection is too exotic, the power becomes far more powerful.\n\n\\< sidebar\\>  \n**\\<h4\\> Psychic damage**\n\nNote that Psychic Damage is a special case; due to its nature, Psychic Damage ignores DR from any source, which does not explicitly protect against Psychic Damage. However, it also has no effect against Zombies (even Super Zombies).\n\n\\</side bar\\>  \n  \nBelow is a complete list of **Damage Types** with examples to help the editor-in-chief assign a damage type to a new Effect.\n\n**Acid:** Corrosive substance that eats away at targets, causing melting or disintegration.\n\n**Ballistic:** Damage inflicted by firearms, bullets, or other high-speed projectile-based weapons.\n\n**Cold:** Extreme cold or ice-based attacks that freeze or slow down targets.\n\n**Cosmic:** is the boundless energy of the universe itself; cosmic Damage manipulates reality, space, and time.\n\n**Electricity:** Electric shocks or discharges that deliver high-voltage Damage to targets.\n\n**Fire:** Flames and intense heat that burn and scorch targets.\n\n**Kinetic:** Physical impact (such as punching) or force-based attacks that rely on sheer momentum or concussive blows.\n\n**Piercing:** Attacks penetrating and piercing through armor or flesh, causing deep wounds.\n\n**Poison:** Toxic substances or venom that inflict harm over time or impair the target's functions.\n\n**Psychic:** Mental or telepathic attacks that manipulate thoughts, emotions, or perceptions.\n\n**Radioactive:** Ionizing radiation that can melt objects, burn flesh, cause cellular Damage, or radiation sickness.\n\n**Slashing:** Cutting or slashing attacks with bladed weapons, claws, or sharp objects.\n\n**Sonic:** Sound-based attacks that utilize powerful vibrations or shockwaves to damage targets.\n\nWith **Damage Categories**, we further generalize Damage according to its source, either Energy or Physical.\n\n**Energy** consists of cold, cosmic, electrical, fire, radioactive, and sonic Damage.\n\n**Physical** Damage consists of acid, ballistic, kinetic, piercing, and slashing.\n\nPoison & Psychic Damage are not part of either category.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Dropping to 0 Stamina\n\nOnce you reach 0 Stamina, you are *Unconscious,* and although you are helpless, you will not die without outside influence. See the conditions below for the *Unconscious's* effects.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Wounded and Dropping to 0 Wounds\n\nAs long as you have any wounds of damage, you are in the *Wounded* condition.\n\nIf you reach 0 wounds but still have Stamina remaining, you are considered *Incapacitated* and in terrible pain.\n\nIf you are reduced to 0 Wounds and Stamina, you are dead unless they or a fellow player spends a Plot Point; in this case, you regain 1 Wound but remain *Unconscious*.\n\nAlternatively, you may escape death by accepting a physical flaw and having your maximum wounds reduced by 1.\n\nFor the *Helpless, Unconscious, and Wounded* conditions, see conditions on pg XX below.  \n  \n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\> Going out in a blaze of glory\n\n*Sometimes… heroes die…. they make it count.*\n\nWhen your Hero hits 0 Wounds and 0 Stamina, you may choose to **go out in a blaze of glory.**\n\nAs your final act, you get:\n\n-   One Action, taken immediately as a Reaction\n-   Automatic Critical Hit on any attack or Advantage on a Power Check if using a power\n-   No Plot Point can save you; your Hero dies…\n\nMake it count. Go out like a legend.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Healing and Death\n\nHeroes are made of stern stuff. So, at the end of a scene, you recover all of your Stamina.\n\nIf you are *Unconscious* at the end of a scene due to stamina loss*,* assuming you aren't a zombie chow, you regain **half your total Stamina** instead.\n\nHowever, healing wounds is another matter entirely\n\nYou must take **one hiatus per Wound** you currently have before attempting to recover. So, if you've taken 2 Wounds, you'll need to take **2** **Hiatuses** before you can even try to heal one of them.\n\nAfter which, you must make a successful Routine (DC: 15) Constitution saving throw to recover 1 wound; if you fail this check by 5 or more, things get worse, maybe a lot worse, roll on the Wound Recovery table to see how your condition deteriorates. If someone is treating you with an appropriate skill set (e.g., Combat Medic, Doctor, Special Forces Operative), you gain advantage on this saving throw.\n\n| Table x-x: Wound Recovery |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Result                    | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Fail by 4 or less.        | You do not recover a Wound and suffer no additional adverse effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Fail by 5 or more.        | You do not recover a wound and permanently reduce a random attribute score by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Roll a 1                  | You suffer an additional Wound as your condition worsens. At 0 Wounds, you succumb to your injuries and die. To avoid this result, you may choose a Physical Condition (see Weaknesses, pg. xx) instead. If this option is chosen, the Hero heals a Wound and takes on the flaw.  |\n\n# \\<h1\\>Conditions\n\nSometimes the dice aren't the only thing working against you. Crtain events, powers, gear, and environmental effects will impose Conditions on your Hero, their allies, or their enemies. Conditions are shorthand for a specific mechanical effect on the game, and they're meant to be fast to apply and easy to remember.  \n  \nHere is the core list of the most common and impactful states you'll run into. Everything else, whether you're on fire, frozen in place, or invisible to thermal scanners, is handled through Tags that customize a core condition or dictate its severity.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n-   **Core Condition** = the framework of what happens to you.\n-   **Tag** = the flavor, severity, additional details.\n\nYou apply the condition first, then add any tags.  \n  \n**\\<h2\\>Using Tags**\n\nWhenever you see a condition applied in these rules, the Editor-in-Chief may add one or more tags to describe it in play. Tags may:\n\n-   Indicate the source or element (Fire, Acid, Poison, Sonic).\n-   Indicate the severity (Lesser, Greater, Partial).\n-   Indicate the targeted sense (Visual, Thermal, All Senses).\n-   Indicate special effects (DR penalty, movement restriction, added saves).\n\n**Example:**\n\nA Super-Z sprays you with acid: *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed – Acid, DR -2 to armor)*.  \nA flashbang detonates nearby: *Stunned (Lesser, Sonic)*.  \nYou cloak in adaptive camo: *Hidden (Undetectable – Visual)*.\n\n## \\<h2\\> List of Conditions\n\n### \\<h3\\>Blinded\n\nYou cannot see. You automatically fail any check that requires sight, attacks against you have Advantage, and your attacks have Disadvantage.  \n**Tags:** *Partial (+2/-2 instead of advantage/disadvantage)*, *Energy Type* (e.g., Flash – Light)\n\n### \\<h3\\>Charmed\n\nYou cannot target the charmer with attacks, powers, or harmful effects. The charmer has Advantage on all social interactions with you. Lastly, the condition ends if the charmer or their allies attack you or force you to do something against your nature.\n\n**Tags:** *Magical, Psionic, Emotional, Seduction, Mind Control.*\n\n### \\<h3\\>Exhaustion\n\nSome Special Abilities, Burnout, being Wounded, and environmental Hazards, such as starvation and the long-­term Effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a Special condition called Exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. The Penalty below applies to all challenge and attack roles, as well as the creature's Pace. If a creature's place is reduced to 0, they can still move, but their Pace, regardless of mode, is reduced to 0, and they must use the dash action to move 1 area.\n\nTags: Burnout, Environmental, Sleep Deprivation.\n\n| Exhaustion Effects |             |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| Level              | **Penalty** |\n| 1                  | -1          |\n| 2                  | -2          |\n| 3                  | -3          |\n| 4                  | -4          |\n| 5                  | -5          |\n| 6                  | Death\\*     |\n\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another Effect that causes Exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\n\nAn Effect that removes Exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion Effects Ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1. Finishing a Hiatus reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\n\n\\<side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Optional Rule: Brutal Continuity, Exhaustion\n\nWhen playing in the Brutal Continuity, the penalty also applies to the Hero's saves, defenses, and burnout threshold.   \n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Frightened\n\nYou have Disadvantage on checks and attack rolls while the source of your fear is within line of sight, and you cannot willingly move closer to it.  \n**Tags:** *Mild* (affects only certain rolls), *Severe* (full effect), *Specific Target*.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Grappled\n\nYour Pace becomes 0, and you cannot benefit from bonuses to Pace. The condition ends if the grappler is Incapacitated or you break free.\n\n**Tags:** *Source* (Tentacle, Net, Cable), *Partial* (one limb only), *Immobilized* (cannot take any movement actions).\n\n### \\<h3\\> H**idden**\n\nYou are unseen by your target(s). You have Advantage on attack rolls against them, and they have Disadvantage to detect or target you. Attacking or making noise usually ends this condition.  \n**Tags:** *Undetectable – Visual*, *Undetectable – Thermal*, *Undetectable – All Senses*.\n\n### \\<h3\\> **Ongoing Damage**\n\nYou take the listed Damage at the start (or end) of your Turn until the condition ends. The source may also impose penalties. Unless stated otherwise, a successful saving throw, Action (Stop, Extinguish, Cleanse) using an appropriate Skill Set, or power ends the effect.  \n**Tags:** *Engulfed – Fire* (Disadvantage on attacks), *Engulfed – Acid* (DR penalty), *Bleeding*, *Electrical*.\n\n### **\\<h3\\> Prone**\n\nYou are on the ground. You have Disadvantage on melee attacks, your attacks at range are unaffected, and melee attacks against you have Advantage. You can spend half your Pace to stand up.\n\n### \\<h3\\> **Restrained**\n\nYour Pace becomes 0, attacks against you have Advantage, and your attacks have Disadvantage. You also automatically fail Avoidance checks against area effects.  \nTags: *Immobilized (no actions that require movement), Partial (one limb restrained).*\n\n### \\<h3\\> Stunned\n\nYou are disoriented\n\n-   **Lesser:** You have Disadvantage on all rolls, cannot take Reactions.\n-   **Greater:** As lesser additionally drop what's in your hands and all attacks on you have Advantage.\n\nTags: *Cause (Sonic, Electrical).*\n\n### \\<h3\\> Unconscious\n\nYou are unaware of your surroundings, cannot act, and drop anything you are holding. You automatically fail Avoidance and Willpower checks, and attacks against you from within the same area are critical hits.  \nTags: *Knocked Out, Medical, Power-Induced.*\n\n### \\<h3\\> Weakened\n\nYou suffer a penalty to a specific Ability Score, Power Score, or Defense.\n\n-   **Default Effect:** You take a **–2 penalty** to all rolls, checks, and derived stats based on the targeted Ability/Power/Defense for the duration, If the Penalty reduces the targeted score's modifier below 0, you use the new negative value for all calculations.\n-   **Stacking:** Multiple instances affecting the same stat do not stack; instead, take the higher Penalty.\n\n**Tags:** *Ability Score* (Strength, Dexterity, etc.), *Power Score*, *Defense* (Avoidance, Fortitude, Willpower), *Type* (Poison, Psychic, Radiation), *Severity* (Mild = –1, Severe = –4, Crippling = score halved).\n\n### \\<h3\\>Wounded\n\nYou suffer a penalty to all challenge rolls and attack rolls equal to the amount of wound damage you currently have; these penalties do not stack with Exhaustion.\n\nYou may only remove the Wound condition by healing all wounds.\n\n# \\<h2\\> Size Categories & Cinematic Scale\n\nNot every Hero fights on the same scale. Some, like the towering \"Giant Man\" or monstrous super zombies, grow to incredible proportions. Others shrink to the size of a rat to infiltrate tight spaces. While Rotted Capes already measures strength and power in cinematic terms, size plays a unique role in how you interact with the world, allies, and enemies.\n\nWhen your Hero (or threat) changes size, it's not just about how much you can lift; it changes the story of the scene. Being huge in a cramped stairwell can make you more vulnerable, while being small lets you slip through a sewer grate but risks being trampled in a melee.\n\nBelow are the standard Size Categories. Unless otherwise noted, all heroes and bystanders are **Medium.**\n\n| Size Categories Table |                       |                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Size                  | Example               | Effects                                                                                                                         |\n| Tiny                  | Cat, drone            | +2 to Avoidance vs. larger attackers, disadvantage on grappling; can move through spaces only a few inches wide.                |\n| Small                 | Child, dog            | No additional modifiers.                                                                                                        |\n| Medium                | Human                 | Default.                                                                                                                        |\n| Large                 | Horse, car            | +1 area reach, +1 to grapples, disadvantage in tight/confined spaces.                                                           |\n| Huge                  | School bus, whale     | +2 area reach, counts as occupying 4 areas, disadvantage in cramped or crowded environments, more susceptible to group attacks. |\n| Gargantuan            | Building, tank, kaiju | +3 area reach, occupies 9+ areas, may not fit into most structures, area attacks automatically include you.                     |\n\n# \\<h1\\>Vehicles and Mounts\n\nMounts and Vehicles function as extensions of their riders; they have their statistics and suffer Damage, but never act independently. Instead, the Hero directs their actions.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Movement and Control\n\nYou utilize their Vehicle or Mount's Pace instead of your own. For full rules on Pace and acceleration, refer to the Gear section, pg. XX.\n\n**Mounts:** When riding a mount, you have two options: control it or allow it to act independently.\n\n-   **Controlled Mount:** If the mount has been trained to accept a rider, it moves on your Initiative and follows your direction. It may take Disengage, Dodge, or Attack on your Turn.\n-   **Independent Mount:** An untrained or wild mount keeps its own Initiative and acts according to its instincts, not yours. It may panic, flee, or charge without warning.\n\nIf your mount provokes an Opportunity Attack while you're riding it, attackers may choose to target either you or the mount.\n\n**Vehicles:** unlike mounts, you must take control of the Vehicle. Driving a vehicle requires your Action.\n\n**Challenges While Driving or Riding**\n\nHeroes don't normally need to roll to operate a vehicle or ride a mount under standard conditions. However, when attempting risky maneuvers, stunts, or avoiding danger, the Editor-in-Chief may call for a Challenge using a relevant Skill Set.\n\nUse your Rank Bonus + relevant Ability Modifier and apply any situational modifiers (like the Vehicle's Handling rating). The Editor sets the DC based on difficulty and context.\n\nIf you lack a relevant Skill Set, roll with **Disadvantage**.\n\nIf your Skill Set includes specialized Vehicle or mount experience (e.g., *Courier Biker*, *Mounted Ranger*, *Combat Driver*), you may roll with **Advantage** when the narrative supports it.\n\n|  Vehicle/Mount Control Challenges.  |                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Challenge DC                        | Examples                                                                                            |\n| 10                                  | Calm a startled horse.

Additionally, you may suffer penalties for attacking at range.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Attacking a Vehicle or Mount\n\nWhen attacking a Vehicle or Mount, the attacker may choose to attack the Vehicle/Mount or one of its passengers.\n\n**If attacking a vehicle:** Your Attack is rolled against the roll against the **controller's passive Challenge DC** using the appropriate Skill Set (*e.g.,* Animal Handler, Driver, Pilot). Large or huge vehicles may grant the attacker **Advantage.** If the Vehicle is unattended and stationary, no attack roll is necessary. When attacking an unattended mount, you roll against the mount's defense.\n\n**If attacking the driver or passenger:** if the Vehicle moved 5+ areas more than you in the previous round, roll with Disadvantage. Missed attacks that exceed the controller's passive Challenge DC may instead hit the Vehicle.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Losing Control\n\nIf a vehicle takes Damage equal to or greater than its Material Strength, the controller must make a DC 15 Challenge using a relevant Skill Set (*like Combat Driver or Wheelman*) to retain control.\n\nApply a penalty equal to the excess Damage over the Vehicle's Material Strength.\n\nResults are determined by the Editor, but consequences may include loss of control, skidding, or full-on crashes. Plot Points can be used to mitigate the outcome.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Crashing\n\nCreatures within a crashing vehicle suffer Stamina damage equal to the Vehicle's Material Strength plus d6 for every Area traveled in the previous Turn. Creatures outside of a crashing vehicle suffer d8 for every Area traveled in the previous Turn.\n\nAppropriate safety equipment (such as seat belts, airbags, and so on) may reduce this Damage.\n\nThe Vehicle itself may survive the crash or be unsalvageable at the Editor-in-chief's discretion; of course, there are always Plot Points.\n\n### \\<h3\\>The Wireless Power and Modern Vehicles\n\nMost modern vehicles possess computer-controlled components. As such, a Hero or villain with the Wireless power may attempt to shut down the Vehicle. Due to a lack of effective electronic countermeasures against such an attack, such a task requires an action and a DC: 20 Power check.\n\nMilitary or custom vehicles may increase the difficulty to as high as DC: 30 and require a Demanding Action.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Attacking and Destroying Objects\n\nSometimes, you may need to break down a door, snap apart chains, or shatter an enemy's plasma gun.\n\nThe durability of items is reflected by two values: Material Strength (MS) and Hits. Material Strength represents the object's resistance against Damage and works like Damage Resistance. Hits represent the amount of punishment the item can absorb. Each time the Damage of an attack surpasses the item's MS, the item suffers 1 Hit (regardless of the amount of Damage dealt). *Critical strikes* inflict 2 Hits only if the damage roll surpasses the item's MS. Any attack that deals Damage equal to doubles an item's MS + Hits destroys it outright. Once the item reaches 0 Hits, it's broken.\n\nItems that are damaged but not broken retain their MS and remaining Hits until repaired as appropriate for the item in question.\n\n**Stationary Targets**: You do not need to roll to attack a stationary object. Roll the Damage and compare it to the MS of the object.\n\n**Attacking Held or Worn Items:** Occasionally, you may want to break an object held by another, such as an enemy's weapon or gadget. In such cases, you may attack with Disadvantage against the target's Avoidance. If you succeed, you damage the item, applying MS and Hits as appropriate.\n\n**Determining Material Strength:** Refer to the Material Strength/Hits Table and Construction Qualities Table on page XX to determine an object's MS and Hits. Most objects are of Common quality. Hastily-built structures are generally of Poor construction, while objects built to withstand heavy use are generally Fine.\n\n**Damage vulnerabilities/resistances of some materials:** Some materials would be more vulnerable or more resistant to Damage from particular damage sources; for Example, sonic attacks are very effective against items made of glass or crystal, and fire attacks against ice and wood, but that same fire attack would be less effective against a 1-hour fire rated wooded door. In these cases, at the Editor-in-chief's discretion, they may allow an attack to deal double or half Damage to an item, or they may raise/lower the MS of the item in question depending on how vulnerable or resilient the item is in question.\n\n| Table XX Material Strength/Hits |                               |              |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Material                        | **MS**                        | **Hits**     |\n| Paper or Cloth                  | 0                             | 1            |\n| Plastic                         | 1                             | 1            |\n| Glass                           | 1                             | 1            |\n| Ceramic                         | 1                             | 2            |\n| Hard Plastic                    | 4                             | 1 per inch   |\n| Leather or Hide                 | 5                             | 1            |\n| Wood/Ice                        | 10                            | 1 per inch   |\n| Aluminum                        | 12                            | 1 per inch   |\n| Stone/Concrete                  | 15                            | 1.5 per inch |\n| Iron                            | 18                            | 3 per inch   |\n| Steel                           | 20                            | 3 per inch   |\n| Carbon Steel Alloy              | 25                            | 3 per inch   |\n| Titanium                        | 30                            | 3 per inch   |\n| Tungsteel                       | 35                            | 4 per inch   |\n| DH3, Palladium Metallic Glass   | 40                            | 4 per inch   |\n|                                 |                               |              |\n| Table XX Construction Quality   |                               |              |\n| Quality                         | **Modifier**                  |              |\n| Poor                            | -5 MS/-1 Hits (Min.

In that case, roll a Strength check against a DC equal to the object's hits x5 + the item's Material Strength.\n\nFor Example, the Titan must roll a successful DC: 25 (15 + 2x5) Strength Check to snap a pair of handcuffs.\n\n**Trying Again:** Subsequent attempts on the same day suffer a cumulative -1 penalty.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Lifting, Moving, and Throwing Objects\n\nRefer to the Master Table (pg. XX and Appendix II); you may be able to push your limits after meeting a *Challenge* issued by the Editor-in-Chief or through the use of the Plot Point.\n\n# \\<h1\\> Survival\n\n*So, you think life's all about putting on a costume and protecting bystanders from zombies? Think again. We have much more to do than inflict Damage on the undead. Maybe you haven't noticed, but the big box stores and supermarkets aren't open. We've got to scrounge for what we need to survive, and we can only carry back so much.*\n\n*God help us if the zombies ever find our enclave. Have you ever tried to move a bunch of bystanders from one enclave to the next? People don't march in groups nearly as fast as we can alone, and during all that time they're exposed to the zombies. We've got to do what we can to keep them moving.*\n\n## \\<h2\\> Hunting and Gathering\n\nSurvival often comes down to who knows how to live off land, or what's left of it. Whether you're stalking game through burned-out suburbs or picking through the ruins of a strip mall, **hunting and gathering** isn't just about food, it's about keeping your people alive.\n\n**Locating Resources:**\n\nWhen heroes attempt to find food, water, salvageable gear, or critical supplies, the Editor-in-Chief may call for a Challenge using a relevant Skill Set such as: *Wilderness Survivalist, Urban Scavenger*, *Former Park Ranger, or Wasteland Courier*.\n\nIf the Skill Set applies to the environment and the task, the Hero rolls a Challenge using their Rank Bonus + Ability Modifier, with the Editor setting the DC based on conditions like scarcity, weather, danger, or local decay.\n\nHeroes lacking an appropriate Skill Set must roll with disadvantage unless they can creatively justify experience that would apply.\n\n**Tracking Prey:** If the Hero's Skill Set includes experience with wilderness navigation, hunting, or tracking (e.g., *Scout Sniper*, *Big Game Hunter*, *Z-Wrangler*), they may attempt to pursue animals or roaming threats.\n\nThey must describe how their Skill Set helps them follow signs such as tracks, scat, blood trails, or movement patterns, and then roll a Challenge against a DC determined by terrain, creature type, and time since the trail was fresh.\n\n**Gathering in Urban Environments:**\n\nIn ruined cities, survival depends on your knowledge of collapsed infrastructure and human behavior. Skill Sets like *Urban Forager*, *Custodian*, *Maintenance Tech*, or *Former EMT* might help you identify where resources are hidden or where danger still lingers.\n\nChallenges could include:\n\n-   Safely looting unstable buildings\n-   Navigating collapsed tunnels or alley mazes\n-   Spotting usable materials among ruined storefronts\n-   Locating medicine, batteries, or clean water\n\n**Success and Consequences:**\n\nSuccess means finding food, clean water, medicine, or even long-lost pre-Z'Day gear. Failure might mean wasting time and risking exposure… or stumbling into something worse.\n\n**Critical Success or Failure**: These may trigger story elements. Success might uncover a hidden safehouse or working Vehicle. A failure might alert a raider patrol, or disturb a resting Super Z.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Thrust and Hunger\n\nHeroes who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of Exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the required amount.\n\n**Starvation:** You need one pound of food daily and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound daily counts as half a day without food.\n\nYou can go without food for several days equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, you automatically suffer one level of Exhaustion.\n\nA normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\n\n**Dehydration:** You need one gallon of water daily or two gallons per day if the weather is too hot. If you drink only half that much water, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of Exhaustion at the end of the day. If you have access to even less water, you automatically suffer one level of Exhaustion at the end of the day.\n\nIf you already have one or more levels of Exhaustion, you take two levels in either case.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Disease\n\nAn aspect rarely touched upon in the classic superhero genre is that of disease, but not so in *Rotted Capes*. Although the threat of being infected by the Z-Virus is a constant, it's not the only disease the Heroes have to worry about.\n\nAt the onset of the disease, roll an attack against the target's *Fortitude* utilizing the disease's attack bonus*.* If it successfully hits, the target is infected and suffers the disease's initial infection effect. After the allotted time, the Hero must perform a constitution saving throw that disease's Resistance (DC); a failed roll sends the target to the next stage of infection, and so on. A successful saving throw moves the target up the track; if the target succeeds in his saving throw against the initial infection, he shakes off the disease.\n\nInfection tracks can be 2 to 4 levels in length. The Hero only suffers Damage from any particular stage of infection once and may not heal Damage dealt by a disease until cured. Lastly, some diseases may require a specific cure; in this case, a target cannot shrug off the disease and remains in the initial infection state until the cure is administered.\n\nPlayers may use Plot Points to gain Advantage on their saving throw to resist the disease, but may not use them to automatically succeed.\n\n**Word on Antibiotics:** While most antibiotics have lost much of their potency in the years following Z-Day, they are still very useful. If a Hero has access to antibiotics when attempting to fight off a disease, they gain a +5 bonus to Constitution saving throws.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Encumbrance\n\n*Rotted Capes* assumes that Heroes are used to carrying burdens and rarely drag them into combat situations. So long as the Editor-in-Chief determines that the objects carried are reasonable, there's no need to worry about encumbrance.\n\nA Hero walking into a supermarket with a backpack, two pistols, a shotgun, a machete, and night vision goggles is fine, but if she expects to leave with a hundred or so canned goods, then she better push a cart or load them up in an automobile.\n\nShould the Editor-in-Chief feel that a Hero is stretching credibility, she may apply a penalty. Each gives out levels of encumbrance, with each level lowering the Hero's Pace by 1 and subtracting 1 from the Hero's Avoidance Defense and all Strength and Dexterity rolls when attempting to meet a challenge.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Falling\n\nA fall from any height can be dangerous.\n\nFor every area you fall, you suffer d8 Stamina, which may result in *massive Damage*. You land prone unless you somehow avoid taking Damage from the fall. In addition to this stamina damage, you may suffer additional wound damage if you fall far enough.\n\nIf you fall more than 3 full areas, you must make a Challenging (DC: 20) Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 wound.\n\nIf you fall a distance greater than 4 full areas, you suffer 2 wounds and must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 20 +5 for each area fallen beyond the 4th or suffer an additional 2 wounds of Damage.\n\nWhen falling into the water, ignore the first Area if you may roll to meet a DC: 15 Dexterity based challenge, Appling any relevant skill sets to dive into the water, reducing the effective distance fallen by three areas.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Light and Darkness\n\nThere are three levels of illumination: Bright*,* Shadowy*,* and Dark.\n\n-   **Bright:** Full visibility. You can see details, read expressions, and fight without Penalty.\n-   **Shadowy:** Low light. Shapes and movement are visible, but details are hard to make out.\n-   **Dark:** No ambient light. Vision is negated unless you have a power, feature, or device that allows you to see in Darkness (such as thermal vision or night vision).\n\nRefer to Table X-XX: Light Source Ranges for the effect radius of various lighting tools.\n\n-   Lanterns, torches, and similar items provide Bright light in their area and Shadowy light in adjacent ones.\n-   Flashlights, headlights, and spotlights are directional and only illuminate what they're aimed at.\n\nCombat penalties and Challenge modifiers apply based on the level of illumination:\n\n-   In Shadowy Light: You suffer -2 to attacks and to any Challenge or Attack roll where clear vision is critical.\n-   In Darkness: Vision-based actions automatically fail unless the creature is making some sound that can be tracked, in which case you suffer Disadvantage to attacks and to any Challenge where clear vision is critical.\n\nZombies are not affected by normal lighting conditions. Their heightened senses and thermal perception allow them to track and hunt the living even in complete Darkness.\n\n**Movement in Darkness**  \nIf a hero exceeds the Pace Limitation (typically more than 3 areas per Turn) while in Darkness, they must describe how one of their Skill Sets allows them to move safely under those conditions, such as *Urban Runner, Blind Warrior Monk, or Survivalist Tracker.*\n\n-   If applicable, the Editor may call for a **DC 15 Challenge** using the appropriate Ability and Skill Set.\n-   On failure, the Hero stumbles or collides with unseen hazards and falls **prone.**\n\n| **Table X-XX: Light Source Ranges** |             |              |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| **-- Range in Areas –**             |             |              |\n| **Light Source**                    | **Bright**  | **Shadowy**  |\n| Candle                              | 0           | 1 Adj.       |\n| Torch                               | 1           | 2 Adj.       |\n| Light Bulb (60w)                    | 1           | 2 Adj.       |\n| Flashlight\\*                        | 2           | 2            |\n| Tactical Flashlight\\*               | 2           | 1            |\n| Car Headlight\\*                     |             |              |\n| - Low Beam                          | 15          | 2            |\n| - High Beam                         | 20          | 4            |\n| Lamp/Lantern                        | 1           | 2 Adj.       |\n| Campfire, Small                     | 1           | 2 Adj.       |\n| Campfire, Large                     | 1           | 6 Adj.       |\n| Searchlight\\*                       |             |              |\n| - Handheld                          | 20          | 1            |\n| - Mounted                           | 25          | 1            |\n| Fireplace                           | 1           | 1 rad.       |\n\n## \\<h2\\> Rest\n\nAll living things need rest. Any character that does not get at least a Hiatus in 24 hours must attempt a DC:15 Constriction Saving Throw or gain 1 level of Exhaustion. After that, the Hero must perform an additional Constriction Saving Throw every six hours, with an ever-increasing difficulty of +5 per six hours, or involuntarily fall asleep. Recovering from this Exhausted condition requires a Hiatus. Characters may instead attempt to sleep for only 4 hours per night, postponing their Constitution saving throw to 36 hours.\n\nIf you are using the optional psychosis rules (pg xx), characters may also gain temporary levels of psychosis at the Editor's discretion; these levels of psychosis gained through lack of sleep are removed once the creature completes a Hiatus.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Suffocation and Drowning\n\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\n\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next Turn, it drops to 0 Stamina and Wounds and is dying, and it can't regain either or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\n\nFor Example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 stamina and 0 wounds.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Overland Travel\n\nWhile most game movement is handled during combat, there are times when players might need to know how far they have traveled during the day. Overland Travel is commonly used for long distances, such as traveling between cities or seeking out a new enclave.\n\n**Travel and Time:** Whereas travelers on foot or horseback travel an average of 8 hours/day, vehicles can travel 24 hours, provided there are enough drivers/pilots to rotate shifts.\n\n**Walking and Marching:** characters may walk for a total of 8 hours/day; Marching may extend the time walked for an additional number of hours up to the Hero's constitution passive modifier, but afterward, the Hero suffers a level of Exhaustion for a number of hours equal to half the additional hours matched. Heroes may continue to walk/march past their maximum time but start to suffer additional levels of Exhaustion for every 2 hours of travel. Levels of Exhaustion may not be recovered until the Hero rests for 8 hours.\n\n**Mounted Movement:** A mount follows the same rules above, except when pushed beyond their maximum travel time per day, they may, at the editor-in-chief's discursion, become lame or suffer a crippling injury, the mount suffers a wound, and unless the Hero expends a plot point, the mount is permanently reduced to half- movement. Regardless, the mount cannot travel any further for 8 hours.\n\n**Vehicular Movement:** Referring to the master values table, simply cross-reference the Vehicle's Pace to determine its top mph (miles per hour). This indicates the fastest speed that it can go under the best possible conditions. Many vehicles aren't designed for off-road travel; even paved roads have obstacles and deteriorating conditions. It's safe to assume that most vehicles travel between 25 – 40 mph.\n\n\\<SIDE BAR\\>\n\n**\\<h4\\>Travel time and the story**   \nAs the Editor-in-Chief, you may dictate how long it takes to get from point \"A \"to point \"B\"; the rules for overland travel are simply guidelines. Of course, sometimes the true story is found in the journey, not the destination.\n\n\\<SIDE BAR\\>\n\n**Travel Conditions:** Different effects may hamper the Heroes' progress, i.e., storms, thick forests, or every sailor's nightmare, a dead calm. The Editor-in-Chief chooses a rank that best matches the conditions met during the trip and applies those modifiers to the overland speed. Only under perfect conditions will a Hero, mount, or Vehicle move at its quickest.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief may also feel free to apply trivial conditions differently, depending upon the method of travel. While hilly terrain might be challenging for heroes on foot, it could very well be Dangerous for a sedan, and it could be perfect conditions for a hero riding a dirt bike.\n\n| **Table: X-XX: Travel Conditions**  |               |                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Condition**                       | **Modifier**  | **Example**                                                                                  |\n| Perfect                             | 100%          | Optimal Conditions, well-paved roads, clear sky.                                             |\n| Moderate                            | 75%           | Cracked roads, dirt trails, rain.                                                            |\n| Challenging                         | 50%           | Very broken road, overgrown trail, hills, steady rain.                                       |\n| Difficult                           | 25%           | Obstacles all over the road, mountains, and heavy rain.                                      |\n| Daunting                            | 10%           | Extreme Weather (Hurricane, Blizzard), Extreme Conditions (crumbling bridge, urban rubble).  |\n","size_bytes":95826},"docs/4.2 The living Enclave 3.0.md":{"content":"# \\<H1\\> The Living Enclave\n\nRotted capes is more than about punching zombies, it’s a story about survival, and the lives of those whom the heroes are fighting to protect.

Your actions in-game and in between during *Enclave Interludes* alter these scores, shaping the enclave’s culture and your hotel’s accommodations.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Enclaves characteristics\n\n**Cohesion** (moral, unity): Cohesion reflects the collective unity, trust, and emotional resilience of the enclave’s members. It measures how well the survivors work together under pressure, resolve disputes, and maintain hope in the face of the apocalypse. High Cohesion allows the community to act as one, supporting heroes in crises and reducing infighting. As survivors lose faith or factions emerge, Cohesion falters, making cooperation harder and risking fragmentation.\n\n**Resources** (food, supplies, energy): Resources represent the enclave’s material abundance and stability, including food, water, power, and critical supplies. A strong Resources rating means the enclave can endure shortages, keep its Facilities operational, and provide heroes with what they need to succeed. As Resources dwindle, the community is forced to ration, Facilities shut down, and desperation sets in, making survival and recovery increasingly difficult.\n\n**Security**: Security measures the enclave’s ability to defend itself against external threats. It encompasses fortifications, surveillance, concealment, and the vigilance of its guards. Strong Security keeps zombies, raiders, and rival factions at bay, buying the heroes time to act. As Security erodes, breaches become more frequent, attacks more dangerous, and fear more pervasive, threatening the enclave’s very existence.\n\n**\\<h3\\> Facilities**   \nIn addition to the three characteristics above, your enclave can have any number of *facilities.*\n\nFacilities give you something exceedingly rare in the post-apocalyptic world of rotted capes, a safe place to apply your skills with all the tools and resources you have in one organized place. Facilities enable you to utilize *Enclave Interludes*, the downtime between issues, to apply your skill sets in ways not possible in the outside world.   \n  \nFacilities are what make Enclave Interludes possible. Between Issues, during downtime, heroes can engage in Enclave Interludes to apply their Skill Sets in ways that aren’t possible while scavenging through ruined streets or fighting for their lives.\n\nDifferent facilities provide tangible benefits tied to specific Skill Sets or narrative features. For example, a short-wave radio room grants your enclave the ability to reach out and communicate with other enclaves, expanding your options for trade, diplomacy, and alliances. A Tactical Room, lined with city maps and marked with the intel you’ve gathered from countless missions, lets your team plan their next foray into the city with precision.\n\nSome enclaves will already have a number of facilities in place when play begins, while others might be little more than a fortified shell, leaving it to the heroes to build, expand, and upgrade as the campaign unfolds. Facilities have ranks of their own, just like enclaves, representing their condition, level of sophistication, and capacity. Unlike the overall ranks of the enclave itself, whose true scores are kept hidden by the Editor-in-Chief, a hero can usually determine the rank of a facility after spending some time working on or inspecting it with an appropriate Skill Set.\n\n## \\<H2\\> Enclave Events\n\nAt the start of every issue, the Editor-in-Chief checks to see if an unusual incident occurred in the enclave. The significance of these occurrences varies, ranging from minor instances that are lightly addressed to major subplots that develop into independent storylines. Enclave events may present new challenges, opportunities, or dilemmas that affect the community.\n\n## \\<H2\\> An Enclave in Crisis\n\nCertain situations might push an enclave into a crisis. These crises can arise from fluctuations in characteristic scores during gameplay. For example, if you rescue a group of survivors and boost the enclave’s population beyond the hotel’s ability to feed them, or if an attempt to increase the hotel’s energy score fails dramatically, a crisis unfolds. During these crises, random event table rolls are bypassed, and the crisis itself might even become the central focus of the upcoming session.\n\nWhen these events take place, you are given a limited timeframe to resolve the crisis. Failure to do so has consequences. For instance, if you cannot address the crisis in a timely manner, the enclave's morale and unity may deteriorate. People could go hungry due to the hotel’s inability to support new arrivals, or they might endure hardships stemming from a damaged energy source.  \n  \nCrises are resolved through narrative play and creative challenges, tailored to what the enclave is facing. Repairing a power grid, calming a panicked crowd, fortifying defenses, negotiating peace, these are moments for heroes to step up and make hard choices. When a hero’s backstory or unique experience comes into play, it can become a defining moment of their story.\n\n## \\<H2\\> Enclave Interludes\n\nBetween Issues, heroes may engage in Enclave Interludes, narrative downtime where you step away from the front lines to focus on your personal goals, your community, and the long-term survival of your enclave. These quiet, deliberate moments are just as much a part of being a hero as punching zombies or fending off raiders.\n\nDuring an Interlude, you can put your training and ingenuity to work in ways the chaos of the outside world doesn’t allow. You might train bystanders to help shoulder the burden of defense, shore up failing infrastructure, negotiate with neighboring factions, or pursue personal projects like occult research, crafting new technologies, or piecing together lost parts of your own identity.\n\nThe needs of the enclave should help guide your priorities. If danger looms, you might focus on Security: bolstering the walls, organizing militias, or reinforcing choke points. If times are calm, you might work to expand the enclave’s Resources by cultivating trade, scrounging supplies, or improving morale through events and outreach. Every choice you make here has consequences, weaving into the ongoing story and shaping the community you protect.\n\nBelow is a list of common Interlude activities, but it’s far from exhaustive. As with everything in Rotted Capes, creativity and collaboration between player and Editor-in-Chief are encouraged. Every Interlude can yield one of two kinds of benefits to the enclave. Temporary benefits are quick fixes or stopgaps, often accomplished in a single session, that improve an enclave characteristic for just the next Issue. Permanent benefits are longer-term, requiring commitment across multiple Interludes to raise a characteristic or facility rank permanently. How long it takes, and what it requires, is intentionally flexible.\n\n*  \n***\\<h3\\>Sample Enclave Interlude Activities**\n\n**Training:** You spend your time training bystanders, which can result in increased resources, security, or cohesion.\n\n**Hunt & Scavenge:** You venture out into the wasteland to search for valuable supplies, equipment, or materials to benefit the enclave. Requires Skill Sets such as *Outdoorsman*, *Urban Forager*, *Survivalist,* or similar.\n\n**Enclave Maintenance**: You dedicate time and effort to repairing and maintaining the enclave's infrastructure and defenses, ensuring its stability and security. Can involve Skill Sets like *Engineer*, *Technophile*, and *Academic*.\n\n**Community Building:** You engage in activities that foster camaraderie and morale among the enclave's residents, such as organizing events, providing entertainment, or offering counseling services. Utilize skill sets such as *Performer, Counselor,* and *Team Leader.*\n\n**Trade and Diplomacy:** You work to establish connections with other enclaves or factions, negotiating trade agreements and alliances or resolving conflicts diplomatically. Relevant Skill Sets include *Law Enforcement Crisis Negotiator*, *Trader*, and *Former UN Ambassador*.\n\n**Exploration and Reconnaissance:** You can explore uncharted areas, map out the surroundings, and gather information about potential threats or valuable resources. Skill Sets such as *Military Ranger* and *Survivalist* are useful.\n\n**Research and Development:** heroes with scientific or technical skills can work on developing new technologies, medicines, or enhancements that benefit the enclave. See *Building the Impossible* below.\n\n**Intel Gathering:** You can gather intelligence on rival factions, potential threats, or hidden dangers, providing valuable data for future missions or decision-making. Any number of skill sets can be used here; this is a great way for the editor-in-chief to sprinkle in future plots. Successful challenges result in you stating the next issue with an extra plot point.\n\n**Special Missions:** You can undertake specific missions or quests that directly impact the enclave's well-being, such as rescuing captured residents, securing vital resources, or eliminating dangerous threats. This activity is more like preparing for a side mission, rather than the mission itself; perhaps you scout an area to gather information or work to convince members of the enclave to allow the mission in the first place.\n\n**Recovering/Reconstructing lost equipment:** There are times when you may lose access to one of your powers with the *Removable Item* power modification. In these cases, with the editor’s permission, you may use multiple Enclave Interludes to reconstruct your lost item. Techno-heroes can recover a single item with just the use of one Enclave Interlude or two items if they have access to a working facility.\n\n**Establish a Facility:** Work with the Editor-in-Chief to propose a “shopping list” of resources and steps needed to build or improve a facility. Expect some curveballs, no plan survives first contact with reality, but you’ll get there.\n\n**Restocking a medical kit:** Replenish medical supplies to keep your enclave ready for the inevitable injuries. The more advanced the kit, the more challenging it is to restock fully, but it could make all the difference in a future crisis.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Building the Impossible (Or at Least Improbable)\n\nWhen you’ve got an enclave full of heroes, bystanders, a handful of people who actually know which end of a wrench to hold, and just enough free time between zombie attacks, someone is bound to say: *“Hey… you know what we really need around here? A teleport pad.”*\n\nAnd honestly? Why not.\n\nSo, how does it work?\n\nIt all starts with an idea, something you want to build. Don’t worry about making it realistic, that’s the Editor-in-Chief’s job. You say what you want if it’s something simple, a new water pump, a stockpile of bandages, maybe a couple of reinforced doors, that can usually be wrapped up in a single interlude without much fuss. But if what you’re asking for is a little more… ambitious? Like a functioning teleporter or a swarm of drones that watch over the city, well, now we are talking.\n\nWhen you pitch an idea like that, you’ll need to put together what we call a *Shopping List*. This is just you and the rest of the table throwing out ideas for what it would take. What parts, what people, what weird alien crystals, what impossible power cores you’re going to scrounge up? Go big. Go weird. Have fun with it!\n\nOnce you’ve got your list, the Editor-in-Chief will turn it into a *Blueprint*. The Blueprint is the real plan, filled out with the things you didn’t think of, balanced against what resources you actually have, and maybe some complications to keep you on your toes.\n\nFrom there? It’s up to you. It will take several in-game tasks as well as a string of skill set challenges. Maybe you’re a Garage Engineer with an Edge for repurposing alien tech. Maybe you’re a Scavenger who knows every abandoned factory in a five-mile radius. Maybe you’re just someone who doesn’t know how to quit. Whatever it is, you sell it to the Editor-in-Chief and roll your Skill Set Challenge.\n\nDon’t be afraid to lean on your Edges. And if your idea ties into something deeply personal, your backstory, your defining traits, something only you could’ve thought to bring to the table, then you might trigger a Deep Cut Moment and earn yourself a little bonus for making the scene that much better.\n\nNow, common stuff can be built in one interlude, no problem. But the bigger the idea, the more time it’ll take, sometimes an entire issue or longer. Also, the bigger the idea, the more likely it’ll come with a few downsides. A teleporter it’s just not portable and requires 48 hours to recharge. Those drones? Ya, they require a dozen recharge pads around the city that need regular maintenance. The point is: these aren’t just toys to strap to your belt and carry into the next scene. These are stories that shape the enclave and the world around you, and they leave a mark.\n","size_bytes":13462},"docs/5.1_Running the Game 4.5.md":{"content":"# \\< h1\\> Running a Rotted Capes Game\n\n## \\<h2\\>Awarding Levels\n\n**Rotted Capes opens the door to many styles of play.** You might lean into a campy, power-fantasy romp where the heroes kick Z's ass and save the day. Or you can crank up the horror and have the heroes struggle against overwhelming odds, fighting to survive one Issue at a time. You can even frame it as a gritty survival game, where every resource and every choice matters. Heck, you can change things up mid-issue, that's all part of the fun.\n\nRotted Capes is designed to be a low-powered game, with heroes relying on their wits as much as, if not more so, than their powers. *The default method has the Heroes advancing in level at the end of every Issue*. While this may sound fast, the power level increases are minimal; as such power level increases very slowly.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Optional Alternative Advancement Options:\n\n**Story Arc:** Instead of tying advancement to the number of issues completed. You can instead grant a level roughly in the middle of a story arch and one more level at the completion of the volume.\n\n**Number of Issues:** As your players play, several issues will be needed to gain a level. Players all gain a survivor level after the first Issue played; their next level comes after playing every 2 issues after that.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Advancement and Sidekicks\n\nIf a player has a sidekick, the Sidekick advances at the same pace as their main Hero.\n\n## **\\<h2\\> PLOT TWIST!: What can the Editor-in-Chief do with Plot Points?**\n\nAs the Editor-in-Chief, we have the power to use Plot Points just like the players do. Sure, as the Editor-in-Chief, we already have the ability to bend and break the rules to tell a better story, but using the players' spent Plot Points just adds to the moment.\n\nBut here's the thing, you don't always have to be the bad guy with Plot Points. Embrace the \"rule of cool\" and surprise your players with some epic moments! You can use a Plot Point to alter the scene, even if you could have done it anyway. Spending YOUR Plot Point adds an extra performative punch. It's all about creating an atmosphere at the table that makes everyone go, \"Whoa! Heck ya\"\n\nOh, and here's another tip: use awarding Plot Points to drop hints or give the players a nudge in the right direction. It's like your secret tool to guide them through the story without giving away too much. So get creative, let those plot points fly, and don't be greedy about handing them out.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Tag Lines, Personality Flaws, and Treats\n\nWhile you **don't gain** Plot Points from utilizing a villain's Tag Lines and Personality Flaws, these are still invaluable tools for roleplaying your villains. A well-placed tagline can significantly enhance a scene.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Adjudicating Power Stunts\n\nPower stunts offer players creative and cunning ways to utilize their abilities, providing a wide range of possibilities to enhance their characters' capabilities. As the editor-in-chief, you play a crucial role in overseeing and regulating power stunts, which can significantly impact the flow of your campaign.\n\n**Player Creativity and Approval**\n\n-   Players propose a power stunt and discuss it with you.\n-   Some powers may have pre-listed power stunts, offering potential abilities or duplications of other powers without requiring those specific powers. These pre-listed power stunts are available options to characters possessing those powers, but players are not limited to those stunts alone.\n\n**\\<side bar\\>**\n\n**Optional Rule: Other sources of power stunts**\n\nComic books and shows based on comics are a great source of power stunts; if a player can show you an example of a power stunt from a published comic book or animated film, give them one free, successful use of the power stunt.\n\n**\\</side bar\\>**\n\n**Determining Stunt Feasibility**\n\n-   When facing situations outside the suggested power stunts or character listings, you, the Editor, determine the possibility of the stunt. As a rule, power stunts should never surpass the effects of the derived power, or if they do, they do so at a lower score. Remember, emulated powers are emulated at -6 of the parent power's power score.\n\n**Using Power Checks for Stunts**\n\n-   Once a power stunt is determined to be possible, the player is required to spend a plot point and roll a successful power check to perform the power stunt. They may use an additional plot point to gain Advantage on this power check.\n\n| Number of successful attempts  | DC |\n|--------------------------------|----|\n| 0                              | 20 |\n| 1-2                            | 18 |\n| 3-4                            | 16 |\n| 5-6                            | 14 |\n| 7-8                            | 12 |\n| 9-10                           | 10 |\n\n-   The player rolls their power check against a DC set by the number of successful attempts the Hero has had with a particular power stunt.\n    -   A successful role, the Hero pulls off the power stunt and gets one successful attempt.\n    -   A failed roll by 5 or less, the Hero still takes burnout but fails in their attempt, but they know it's possible.\n    -   A failed attempt by 10 or more, the Hero still takes burnout and is left in doubt that the stunt is even possible, they also suffer Disadvantage on their next check to attempt this power stunt.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Skill Challenges, telling the story\n\nSkill Sets are designed to provide players with a mechanical framework that encourages them to engage with the story, allowing them to get creative in how they justify their interactions with the scene, and fostering a bit of storytelling along the way.\n\nChallenges replace dry skill checks with opportunities to tell the story *together*, whether through triumph or dramatic failure. They are not just about rolling the dice (yes, that's part of the fun), they are about creating cinematic moments that push the narrative forward.\n\n**So, what makes a good Challenge?** Great challenges don't sound like challenges at all; they are just you describing the scene and opening the narrative door to the players. Sometimes, a \"so, what do you do?\" might be needed, but once you set the table, it's time for the players to take part.\n\nLet them tell you how they interact with the scene. Once they do, if they have not told you already, ask, \"So, how are you going to do that?\"   \n  \nThat question invites them to justify their actions through their Skill Sets and abilities. It keeps the moment grounded in the story and helps everyone stay immersed. Don't lead them to an answer; let them pitch their approach to you. If it makes sense in the fiction, roll with it. If it's clever or dramatic, even better, reward it.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Failure is an option, well, until it is.\n\nFailure is not the end of the challange, it's a new twist. Maybe the door is unlocked, but now an alarm is blaring. Maybe the mob calms down… but someone slips away to spread rumors. Failure adds drama, tension, and creates new opportunities.  \n  \nSometimes, when failure happens, give the players a chance to describe the twist, allowing them to invest in the story and tell the rest of the party what happened, and reward them with a plot point when they really \"embrace the suck\".  \n  \nAlso, remember that a player can always willingly fail to meet a challenge; if it makes for a good story, they get a plot point.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Example: A Good Challenge in Play\n\nThe players are attempting to cross an old suspension bridge at night in order to reach another part of the city. You describe the scene:\n\n*The cables groan under the weight of the wind and the years. Parts of the deck are missing entirely, and in the distance, the images of zombies reflect off the water below. The smell of rust and rot fills the air. What do you do?*\n\nOne player says, \"I'll lead the way across, testing each panel before stepping on it.\"\n\nYou nod. *\"Okay…. and how are you going to do that?\"*\n\nThey answer: *\"I'm using my Urban Explorer Skill Set, watching for signs of weakness in the structure and feeling with my feet for loose boards. I'll use Wisdom to trust my instincts about what's safe.\"*\n\nThat's perfect. You set the Difficulty based on the wind and age of the bridge, maybe 15 for a routine Challenge.\n\nThey roll and fail. But instead of saying \"you fall,\" you lean into the drama:\n\n*You hear a loud crack and feel the panel shift under your weight. You barely catch yourself, but the noise echoes out into the night. Across the river, you hear groans as the zombie horde stirs to life and starts moving toward the bridge.*\n\nFailure didn't stop the story; it escalated it. A good Challenge sets the tone, gives the player agency, and creates a new twist to deal with.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Dramatic Sequence\n\nDramatic Sequences are a narrative-driven way to present a string of challenges that allow players to engage in tense situations where their skills and abilities play a crucial role in determining the outcome. Dramatic Sequences are used to simulate complex tasks, dynamic scenes, and dramatic moments that require the heroes to meet multiple challenges to succeed.\n\n**Initiating a Dramatic Sequence**\n\n-   First, as the editor-in-chief, introduce the Dramatic Sequence when the survivor faces a situation that involves multiple obstacles or objectives to overcome. Describe the scene, set the stakes, and lay out the goals that the heroes must achieve. But don't just tell them which skill sets to use; let the players figure that out; it's part of the challenge, allowing them to think outside the box.\n\n**Challenges during a Dramatic Sequence**\n\n-   During a Dramatic Sequence, players describe their Hero's actions and propose the Skill Sets and Abilities they want to use to tackle the scene's goals.\n-   You set the Difficulty Class (DC) for each Challenge, representing how hard it is to succeed. Feel free to adjust DCs based on creativity or clever use of Skill Sets and reward smart play.\n-   Each successful Challenge \"unlocks\" the next stage of the sequence.\n-   A good Dramatic Sequence typically requires no more than three successful Challenges, though longer sequences are possible if the pacing stays tight and engaging. Too many will bog down the story.\n\n**Collaboration and Teamwork:**\n\n-   Heroes can help each other instead of rolling individually. Encourage players to justify their contributions and let everyone participate in the scene, even if they're not making the main rolls. Assisted heroes gain Advantage on their Challenge roll. You can always choose to lower the DC as well, depending on how many heroes are assisting and the quality of their assistance.\n\n**Consequences of Failure and Failing Forward:**\n\nDramatic Sequences are designed to emphasize the impact of failure, leaning into the concept of \"failing forward,\" where even unsuccessful checks can lead to interesting and dramatic outcomes. Failing forward guarantees that even in the face of failure, the story progresses, and the players remain engaged. The consequences of failure become part of the ongoing narrative, offering opportunities for new challenges and unexpected twists.\n\nWhen taking part in a Dramatic Sequence, heroes may encounter various consequences if they fail to achieve the required number of successful checks. Here are some examples of how failure can shape the narrative:\n\n-   **Setbacks and Complications:** The heroes trigger alarms, attract enemies, or set off traps that escalate the danger.\n-   **Time Constraints:** The sequence becomes more urgent, adding a ticking clock or shrinking window of opportunity.\n-   **Resource Depletion:** Ammunition, medical supplies, or other resources are burned up, forcing players to improvise.\n-   **Revisiting Successes:** The heroes might have to repeat or undo a previously successful step.\n-   **Partial Success:** They don't achieve the full goal, but gain something — a clue, a hidden route, or an edge for the next attempt.\n-   **New Obstacles or Enemies:** Their failure attracts additional threats, reinforcements, or triggers an unexpected escalation.\n-   **Compromised Cover or Stealth:** If they were trying to remain hidden, failure blows their cover and makes things harder.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Example: Dramatic Sequence in Play\n\nThe heroes are trying to evacuate a group of civilians from a collapsing hospital while keeping them calm and avoiding the Super-Z prowling the lower floors. You describe the scene:\n\n*The hospital groans under its own weight, ceiling tiles falling and lights flickering. A crowd of terrified survivors huddles in the stairwell, and from somewhere below you hear the low roar of something inhuman. The smell of smoke and dust fills the air. You've got to get these people out before the whole place comes down. What do you do?*\n\n**Stage 1: Calm the Crowd**\n\nOne player, playing Apparition, steps forward.\n\n*I'll calm them down and get them listening before they stampede or freeze up. Using my Ex-Law Enforcement Skill Set with Charisma to project calm authority and take charge.\"\"*\n\nYou nod. \"*\"Alright, DC 15 to cut through the panic and get them moving.\"\"*\n\nShe rolls, succeeds. The crowd settles, looking to her for instructions.\n\n### Stage 2: Scout the Route\n\nThe next player, playing Zero, speaks up.\n\n*\"\"I'll dart ahead and scout the route to make sure it's clear, using Urban Explorer with Wisdom to avoid debris and listen for the Super-Z.\"*\n\nYou set the DC higher here, to DC 18, due to the noise and the unstable building. He rolls and succeeds, spotting a safe route through the west wing before the creature can cut them off. He signals for the group to follow.\n\n### Stage 3: Keep the Path Open\n\nFinally, Arch-lightinng chimes in.\n\n*\"I'll stay behind the group and clear debris out of the way to keep the path open, using Strength and my Construction Worker Skill Set.\"*\n\nThis time the roll fails, but instead of stopping the scene, you lean into *failing forward*:\n\n*\"You heave a heavy beam out of the way just as the stairwell collapses behind you, but the crash echoes through the halls. Below, the roar of the Super-Z gets louder as it zeroes in on your group. You've bought time, but it's now chasing you.\"*\n\nThe team successfully evacuates the survivors, but their failure on the last stage escalates the danger for the next scene, keeping the tension high and the narrative moving.\n\n### \\<H3\\> Social Challenges\n\nIn the post-apocalyptic world of Rotted Capes, social encounters can be as impactful, if not more so, than battle against a super Z. Heroes will be dealing with other enclaves, lone wolf survivors, and their supporting Cast, all with their own motivations.\n\nRewarding good roleplaying and the use of Skill Sets in social encounters requires some balance. Some players thrive in character, delivering impressive monologues or impassioned speeches. Others are less socially outgoing and prefer to lean on their Hero's Skill Sets, describing their intended outcome, their motivations, or crafting a logical argument to justify their approach. Both are equally valid ways to play, and both deserve to shine.\n\nSome players will lean harder on their Skill Sets and mechanics; others will lean harder on their improvisation and acting. Encourage both, and reward creativity and investment wherever it comes from.\n\n**When to Call for a Social Challenge**\n\nNot every social encounter needs a roll. If the players present an irrefutable argument or the Heroes share the same goals as those they are interacting with, proceed with the story. Social Challenges should come into play when the Heroes' motivations and the people they are interacting with are in conflict, when logical arguments are insufficient, and when emotions are running high.   \n  \n**Balancing Roleplay and Skill Sets**\n\nEven in social scenes, remember: the fiction comes first. Encourage players to justify their approach using their Skill Sets and a relevant Ability.\n\nFor example:\n\n*\"I'm using my Community Organizer Skill Set with Charisma to rally the crowd to our side.\"*\n\nor\n\n*\"I'm leaning on my Silver-Tongued Scoundrel Skill Set with Intelligence to convince them this plan is in their best interest.\"*\n\nReward strong roleplay, but don't penalize players who prefer to describe rather than perform — let their Skill Sets carry them if that's their style.\n\n**Situational Modifiers in Social Challenges**\n\nBelow is a handy list of situational modifiers you can use to adjust Challenges during a social encounter. This is not exhaustive, and you should always consider the fiction and tone of the scene. And remember: sometimes, even the most persuasive Hero can't convince someone, you can't talk a frightened bystander into holding a door against a charging Super-Z.\n\n| Table 1-6: Social Encounters Situational Modifiers  |                                                                                                                                            |           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Condition                                           | Example                                                                                                                                    | Modifier  |\n| Favorable                                           | The Hero has something the target wants, there's a clear benefit to agreement, or the Hero is showing exceptional respect for local norms. | +3 or +5  |\n| Unfavorable                                         | The target has much to lose, is in a position of power, or the Hero appears ignorant, disrespectful, or desperate.                         | -3 to -5  |\n| Reputation                                          | Either the Hero or the target has a reputation that shifts the balance.                                                                    | +1        |\n| Excellent Roleplaying or solid reasoning            | Strong delivery, clever logic, or a perfectly-timed tagline.                                                                               | +5\\*      |\n\n## \\<h2\\> Time and Recovery\n\nRotted Capes doesn't track time in minutes, hours, or days. Time moves by panels, by pages, by the turn of the story. Just like in a comic book, what matters isn't how long something takes on a clock, it's when the tone shifts, when the focus moves, when the narrative demands a new beat.\n\nAlthough these units feel narrative in nature, they serve a hard mechanical purpose: the recovery of resources depending on the time passed.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Scenes\n\nA scene is a distinct narrative moment focused on a single conflict, goal, or location. A fight in a parking garage is a scene. Negotiating a truce between two factions? Another scene. As soon as the action shifts, combat ends, the heroes change locations, or the stakes transform, the scene ends, and a new one begins.\n\nScenes are **THE** foundation of the game's pacing. Bunout, flaws, features, and some powers refresh when a new scene begins. A scene doesn't care how much time has passed in-universe; it's about the story beat, the page turn.\n\nWhen in doubt, treat any clear narrative shift as the start of a new scene.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Hiatus\n\nA Hiatus is more than just a pause… It's genuine downtime. Sleep. Shelter. A secure space to let your guard down. A Hiatus usually happens between scenes or might be a scene in itself, such as camping overnight in a tall building looking over the dark, quiet city below.\n\nDuring a Hiatus, heroes recover all their Stamina, some conditions, such as Exhaustion, as well as all features recovered after completing a scene.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\> Optional Rule: Brutal Continuity, Healing\n\nFor groups who want a darker, more punishing game, the Editor-in-Chief may enable Brutal Continuity.\n\nIn Brutal Continuity, Burnout is not automatically cleared at the end of a scene. Instead, it is reduced by 5 points. Any remaining Burnout can only be cleared by taking a Hiatus. Likewise, Stamina does not recover at the end of a scene; it only comes back during a Hiatus. This optional rule makes survival feel heavier and risk more permanent. It's not for every campaign, but when you want the heroes to feel like they're one bad decision away from collapse, it hits the tone perfectly.\n\nBrutal Continuity works well in early-stage campaigns, horror arcs, or storylines where recovery is scarce. Every retreat feels earned. And when a hero finally rises to face the odds again, it means something.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\> Enclave Interludes\n\nBetween Issues, when the smoke clears and the next crisis hasn't yet begun, heroes may engage in an Enclave Interlude. These are the narrative lulls in the series, days or weeks spent within the safety of their hotel or hideout, focused on long-term goals, personal growth, and keeping their community alive.\n\nDuring an Enclave Interlude, heroes can train allies, craft new gear, pursue research, or shape the direction of the enclave. This is when they fix generators, train bystanders, plot new alliances, and follow through on personal arcs. Interludes can be quiet or dramatic. They may grant temporary benefits to the next Issue, or if pursued over time, lead to permanent upgrades to Facilities, new capabilities, or even the acquisition of new feats and powers.\n\nThis is where the world breathes. This is where the story slows down just long enough to show what the heroes are fighting for. Editors should use Interludes to spotlight character development, shape future storylines, and ground the drama in something worth saving.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Running Hazards\n\n### \\<h3\\>Contaminated Food and Water\n\nThere will be times when heroes encounter contaminated supplies. A hero may attempt to avoid illness by making a Constitution-based ability check, applying a relevant Skill Set such as *Outdoorsman*, *Urban Forager*, or similar, at the Editor-in-Chief's discretion. Contaminated food and water can cause damage over time or impose Conditions such as *Exhaustion*, *Blindness*, or *Weakened*\n\nThese encounters are not meant to be \"gotcha\" traps. If the players are diligent about checking food and cleaning water, let them know they've avoided possible contamination on occasion to acknowledge their smart play.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Disease\n\nAn aspect rarely touched upon in the classic superhero genre is that of disease, but not so in *Rotted Capes*. Although the threat of being infected by the Z-Virus is a constant, it's not the only disease the Heroes have to worry about.\n\nAt the onset of the disease, roll an attack against the survivor's *Fortitude.* If it successfully hits, the target is infected and suffers the initial effects of the disease. After the allotted amount of time, the survivor must perform a Constitution Saving Throw against that disease stage's DC; a failed roll advances the victim to the next stage of infection, and so on. A successful Saving Throw moves the target up the track; if the target succeeds in his Saving Throw against the initial infection, he shakes off the disease.\n\nInfection tracks can be 2 to 4 levels in length; the survivor only suffers damage from any particular stage of infection once and may not heal damage dealt by a disease until cured. Lastly, some diseases may require a specific cure, in which case a target cannot shrug off the disease and remains in the initial infection state until the cure is administered.\n\nPlayers may add Plot Points to gain Advantage on their saving throw against a disease.\n\n**Word on Antibiotics:** While most antibiotics have lost much of their potency in the years following Z-Day, they remain highly useful. If a survivor has access to antibiotics when attempting to fight off a disease, they gain a +5 bonus to their Saving Throws.\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Contaminated Food / Water Poisoning (Disease)\n\nFoodborne illnesses, of which there are many, are the most common diseases suffered after Z'day. When any creature consumes contaminated food, it may experience the following consequences.\n\n**Attack:** +5 (Fortitude)\n\n**Resistance:** Challenging (DC: 15)\n\n**Infection Track:**\n\n-   *Initial infection (1 day):* The victim starts to suffer stomach pains and gains 1 level of Exhaustion.\n-   *Advanced stage (2 days):* The victim starts having fits of vomiting, and the victim gains an additional level of Exhaustion. Additionally, during a scene, the editor-in-chief may call for a DC: 20 Constitution Saving Throw; if they fail this Saving Throw, they are *Stunned (Lesser)* and start to vomit. At the end of each of their turns, they can make a new saving throw to end this effect. Alternatively, the Survivor can instantly resist by using a plot point.\n-   *Final stage (2 Days):* The situation has become untenable; the victim suffers an additional level of Exhaustion and can not hold down food or water. They are prone and restrained and suffer 1 wound of damage at the beginning of each day. At the end of every day, they may make a new Saving throw to move up 1 stage. If they do, they are out of danger, and each day move up an additional stage.\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Gangrene, Dry (Disease)\n\nGangrene is a serious condition that arises when a considerable mass of body tissue dies. Gangrene has become a leading cause of death, only surpassed by zombie attacks.\n\nAny time a survivor suffers a Wound of damage and does not later clean and bandage it, there is a chance the Wound gets infected.\n\n**Attack:** +6 (Fortitude)\n\n**Resistance:** Challenging (DC: 20)\n\n**Infection Track:**\n\n-   *Initial infection (2 days):* The victim's skin starts to harden around the Wound and begins to smell like almonds; the victim suffers 2d6 Stamina.\n-   *Advanced stage (2 days):* The victim starts to lose all feeling around the original Wound; the smell becomes quite noticeable at this stage. The victim suffers 1 Wound.\n-   *Final stage (2 Days):* The infection has started to reach the bloodstream; alas, it's only a matter of time. The victim suffers 2 Wounds and is *Restrained (Immobilized).* If he fails his next Saving Throw, the victim dies.\n\n**Optional effects of contaminated food or water:** Instead of death, the editor-in-chief can have the victim go blind or suffer some other permanent effect, such as a reduction to their base pace or penalty to saving throws to resist future infection, \"having a soft stomach.\"\n\n#### \\<h4\\>The Z-Virus\n\nWhenever a survivor receives a Wound from a zombie's bite or natural (physical) melee attack (like claws), there is a chance of infection.\n\nThe Z-virus functions like any other disease, with a few notable exceptions. First, the virus is 100% resistant to all known antiviral drugs. Second, the disease's initial attack gains a bonus, and Resistance DC is based on the victim's condition at the time of possible infection.\n\n-   \\+2 for each Wound currently being suffered by the creature.\n-   \\+4 if the creature is knocked unconscious due to Stamina damage.\n-   \\+4 if the creature is a Superhuman with any inborn power above a score of 20.\n\n**Attack:** +10 (Fortitude)\n\n**Resistance:** Challenging (DC: 20)\n\n**Infection Track:**\n\n-   Initial infection (1 Hour): The skin around the initial Wound is surrounded by an ash-white patch. Although a normal victim does not suffer any damage at this stage, Superhumans will start to feel lightheaded and gain 1 level of Exhaustion.\n-   Incubation Stage (2 hours): The ash-white patch upon the victim's skin starts to spread as the Wound itself becomes painfully dry. The victim suffers 2d10 Stamina and gains 1 level of Exhaustion\n-   Advanced stage (1 day, or 3 hours if superhuman): The victim starts to lose all feeling around the original Wound. Normal victims now suffer 1 Wound, while Superhumans suffer 2 Wounds.\n-   Final stage (2 Days): The infection has reached its final stage; if the victim is not dead, they are now.\n\n**Death and the Z-Virus:** If a victim is killed by the Z-Virus or killed while infected by the Z-Virus, they rise 1 turn later as a Zombie. Superhumans rise as Super-Zombies under Editor-in-Chief control.\n\n**Cure and Treatment:** This affliction attacks at the cellular level, so amputation is an effective cure. Amputation, however, leaves one particularly vulnerable in a zombie apocalypse, so most victims opt for the almost as effective alternative: burning.\n\nDuring the Initial and Incubation stages, the victim may opt to burn the Wound in an attempt to stop the disease from spreading. If they do so, they suffer a Wound from the initial burn but gain a second Saving Throw with Advantage. If they succeed at this roll, the infection is killed, with any accumulated penalties fading with proper healing within 24 hours.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Weather\n\nYou will notice that no hard and fast rules are presented here, as the weather can serve as a powerful narrative tool and be effectively used in the telling of the story. Use weather to reinforce the post-apocalyptic atmosphere and create opportunities for great storytelling.\n\nWeather, like powers, possesses an ability score, which measures the intensity of the event. For example, hurricane-force winds would be equivalent to moving an object of 30, with a +10 bonus to power checks, and a passive power DC of 20.\n\n**Acid Rain (Energy Generation: Acid):** The skies darken, and acidic precipitation falls upon the survivors' enclave. For each round spent in the open, Heroes must make a Constitution Saving Throw to resist the corrosive effects.\n\n**High Winds (Move Object):** Our heroes find themselves battered by powerful gusts. For each round spent in the open, Survivors must make a Strength Saving Throw or become prone or shoved into an adjacent area. High Winds can also carry harmful debris, causing damage or imposing penalties on pace and ranged attacks.\n\n**Electrical Storm (Energy Bolt: Electricity):** A violent storm engulfs the skies, accompanied by crackling lightning and booming thunder. Survivors caught in the open are at risk of being struck by lightning, taking significant damage, or suffering debilitating effects.\n\n**Blinding Sandstorm (Move Object, Secondary effect: Blindness):** An immense sandstorm whips across the landscape, creating a hostile environment where visibility is reduced to mere feet. Survivors must make Navigation checks to avoid becoming disoriented or lost. The sandstorm can also carry harmful debris, causing damage, slowing your pace, and hindering ranged attacks.\n\n**Freezing Cold (Energy Generation: Cold):** Bitter cold grips the city, turning survival into a race against frostbite and hypothermia. Survivors must find shelter or protective clothing to stave off the freezing temperatures. Exposure to the cold for prolonged periods can lead to Exhaustion or even death.\n\n**Sweltering Heatwave** **(Energy Generation: Heat):** Intense heat envelops the city. Survivors must manage their hydration and avoid heatstroke, seeking shade and water sources to survive. The heatwave can also heighten tensions among survivors, leading to conflicts and desperate resource competition.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Holding ones Breath & Underwater Combat\n\nUnderwater environments pose unique challenges to survivors, requiring them to navigate both the dangers of combat and the limits of their breath. Here are the rules for holding your breath and underwater combat:\n\n**Holding Your Breath**\n\n-   Creatures can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to their Constitution score before needing to make a Constitution saving throw to continue holding it.\n-   Each round spent holding breath beyond their Constitution score, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw. The DC increases by 2 for each subsequent round.\n-   If a creature fails the Saving Throw, it begins to suffocate and must make another Saving Throw on its subsequent turns until it can breathe again.\n-   Once a creature reaches 0 stamina while suffocating, it falls unconscious and starts taking wound damage, 1 wound every turn it stays submerged in the water. Wounds suffered from suffocation are recovered when the heroes complete a Hiatus.\n\n**Underwater Combat:**\n\n-   **Movement:** Creatures with a swim pace can move freely through the water without penalty.\n-   **Limited Movement:** Creatures without a Swim pace move at half their normal pace while underwater.\n-   **Range and Attacks:** Ranged attacks made underwater have their range halved unless they have the Aquatic power modification. Melee attacks are unaffected.\n-   **Visibility:** The visibility underwater is reduced, imposing Disadvantage on wisdom checks to notice things and ranged attacks made beyond a certain distance at the Editor's discretion.\n-   **Environmental Hazards:** Underwater combat may include hazards like strong currents, pressure, or aquatic creatures. You might be required to meet challenges to swim in difficult conditions.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Fire & Ice\n\n**Fire:**\n\nFires, like all other energy sources, would have a power score; you may have controlled flames or flames that are totally out of control; here we are discussing the latter. Areas on fire would have a power score, with the most intense fires receiving a score of 24 to 30 for raging flames. Creatures take the fire's base dice in fire damage any time they start a turn within an area *on fire.* Creatures in adjacent areas suffer half this damage for starting a turn in an area adjacent to an area *on fire.*\n\nFire, if not controlled, will spread into adjacent areas with combustible materials every turn.\n\nA fire's intensity can be reduced by the use of powers and equipment (a fire extinguisher, for example). These are commonly performed as a skill check or power check against the DC set by the fire's intensity.\n\n| **Fire intensity** | **DC  to combat** | **Power Check to break items.** |\n|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 10-15              | 10                | +8                              |\n| 16-19              | 15                | +9                              |\n| 20-23              | 20                | +10                             |\n| 24-30              | 25                | +15                             |\n\n**Effects of fire on materials**  \nIf a flame's power score is less than the MS of an object, it does not harm the object. The object may still retain its heat. A sword sitting in an open flame may not start immediately melting, but it would burn anyone dumb enough to grab it.\n\nIf the flame's power score is greater than that of the MS of the item in question, roll a power check for the fire against a DC equal to the MS of the object in question. If it suffers enough hits, it's broken (see Attacking and Destroying Objects pg XX)\n\nIce: Ice has an MS per inch as described under Attacking and Destroying Objects, pg XX Powers may create a stronger \"more compact\" form of ice, in which case, use the power's power score as the ice's MS, requiring the same number of hits as regular ice.\n\nProlonged exposure to ice and other freezing conditions results in the survivor suffering levels of Exhaustion, commonly one level of Exhaustion for every hour of direct exposure, although extreme temperatures may accelerate this process.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Optional Rules: Psychosis, the lingering effects of madness\n\nIn the bleak world of Rotted Capes, the relentless horrors of the zombie apocalypse can take a toll on the survivors' sanity. These rules introduce a mechanic to reflect the psychological strain and potential descent into madness faced by your players' heroes.\n\nThe following rules represent a gradual descent into madness, with increasingly severe consequences. Please note that this system is not designed to represent real mental illness, as such a system would be far too complex and nuanced and really has no place in a roleplaying game.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Going Mad: A descent into madness.\n\nWhen the mind is exposed to unthinkable levels of stress, whether through environmental events, exposure to unimaginable horrors, or mental attacks, it creates fractures in the creature's psyche. Psychosis, much like Exhaustion, is measured in six levels, with each level representing more severe damage to the mind. Anything that can cause madness also grants one or more levels of psychosis.\n\n\\<h3\\>Psychosis\n\n| \\<b\\>Level\\</b\\> | \\<b\\>Effect\\</b\\>              | \\<b\\>Diagnose\\</b\\> | \\<b\\>Treating Psychosis\\</b\\> |\n|------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1                | —                              | 20                  | Time, Treatment               |\n| 2                | Psychotic compulsion           | 15                  | Time, Treatment               |\n| 3                | Unstable mind                  | 14                  | Time, Treatment               |\n| 4                | Permanent psychotic compulsion | 13                  | Powers, Treatment             |\n| 5                | Shattered mind                 | 12                  | Powers, Treatment             |\n| 6                | Permanent madness              | 10                  | Temporary Reprieve            |\n\n**\\<h3\\>Gaining levels of Psychosis.**\n\nThere are several ways to gain levels of Psychosis.\n\n-   Any creature that is subject to a critical strike from a power that deals with psychic damage gains 1 level of psychosis. If the target of the power \\<i\\>*mind control*\\</i\\>, especially its power stunt \\<i\\>*modify memory\\</i\\>* rolls a natural 1 on the Wisdom saving throw, they take one level of psychosis.\n-   Any effect that gives a creature either a temporary or permanent form of madness also gives 1 or 3 levels of psychosis, respectively.\n-   Also, effects from things like ancient artifacts, diseases, poisons, and magical effects from alien dimensions can all inflict psychosis.\n\nA creature immune to psychic damage cannot gain further levels of psychosis but retains any levels already possessed. A creature with any resistance to psychic damage gets Advantage on saving throws to resist gaining levels of psychosis.\n\n### \\<h3\\>The Effects of Psychosis\n\nAs individuals gain levels of psychosis, they suffer the effects noted in the table above, with all effects being cumulative. Levels of psychosis do not dissipate once the duration of a madness effect has passed, but remain, representing the damaged condition of the creature's psyche.\n\n**\\<b\\>Psychotic Compulsion:\\</b\\>** These are uncontrollable habits developed by the character. Perhaps the creature develops an uncontrollable chuckle, an irrational fear of snakes, an irrational attachment to a lucky charm, or low-level paranoia. These effects are not meant to be crippling, but rather serve as a roleplaying effect. The Editor-in-Chief can require a player to spend a plot point to push past or control their compulsion for an hour. The psychotic compulsion remains until the creature is healed of all levels of psychosis.\n\n**\\<b\\>Permanent Psychotic Compulsion:\\</b\\>** Upon reaching 4 levels of psychosis, the creature gains a psychotic compulsion that can never be removed without the help of powers such as the power stunt from the \\<i\\>*heal*\\</i\\> power *\\<i\\>repair the psyche\\</i\\>.* If a creature suffering from a permanent psychotic compulsion suffers enough levels of psychosis to gain a psychotic compulsion, it will suffer from both. A creature can suffer multiple permanent psychotic compulsions.\n\n\\<bi\\>Example of Psychotic Compulsions:\\</bi\\>\n\n\\<Start_Table\\>\n\n|    | Roll d10                                                                                   |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | Becomes easily agitated by a particular action performed by others.                        |\n| 2  | Becomes easily frustrated by the smallest setbacks.                                        |\n| 3  | Compulsive habit (armor must always be shined, sets their table just right before dinner). |\n| 4  | Constantly chuckles and mumbles to themself.                                               |\n| 5  | They constantly play with their hair or other objects.                                     |\n| 6  | Develops an attachment to an object, such as their lucky rabbit's foot.                    |\n| 7  | Develop an irrational fear of something (spiders, for example).                            |\n| 8  | Has especially vivid dreams/nightmares that leave them feeling uneasy.                     |\n| 9  | It gnaws at them when they come across something asymmetrical.                             |\n| 10 | They are plagued by the feeling of déjà vu or the feeling they are being watched.          |\n\n\\</table\\>\n\n**\\<b\\>Unstable Mind:\\</b\\>** An interesting side effect of psychosis is the acceptance of things that may fracture more stable minds. Creatures with unstable minds gain a +2 bonus to any saves and defenses to resist any effect that grants madness.\n\n**\\<b\\>Shattered Mind:\\</b\\>** individuals that have reached this level of psychosis suffer from an additional \\<i\\>*psychotic compulsion\\<i/\\>* and gain a temporary madness effect. Additionally, if you are exposed to any effect that would grant madness, you automatically fail your saving throw to resist it, or in the case of an attack, your willpower is reduced to 10 to resist that attack.\n\n**\\<b\\>Permanent Madness: \\</b\\>**The creature suffers from a madness that cannot be cured by any known means.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Editor's Option: Tailored Madness Effects\n\nCore rules provide a random collection of effects, but many times, the Editor may roll a random madness effect that really has little to do with the event that caused the madness. Instead of randomly rolling for random madness, tailor the psychotic compulsion to the individual or to the event that caused the psychological damage in the first place.\n\n\\< sidebar\\>\n\n#### \\<h4\\> StatMonkey's Advice: A Different Point of View\n\nThose affected with levels of psychosis possess a different way of seeing the world, as such creatures may come across things that can only be understood by someone with psychosis levels. This can make for interesting puzzles or explain why can understand the \"rambling notes of a madman\".\n\n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>**Diagnosis**\n\nA hero with an appropriate Skill Set (e.g., Combat Medic, Therapist, Occult Scholar) can attempt a Skill Check against the table DC to identify a target's psychosis level and nature.  \n  \nWhen a creature suffering from a psychotic compulsion is observed by a creature with an appropriate Skill Set (e.g., Combat Medic, Therapist, Occult Scholar) they can me asked to meet a challenge against the DC in the chart above to recognize the creature is suffering from a psychotic condition. If the creature surpasses the DC by 5 or more, the creature also determines the levels of psychosis the target creature is suffering from.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Treating Psychosis\n\nThere are three methods of treating psychosis: Time, Treatment, and Powers.\n\n**Time:** A survivor can use out-of-frame activities to recover from the trauma they faced, requiring a number of Enclave Interudes equal to the level of psychosis they currently possess. Afterward, the creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the levels in psychosis +10, and a successful Saving throw reduces the creature's level of psychosis by one. If the character rolls a 1 on their saving throw, they gain an additional level of psychosis.\n\n**Treatment:** If the survivor is also receiving Treatment during this process (as in another individual with an appropriate skill using their Enclave Interudes to treat them) they get Advantage on their saving throw to reduce their levels in psychosis.\n\n**Powers:** A far safer and more assured method of curing psychosis is through the use of the healing power stunt *to heal the psyche; after completing a Hiatus, this power trick can reduce an* individual's psychosis level by 1.\n\n**Temporary Reprieve:** When a creature reaches 6 levels of psychosis, there is nothing that can be done to cure such a break to its psyche. At this level of damage, powers and treatment can provide only a reprieve from the effects of psychosis. An individual treated with a power or successfully receives treatment and makes their saving throw finds that their indefinite madness is suppressed for 1d4+1 days.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Player's Advice: lingering effects\n\nBeing treated is not the end of the story, and as a player, you may choose to have the events that caused you to suffer from psychosis continue to affect you far beyond the time required to recover from it. In literature, many comic Heroes carry the scars of past events, so don't let the removal of levels of psychosis stop you from telling a good story. Recovering from psychosis does not necessarily mean you have forgotten or put those events behind you, as recovering from psychosis can represent a refortification of your psyche against further damage.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Going Mad\n\nWhile there are exterior effects that may inflict a madness effect directly upon an individual (giving them levels of psychosis in the process), the most common way of gaining a madness effect is through the acquisition of levels of psychosis.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Madness Effects\n\nMadness can be temporary or permanent.\n\nAn individual afflicted with **\\<b\\>temporary madness\\</b\\>** gains a madness effect that lasts 1d10 × 10 days; those afflicted with temporary madness can be treated through the use of powers or through receiving treatment during an Enclave Interlude. An afflicted individual only needs one Enclave Interlude while being treated by someone possessing an appropriate skill set (psychologist/counselor) to remove a temporary insanity before the next Issue.\n\nAn individual afflicted with \\<**b\\>** **Permanent madness\\</b\\>** gains a new weakness from a permanent, incurable madness from the table below.\n\n| 2d20 | Madness Effect

32   | *Recklessness:* The individual becomes dangerously impulsive, disregarding their own safety and acting without forethought.                                                                 |\n|

34   | *Sleepwalking:* The individual engages in complex actions and movement while asleep, unaware of their actions upon waking.                                                                  |\n| 35   | *Compulsive Counting:* The individual develops an obsessive need to count objects or perform repetitive actions.                                                                            |\n|

|\n\n## \\<h2\\> Utilizing Resource Scarcity\n\nRotted Capes does not require detailed resource management; ammo rules are abstract, and we don't track meals and water precisely. Resource shortages are treated more like a story beat than a hard mechanic. There are countless ways to utilize implied scarcity in your games, but here are just a few.   \n  \n**Story Hooks:** The most common way to bring resource security to the forefront is by using it as a story hook in your issues. Use it as a way to get your heroes out of the hotel into the streets, where they might stumble upon the story hooks, or the entire focus of the Issue might be recovering or discovering resources they need… raiding a hospital in the hopes of stocking up on medical supplies, or going deep into a Z infected area to an old solar panel manufacturing facility, or checking out an old superhero headquarters in the hopes they could find something useful for their enclave.\n\n**Resource as Reward:** Playing into the above, the scarcity of resources provides a way to make rewards more meaningful. When the players complete an issue, reward them with limited supplies, useful equipment, or a cache of ammunition. However, ensure that these rewards feel valuable and earned.\n\n**Trade and Bartering:** Encourage the players to engage in trade and bartering with bystanders from other enclaves or even members of their own. Let them trade their skills or valuable items for items they want.\n\n**Crafting and Improvisation:** Encourage the players to craft their own equipment or improvise tools from available resources during an Enclave Interlude. Doing so can directly benefit them by giving them access to new powers when they get their next feat or as a way for them to affect their enclave's characteristics. For instance, they can create makeshift weapons, traps, or armor from salvaged materials, improving the hotel's security characteristics.\n\n## \\<h2\\>The Cast\n\nThe Cast is a collection of survivors controlled by the Editor-in-Chief, rather than one of the players, but this may not always be the case. The Cast consists of the survivors your players interact with on a constant basis and is just as much part of the story, if not more so, than the super Zs your players face off against.\n\nIn Rotted Capes, the Cast is split into three categories: Bystanders, Supporting Cast, and Sidekicks. Bystanders are common survivors that the players will encounter throughout their adventures. They may be scavengers, cultists, or a group of civilians in need of rescue. Bystanders typically have minimal skills, but they can still play an important role in supporting the enclave. They may provide valuable information and resources or serve as an extra set of hands to help with tasks.\n\nSupporting Cast, on the other hand, are highly trained or very useful survivors who are personally connected to one of the players' heroes. These survivors can be family members, friends, or allies. They have their own motivations and goals that may intersect with the players' objectives. Supporting cast members are more fleshed out than bystanders, and they have unique personalities, skill sets, and abilities. They may even have their own story arcs that develop over time.\n\nLastly, we have the Sidekick. Sidekicks are low-powered heroes who are personally connected to one of the player's heroes and may offer assistance during Issues. While they may not be as skilled or powerful as the heroes, they can still provide valuable support and a unique perspective on the world. Sidekicks are notorious for having a mind of their own and can sometimes be more trouble than they're worth. They may venture outside the enclave on their own or act independently at the most inopportune times, potentially putting themselves and others in danger. Despite their unpredictable nature, many of the heroes in Rotted Capes started as Sidekicks themselves, so taking on a Sidekick can be a way for players to pass on their knowledge and skills to the next generation of survivors. Just make sure they give the heroes a few headaches along the way.  \n  \n\\<side bar\\>\n\n**\\<h4\\> Word from the Editor: Multiple Sidekicks**  \nYou may very well end up with a party full of sidekicks, which can quickly become a headache for the editor-in-chief. In these cases, only allow one Hero to take their Sidekick with them during an issue, and maybe even have the players swap out Sidekicks if the story allows.   \n  \nHaving a lot of Sidekicks can be a LOT of fun if used correctly; maybe they constantly try to one-up each other or get the bright idea to form their own team (unbeknownst to the heroes) and venture out of the enclave. Perhaps you could even have the players play all their sidekicks as part of an issue or swap out their main Hero for one of their sidekicks.   \n\\</side bar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\> Using the Cast\n\nThe Cast is your best tool to make the world feel alive. Use them to add drama, tension, or levity: a Supporting Cast member's secret surfacing at the wrong time, a Bystander begging for help in the middle of a battle, or a long-lost loved one stepping out of the crowd.\n\nLet players occasionally control Cast members during split-party scenes, flashbacks, or enclave-side stories. At the same time, the heroes are away, allowing everyone to stay engaged and explore the world from different perspectives.\n\nThe right Cast moment can be as memorable as any climactic fight. Don't waste the opportunity.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Building your Cast\n\nThere are three ways to build out your Cast, and as the editor-in-chief, you can build out your Cast. Point Buy, Standard Arrays, or grab a simple stat block.\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Point Buy and Standard Arrays\n\nOne of the ways you can build out your cast members is by arranging the following stat arrays, or if you wish to build out some more unique cast members, you can always go with the point buy method.\n\nWhen using point buy\n\n-   Bystander, you cannot start with a common background skill set.\n-   Supporting Cast, use points for a hardened level threat. They have one skill set and one feat.\n-   Follow the rules for character creation, but replace build points as noted below as if the Sidekick were a Zeta-level threat.\n\n| **Treat/ Power Level** | **Ability Pts** | **Ability Array** | **Power Pts** | **Power Arrays**    | **Rank Bonus** |\n|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| Bystander              | 20              | 14,12,12,11,10,9  | N/A           | N/A                 | +1             |\n| Hardened               | 26              | 15,14,13,12,10,9  | N/A           | N/A                 | +1             |\n| Zeta                   | 33              | 16,15,14,12,11,10 | 14            | 16,14 *or* 14,14,12 | +1             |\n\n### **Common Background Skill Sets**\n\nThese Skill Sets are available to all Bystanders\n\n-   **Caretaker** (basic first aid, childcare, community support)\n-   **Teacher** (history, critical thinking, organizing people)\n-   **Handyman** (simple repair, tool use, fix-it knowledge)\n-   **Cook** (meal planning, food preservation, basic chemistry)\n-   **Custodian** (scavenging, cleaning chemicals, building familiarity)\n-   **Retail Worker** (bartering, crowd management, survival in chaos)\n-   **Farmhand** (animal handling, gardening, weather sense)\n-   **Librarian** (research, knowledge of obscure topics, filing systems)\n-   **Bus Driver** (vehicle familiarity, basic navigation)\n-   **Janitor** (lock keys, maintenance shortcuts, problem-solving)\n-   **Parent** (emotional support, multitasking, comfort)\n-   **Veteran** *(but not Special Forces)* (basic first aid, discipline, simple tactics, firearms safety)\n\n#### \\<h4\\>Modifying Stat blocks\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to pick a common survivor stat block or a hardened survivor stat block, which can be found below in the Adversary Archive chapter. Feel free to modify those stat blocks as you see fit, move around ability scores, change out equipment, or modify skill sets. Don't worry, we won't tell anyone.   \n  \n\\<Sidebar\\>\n\n#### \\<h4\\>You don't have to stat them all!\n\nKeep in mind you do not have to fully stat out every cast member; in fact, you shouldn't keep some things vague; it gives you flexibility later as you are not tied down to static stats… It's a common trope for the heroes to learn something new about a survivor later in the story.  \n  \n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n## \\<h2\\>Building Encounters\n\nThere's no rigid encounter balancing system in *Rotted Capes*… this is by design. As Editor-in-Chief, it's your job to read the table, feel the heroes' capabilities, and craft scenes that challenge them in ways that fit the story. Don't be afraid to tweak or even rewrite threat stat blocks on the fly. This is as much about cinematic, comic-book drama as it is about crunchy dice rolls and zombie headshots.\n\nSometimes the heroes should feel over their heads; it's a classic moment in comics. Just make sure they have a chance to win, escape, or pay a meaningful price. If you *do* plan for them to fail? Make it count. Losing the battle makes the eventual comeback that much sweeter.\n\nThreat ranks are loosely inspired by the same danger-level categories used to classify supers before Z-Day. Survivors have adopted them to warn each other about super-zombies and villains lurking out there. Everyone knows to avoid an Alpha-level Z, and you *run* when an Omega-level threat shows up.\n\nBecause Rotted Capes intentionally allows heroes to be built with flavor and flexibility, no hard math will ever fit every group. A team of min-maxed powerhouses can plow through encounters that would terrify a more narrative-driven, \"flawed\" party. As a general guideline:\n\n-   A starting-level hero can usually solo a threat **one Rank above** their own.\n-   A full team of heroes can tackle threats **two to three Ranks above**.\n-   A skilled, coordinated team might even take down a threat **four Ranks above**, if they play smart and get lucky.\n\nBut the sweet spot? Somewhere within two to three Ranks of the team's level. That's where most parties will feel tension, and where the win feels earned.\n\nDon't overthink the math, use the rules to tell a story, lean into it, adjust as needed, and make the fight memorable.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Threat Creation\n\nWithin the grim panels of Rotted Capes, threats should feel larger than life, or unlife, while remaining fast and easy for the Editor to run. The *Threat Creation System* empowers you, the Editor, to craft cinematic, genre-appropriate challenges.\n\nThis system prioritizes Editor-friendliness or static crunchiness, empowering you to create memorable traits that deliver a narrative impact over complex statistics. Every threat, big or small, should feel like a story worth telling.\n\nUse this guide to quickly create balanced, dramatic threats that fit seamlessly into your game.\n\n### \\<h3\\>How to create a threat\n\nCreating a threat in Rotted Capes is a straightforward process that allows for some creativity.   \n  \n**1. Choose the Threat's Rank**\n\nDecide the threat's Rank, from Bystander to Omega, based on its narrative role and level of danger. Refer to the Threat Parameters Table (p. XX) for baseline values appropriate to each Rank. Most minor threats fall into Zeta or Epsilon, while major villains or apex predators may climb as high as Beta, Alpha, or beyond.\n\n**2. Reference the Threat Parameters Table**\n\nUse the *Threat Parameters Table* to set the following baseline stats:\n\n-   **Defenses** (Primary / Secondary / Tertiary)\n-   **Attack bonuses**\n-   **Stamina and Wounds**\n-   Typical damage output (min–max and average)\n\nThese are a recommended starting point; adjust slightly if needed to fit your scene or the threat's narrative role.\n\n**3. Assign a Role**\n\nPick a **Role** (e.g., Bruiser, Controller, Ranged, Minion, Lurker) that defines how this threat behaves in an encounter. Each Role comes with suggested stat tweaks, narrative hooks, and tactics. For example, a Bruiser hits hard and soaks damage, while a Controller specializes in disrupting heroes.\n\n**4. Determine Size**\n\nDecide the threat's **Size** (Tiny, Medium, Large, etc.) and apply any relevant modifiers. Larger threats are more imposing, harder to move, and often have extended reach.\n\n**5. Select a Type**\n\nAssign the threat's **Type,** Origin, Survivor, Animal, Abomination, Construct, etc., which informs its nature, traits, and how powers interact with it.\n\n**6. Add Traits**\n\nCreate 2–5 **Traits** to give the threat personality and mechanical bite. Traits are narrative-forward abilities that make the threat memorable while providing clear mechanical effects.\n\nIf you adapt a Power into a Trait, note the Power Score or Rank it represents (so that powers like Mimic or contests can interact with it).\n\nFor particularly complex threats, you may also include a simple list of Powers and their Ranks, even if they're streamlined into Traits for play.\n\n**7. Create Skill Sets**\n\nCreate one or two Skill Sets reflecting the threat's training or instincts. Most threats have a single Skill Set, but highly trained or intelligent (Intelligence 20+) threats may have two or more, if appropriate to the story.\n\n**8. Set Ability Scores**\n\nAssign **ability scores** that fit the threat's concept, Rank, and narrative role. There is no single \"correct\" method; use what works for you and the story.\n\nYou can either:\n\n-   Start with ability scores that feel right for the threat's concept, then calculate saves and defenses from them.\n-   Or start defenses you want the threat to have, and backfill the ability scores to match.\n\nEither approach is valid, as long as the threat's ability scores remain within its Rank Cap (see Threat Parameters Table) and feel narratively appropriate.\n\nFor example, if you want an Epsilon-level threat's Strength save to be around +7, you might choose Strength 20 (+5) and let the Rank bonus (+2) bring it to +7. Or you could pick the save you want first, then choose a Strength score that supports it.\n\nStay within Rank Cap limits, keep the numbers reasonable for the threat's Rank and Role, and focus on what makes the scene exciting.\n\n**9. Apply Templates (Optional)**\n\nIf the threat is a **Zombie** or otherwise mutated, apply the appropriate Template while keeping its original Type and Role. Templates adjust behavior, defenses, and vulnerabilities to match genre expectations.\n\n| Table X-X Treat Parameters  |           |            |          |            |        |            |                  |                |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|------------|----------|------------|--------|------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Rank                        | Rank Cap  | Rank Bonus | Defenses | Durability | Attack |            |                  |                |\n|                             |           |            | P/S/T    | Stamina    | Wounds | To hit S/A | Damage (Average) |                |\n| ¼                           | Bystander | 20         | +1       | 14/12/09   | 10     | 1          | +5 / +2          | 3–12 (avg 6)   |\n| ½                           | Hardened  | 20         | +1       | 13/13/09   | 20     | 1          | +6 / +3          | 4–13 (avg 8)   |\n| 1                           | Zeta      | 20         | +1       | 15/13/10   | 30     | 2          | +7 / +4          | 7–17 (avg 11)  |\n| 2                           | Epsilon\\* | 23         | +2       | 17/15/11   | 30     | 3          | +8 / +5          | 8–18 (avg 12)  |\n| 3                           | Delta     | 26         | +3       | 20/17/12   | 36     | 3          | +11 / +8         | 10–22 (avg 14) |\n| 4                           | Gamma     | 29         | +4       | 22/19/13   | 54     | 3          | +13 / +10        | 11–27 (avg 17) |\n| 5                           | Beta      | 33         | +5       | 25/21/14   | 66     | 3          | +16 / +13        | 12–30 (avg 19) |\n| 6                           | Alpha     | 36         | +6       | 28/23/15   | 78     | 3          | +19 / +16        | 13–33 (avg 21) |\n| 7                           | Theta     | 40         | +7       | 31/25/16   | 87     | 3          | +22 / +19        | 14–36 (avg 23) |\n| 8                           | Sigma     | 43         | +8       | 33/27/17   | 120    | 4          | +24 / +21        | 16–40 (avg 25) |\n| 9                           | Upsilon   | 46         | +9       | 36/29/18   | 160    | 5          | +27 / +24        | 20–50 (avg 30) |\n| 10                          | Omega     | 50         | +10      | 39/31/19   | 200    | 6          | +30 / +27        | 24–60 (avg 40) |\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Treat design table value descriptions:\n\nRemember, these numbers are guidelines, based on the expected progression of the average Hero. Feel free to tweak these numbers to fit your party.\n\n**To Hit – Single Target/Area of Effect:** This is your threat's attack bonus; there are two values, one for the threat's single target attack and the other for any area of effect attacks.\n\n**Defenses - Primary/Secondary/Trinary:** This refers to your threat's defenses before the application of a role. Arrange the defenses in a way, or lower any defense, as to best fit the narrative. Don't min-max, unless your players are…\n\n**Saves - Primary/Secondary/Rest:** These are the saving throw bonuses for your threat, a primary save, a secondary save, and a flat bonus for all remaining ability scores. Again, assigning these values to fit your threat's narrative feel, a speedster would have dexterity as a primary attribute, while a telepath would have wisdom or charisma, for example.\n\n**Stamina/Wounds:** The Stamina and Wounds for your threat are balanced to allow threats over Zeta to survive 2-3 hits for average damage by a hero of the same rank.\n\n**Damage (Average):** This is the damage range and average damage for single-target attacks. For area-of-effect attacks, use the average damage for an attack 1 rank lower.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>  \n**\\<h3\\> Advanced Treat Design: Threat Parameters**   \nWhile a little more advanced, you can pick and choose rank bonuses, defenses, durability, and attack values from different Ranks in *Table X-X: Threat Parameters* and average them to estimate the threat's effective Rank. Be careful! Combined with Roles and Traits, you may create a challenge you *think* your heroes can handle, only to discover they're in over their heads. Always be ready to adjust on the fly.  \n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Treat Roles:\n\n| Table X-X: Threat Roles |                                                        |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Type                    | **Adjustments**                                        |\n| **Skillful**            | Additional Skill Set, 1 feat, +1 Willpower             |\n| **Striker**             | +10 Stamina, +1 Hit                                    |\n| **Bruiser**             | ×2 Stamina, -1 Avoidance, -1 Willpower                 |\n| **Ranged**              | +1 Hit with ranged attacks, +1 Avoidance               |\n| **Controller**          | +1 to hit with powers, -1 Avoidance, +2 Discipline     |\n| **Lurker**              | +1 Hit, +1 Avoidance, Edge (Sealthy)                   |\n| **Horde Leader**        | +2 Charisma Saves, Buffs' minions, Leadership Manuvers |\n\n-   **Striker:** Relies on speed, precision, and aggression at close range. They're fast, dangerous, and take a hit.\n-   **Bruiser:** Heavy hitter and damage sponge. Suggested Traits: Slam Attack, Knockback, Intimidating Presence.\n-   **Ranged:** Keeps distance, harasses from afar. Suggested Traits: Sniper, Suppressive Fire, Mobility.\n-   **Controller:** Disrupts the heroes' plans. Suggested Traits: Area Denial, Mind Games, Entangling Attack.\n-   **Lurker:** Stealthy and opportunistic. Suggested Traits: Ambush, Shadow Step, Poisoned Blade.\n-   **Horde Leader:** Inspires and directs minions. Suggested Traits: Command Z Horde, Rally Cry, Buff Aura.\n\n    **Solo Boss:** The centerpiece of the story, the type of threat that can take on an entire superhero team and hold its ground.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Treat Sizes\n\nThreats come in all shapes and sizes; choose the most appropriate size for the threat you envision.\n\n| **Table X-X: Threat Size** |               |             |         |           |                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------|---------------|-------------|---------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Size**                   | **Avodance**  | **Wounds**  | **DR**  | **Reach** | **Notes**                                                                             |\n| **Tiny/Smaller**           | —             | —           | —       | —         | Ignores cramped, can share Areas with other creatures, average damage reduced by half |\n| **Small**                  | —             | —           | —       | —         | Maneuverable, no penalties                                                            |\n| **Medium**                 | —             | —           | —       | —         | Default                                                                               |\n| **Large**                  | -1            | +1          | —       | 1 Area    | May impose *Cramped*                                                                  |\n| **Huge**                   | -2            | +2          | +1      | 2 Areas   | Occupies multiple Areas, may impose *Cramped*                                         |\n| **Gargantuan**             | -4            | +3          | +3      | 3+ Areas  | Set-piece scale; controls battlefield                                                 |\n\nRefer to chapter 4, page XX, for descriptions and rules regarding creature size.\n\n-   **Wounds:** creatures of large size and bigger gain bonus wounds; they are just tougher to bring down.\n-   **DR:** Larger creatures have thicker skin; as such, they gain a base DR bonus against all damage with the exception of psychic damage, which is added to any DR they may already possess.\n-   **Reach:** the number of areas a treat can reach due to its size.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Treat Types:\n\nEvery threat also has a **Type,** representing its nature and origin. Types help guide narrative decisions and add small adjustments to make each feel distinct. Types are separate from Roles and can be combined freely.\n\n-   **Origin:** A powered being, such as a mutant, demigod, mystic, or tech-enhanced individual, some of the heroes are villains, while others are just out for them selves.\n-   **Abomination:** The result of the Z-virus infecting someone with a recessive ultra-gene, or horrific experimentation gone wrong. Most abominations are grotesque and terrifying, with unstable biology.\n-   **Animal:** Natural or trained creatures, a trusty dog or horse, or wild creatures such as wolves, big cats, bears, birds, and snakes. Animals have learned to avoid the walking dead and have flourished in a new world with so few humans.\n-   **Construct:** Mechanical or artificial threats, such as drones, security bots, or animated machinery, are durable and unfeeling, though rare; when encountered, they can present a considerable threat.\n-   **Survivor:** fellow humans who endure through grit, training, and desperation; some may be raiders, cultists, snipers, or scavengers.\n-   **Zombies:** This is not limited to the classic mindless brain-eating variety, but also includes \"strange\" zombies that have developed unusual abilities or are just a little more clever than they have any right to be.\n-   **Super-Zombie:** The ones to be truly scared of, super zombies are superhumans and demigods who have succumbed to the Z-virus; these creatures retain all their memories and powers, but have lost all moral guardrails. Thankfully for the survivors, these creatures are very territorial and rarely venture out….. rarely.\n\n| **Table X-X Treat Types** |                                                                                |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Type                      | Adjustment & Notes                                                             |\n| Origin                    | No adjustment — use base stats, may keep a Power Possessed list for reference. |\n| Abomination               | +1 Wound, -1 Avoidance, immune to the frightened condition.                    |\n| Animal                    | +1 Avoidance, -2 Discipline, Intelligence 3 or lower.                          |\n| Construct                 | +10 Stamina, immune to mind-affecting powers.                                  |\n| Survivor                  | No adjustment                                                                  |\n| Undead                    | Uses Zombie Template.                                                          |\n| Super-Zombie              | Uses Super-Zombie Template.                                                    |\n\n### \\<h3\\>Designing Traits\n\n**Converting Powers into Traits**\n\nWhen designing threats, you're encouraged to take inspiration from powers in the game and convert them into simple, narrative-friendly Traits. Traits don't need full mechanical write-ups; they're shorthand abilities. If you want a threat to have the leaping power, you give them a Leaping Pace. Do you want a threat to have Energy Blast: Electrical? give them an Electric Energy Blast: Electrical as an attack. Regeneration? Give your threat a trait where it regenerates 5 stamina at the end of every turn.\n\nHowever, whenever you base a Trait on a power, note the power it's inspired by and assign it a default Rank, typically equal to the threat's Rank. (for Mimic and power checks).\n\nYou can adjust the default Rank up or down if the ability is unusually strong or weak for the threat. Keeping the Rank consistent ensures that abilities feel balanced and that heroes interacting with those powers (via Mimic, Counter, etc.) have a clear mechanical anchor.\n\nTraits remain narrative-first; they're there to create memorable moments without bogging down the game, but this small bookkeeping step keeps them fully integrated into the system when needed.\n\n**Creating Non-Power Traits & Ability Scores**\n\nNot all Traits need to be derived from powers; threats can have Traits inspired by animals, human training, or environmental advantages. Examples: Pack Tactics (gains Advantage if adjacent to ally), Keen Senses (Advantage wisdom-based Challenges to Observe), or Adrenaline Surge (acts at initiative count 20 once per scene). You can also adapt player Maneuvers and Feats into Traits. Note: threats do not themselves take feats; instead, they express these as part of their Traits.\n\n**Save DCs**\n\nSome Traits require heroes to make saving throws. To calculate a Trait's Save DC, use:\n\n*8 + Threat’s Rank Bonus + relevant ability modifier = DC*\n\nFor example, a Strength-based grapple from an Epsilon threat (STR 20 (+5) + Rank Bonus +2), would set a DC of 15.\n\nAs a quick shortcut, you can also refer to the following table of typical Trait DCs by Rank:\n\n| **Table X-X Trait Save DCs** |                           |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Rank**                     | **Typical Trait Save DC** |\n| Zeta                         | 12                        |\n| Epsilon                      | 14                        |\n| Delta                        | 15                        |\n| Gamma                        | 16                        |\n| Beta                         | 17                        |\n| Alpha                        | 18                        |\n| Theta+                       | 19–20                     |\n\nYou are encouraged to adjust DCs slightly if a Trait is unusually potent or weak for its Rank, trust your judgment.\n\n**Recharge**\n\nSome Traits represent powerful abilities that can shift the entire flow of a battle, area attacks, or debilitating conditions like *Stunned* or *Frightened*. To keep these traits from becoming too overwhelming, assign them a **Recharge mechanic** rather than allowing them every turn.\n\nWhen should you apply a Recharge value to a trait? Basically, any trait that targets multiple heroes (Area of Effect), imposes strong conditions (Stun, Prone, Restrained, Fear), or bypasses normal defenses or forces multiple saves.\n\n*Recharge checks are triggered at the start of every turn or when the target suffers a wound; roll a single 1d6 and compare the result to all traits which have been used and are waiting to be recharged.*\n\n-   *Strong single-target conditions (like Stun) should have a* Recharge of **5-6**\n-   *Area of Effect damage or moderate debuffs:* Recharge **4-6**\n-   *Massive tide-turning effects:* Recharge **6**\n\n**Iconic Traits**   \nSome traits are so devastating, so cinematic, that they should be limited to **once per scene**. These are the kind of moments that would deserve a *two-page splash panel* in a comic; they should feel iconic and dramatic.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>  \n**\\<h3\\> Standard Trait Format**\n\n**Trait Name**  \n*Flavor line / narrative hook*  \nAction Type Required (if any)\n\nEffect: Mechanical effect in plain language, target(s), and resolution.\n\nAttack traits include:\n\n-   Attack bonus\n-   Defense targeted (Avoidance, Fortitude, or Discipline)\n-   Range or area of effect and number of targets\n-   Damage (dice + static), Damage type (Ballistic, Slashing, Sonic, etc.)\n-   Any ongoing or triggered conditions with Save DC\n-   Any recharge mechanic, if applicable, or how many uses per scene.\n\nOther traits should follow:\n\n-   Range or area of effect with the number of targets\n-   Any ongoing or triggered conditions with save DC\n-   Any recharge mechanic, if applicable, or how many uses per scene.\n\n#### Attack Trait Examples\n\nBelow are two attack trait examples: Seismic Slam is an expression of *Enhanced Ability Score (Strength),* Sonic Wave is an expression of *Energy Attack (Sonic),* and Psychic Crush is envisioned as a power stunt for *Psychic Attack.*\n\n**Seismic Slam**   \n*\"The ground shook under his fists, and we all went flying.\"*\n\nAction  \n**Effect:** This creature slams the ground, affecting its area and all adjacent areas. Each enemy in the affected Areas must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Half damage on a success. Recharge: 5–6.  \n  \n**Sonic Wave**  \n*\"A focused beam of pure sound slammed into me like a truck.\"*\n\nAction  \n**Effect:** +9 vs Avoidance, 10 area range, 1 target, deals 4d6+2 Sonic damage.\n\n**Psychic Crush**  \n*\"It felt like my skull was going to split open.\"*\n\nAction  \n**Effect:** As an Action, the creature targets one Hero within 2 Areas. The Hero must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn. Recharge: 5–6.\n\n#### Narrative Trait Examples\n\nThese are some traits that represent creature behavior or unique abilities. Use these to create a narrative for your threat and reinforce its behavior through the mechanics. *Unshaken Resolve* and *The Mask Never Cracks* below could be a good expression of the *Invulnerability* power.\n\n**Horde Mentality**  \n*\"There were so many of them, so many.\"*  \n**Effect:** Gains +1 Attack bonus for each allied zombie in the same Area, up to +3.\n\n**Minions are expendable**   \n*\"I don't understand how they follow that madman.\"*  \nReaction\n\n**Effect:** When this threat is targeted by an attack they are aware of, they may redirect the attack to an allied creature of lower Rank within the same area. The ally takes the full effect of the attack instead.\n\n**Not Without My Horde**\n\n*\"Their devotion gives him strength, even as it drains theirs.\"*  \n**Effect:** This threat gains Advantage on all attacks and saving throws while at least one allied minion is present in the same Area. If no allies remain, the threat suffers Disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of the scene.\n\n**Unshaken Resolve**\n\n*\"You could see it in his eyes - nothing we did was going to stop him.\"*  \n**Effect:** The first time this threat would be Stunned, Prone, or otherwise lose its next turn, it ignores the effect entirely. This can occur once per scene.\n\n**The Mask Never Cracks**\n\n*\"Even as we tore him apart, he never let us see the pain.\"*  \n**Effect:** The threat never visibly shows harm or distress, regardless of the number of wounds it has suffered. This threat is immune to the *Wounded* condition. Additionally, when below half Wounds, the threat gains Advantage on challenges to intimidate or otherwise unnerve oppoents.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n### \\<h3\\>Default power score guidelines\n\nWhen designing powered threats in *Rotted Capes,* you don't necessarily use the powers, but use them more as a guideline when creating traits as mentioned above, but to properly interact with some powers, you should list the powers and their power scores on your threat's statblock.   \n  \nNot only does this provide you with everything you need to roll power checks and have the necessary information for players with powers such as nullify and mimic. However, it provides you with additional tools when running encounters. You should lean into a threat's traits, but sometimes a threat may want to try something a little out of the box with their powers.\n\nHere is a **quick guideline** when assigning power scores:\n\n-   **One primary power can approach the Rank Cap.**\n-   Each additional power is typically **3 to 5 points lower** than the previous one.\n\nThe more powers a threat has, the less individually potent each power becomes.  \n  \nRemember, threats can also possess power stunts; they may emulate powers or power tricks, both of which should be represented as traits. Just keep in mind that emulated powers have a power score of -6, that of their parents' score, which should be represented in the trait's capabilities (dealing damage as a power one rank lower, for example).\n\n| **Table X-X Treat Power Score Guidelines**  |              |              |              |

**\\<h4\\>Advanced Threat Design: Point Pools & Granular Control**\n\nIf you prefer more granular control, you can build advanced threats using a *Power Point Pool by Rank.*\n\nJust assign the threat a pool of points equal to: Rank Cap × Number of Powers ÷ 1.5 (rounded down).\n\nDistribute these points among their powers as you see fit, respecting individual power caps, of course.\n\nFor example:\n\nDelta Rank (Rank Cap 30),\n\n2 Powers: 30 × 2 ÷ 1.5 = 40 points total.\n\nAllocate: Power 1 = 26, Power 2 = 14.\n\nOr, for 4 powers:\n\nDelta Rank (Rank Cap 30),\n\n4 Powers: 30 × 4 ÷ 1.5 = 80 points.\n\nAllocate: 20 / 18 / 16 / 16.\n\nThis approach offers full flexibility and helps balance unusual or highly customized threats.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n| Name                | Type:  |

If they have not fed in a few months, they will slip into a semi-active state, remaining still like corpses for weeks on end. During this time, zombies decompose at a much slower rate and will \"wake up\" when they hear any loud noise within 10 areas or smell a living creature within 3 Areas.\n\n**Enhanced Zombie Senses:** +5 bonus to all challenges when attempting to perceive living creatures through sight, smell, or sound. Additionally, they can see in natural darkness.\n\n**The Speed of the Dammed: A** Zombie that has fed on fresh meat over the last week has its walking pace increased by 3\n\n**Relentless Nature:** Zombies attack the living with little regard for their safety. If they do not use actions to end the *engulfed* condition.\n\n#### \\<h3\\> Common Traits\n\nThese are a collection of common threat traits\n\n**Ambusher**\n\n*I swear to you, it came out of nowhere, that… thing. Cut down Steve before he knew what hit him, honesty a better way to go truth be told.*\n\n**Effect:** In the first round of a combat, a *creature with this feature* has Advantage on attack rolls against any creature it surprised\n\n**Aggressive**\n\n*I'm telling you, it just tossed a car to the side as it came at us; I had no idea something that big could move that fast,*\n\n**Effect:** As a bonus action once per scene, a creature with this trait can move an additional 2 areas as long as it is moving toward a hostile creature. If the creature has a high strength score to move an object in its path, it may do so as part of its movement.\n\n**Cannibalistic Zombie**\n\n*Dude, I know what I saw! I saw that 10-foot THING grab a zombie and take its head right off with a single bite! It was eating Z's man, Z's! Umm… ok… I think I'm going to throw up again.*\n\n**Requirement:** Zombie or Abomination\n\n**Effect:** Some very rare zombies have been seen eating other zombies. This could be due to a lack of food or a mutation of the Z-virus; regardless, zombies with this Advantage can trigger both *Speed of the Dammed* by eating other zombies. Some abominations have also been seen eating zombies, in which case they gain 20 temporary stamina for 1 hour after eating a zombie.\n\n**Claws of the Dammed**\n\n*They took him down! They pulled Titan to the ground, I tell you! I saw it with my own eyes.*\n\n**Requirement:** Zombie\n\n**Effect:** Anytime a zombie succeeds in a Grab attempt, it also deals its melee attack damage, which can result in infection.\n\n**Cunning Zombie**\n\n*The look in its eyes, I'm telling you, that Zombie in the blue shirt was not like the rest of them. It always stayed behind the others, almost using them as cover! I was lucky to escape alive.*\n\n**Requirement:** Zombie\n\n**Effect:** Unlike other zombies, Cunning Zombies do not have their mental abilities reduced. Also, unlike other zombies, it will seek to preserve itself and even overcome the automatic feeding desire that comes with the Consumption of the Flesh. They will take the time to put out fires and attempt to escape to preserve their undead existence. Set the Zombie's intelligence, wisdom, and charisma to 10.\n\n**Enhanced Strength  \n***\"If you throw another semi-truck at me, I'm going to lose it\" – Arch Lighting.*  **  \nRequirement:** 20+ Str  \n**Effect:** Ceature's strength score is doubled to determine how much they can lift, carry, or drag. The creature also has Advantage on strength checks and strength saving throws.\n\n**Grappler**\n\n*They literally pulled Titan Down; I'm telling you, they literally pulled him down.*\n\n**Effect:** Upon a successful melee attack, the creature with this trait may attempt the grab combat maneuver as a bonus action. Once they have a creature grappled, they gain a +2 bonus on all grappling combat maneuvers.\n\n**Home Field Advantage**\n\n*Always choose where the battle takes place; when you don't, you become the prey, not the hunter.*\n\n**Effect:** When a creature with this trait fights in its lair or territory (a city block or so), it gains a +1 bonus to all its defenses and a +1 bonus to hit.\n\n**  \nInnocent Appearance**\n\n*I saw that Zombie again, the one in the blue shirt. It waved to me, almost like it was calling me over! We need to take that thing out; if I didn't know better, I could have sworn it was a breather.*\n\n**Requirement:** Cunning Zombie\n\n**Effect:** By using a combination of shadows and a slightly more \"life-like\" skin, the zombie appears human from even a close distance. Oppoents suffer Disadvantage on all Wisdom and Intelligence challenges to recognize the zombie's true nature.\n\nCommonly referred to as \"*Damsels*,\" these zombies sometimes mimic frightened Bystanders in the hope of drawing a Survivor close. Unlike other zombie types, damsels don't travel in groups, preferring to surround themselves with other zombie types, which they will use to their Advantage.\n\n**Mimicry**\n\n*It was calling out for help, but there was just something about that voice that threw me off. Thank God, I know how many others feel for it.*\n\n**Effect:** *Creatures* with this trait can mimic simple sounds they have heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. Oppoents must succeed in DC: 15 (Wisdom or Intelligence) challenge to recognize the sound is just \"off\".\n\n**Virulent Infection**\n\n*I'm telling you he turned within an hour, not days. hours… I saw it happen!!!*\n\n**Requirement:** Zombie\n\n**Effect:** Zombies with this trait have a super changed version of the Z virus (see pg XX), increasing the attack bonus to +12, Resistance DC to 30, and the infection track gets spent up to 30min, 1hr, 2hr, and 3hr respectively.\n\n**Wolf Pack Tactics**\n\n*The way Z's bring down pray reminds me of a pack of wolves, but not as… strategic. Maybe more like ants swarming a body? I don't know, but it's creepy as hell.*\n\n**Effect:** Creatures with this trait gain Advantage on an attack roll against a target if at least one of the creatures' allies is in the same area as the target and the ally isn't incapacitated.\n","size_bytes":104439},"docs/5.2_Building and Running the Enclave 2.2.md":{"content":"# **\\<h1\\> Building and running your Heroes’ Enclave & Hotel**\n\n*Safety, community, and a glimmer of hope.*\n\nNow that your players have finished building their heroes and you’re ready to tell a good story, let’s talk about where and who they call home.\n\nHere, you build your player's enclave and its current sanctuary amidst the chaos of the world of *Rotted Capes*. Survivors understand the importance of a strong and resilient enclave; they are a family, relying upon each other to see the next sunrise. At the same time, your Survivor’s hotel serves as a fort against the hordes of undead, gangs of scavengers, and raiders.\n\nAs discussed earlier in Book IV enclaves (pg. XX), the enclave refers to the group of survivors, while your hotel is the current base of operations. Hotels may come and go, but it’s your fellow survivors that you lean on and protect when the zombies' brains hit the woodchipper.\n\n## \\<h2\\> Core Concepts\n\nHeroes don’t just fight zombies; they protect something bigger: the people and places that remain. Every Enclave has three narrative Characteristics and individual **Facilities** that the heroes can improve over time.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Enclave & Hotel Characteristics\n\n-   **Cohesion** (moral, unity): Cohesion reflects the collective unity, trust, and emotional resilience of the enclave’s members. It measures how well the survivors work together under pressure, resolve disputes, and maintain hope in the face of the apocalypse. High Cohesion allows the community to act as one, supporting heroes in crises and reducing infighting. As survivors lose faith or factions emerge, Cohesion falters, making cooperation harder and risking fragmentation.\n-   **Resources** (food, supplies, energy): Resources represent the enclave’s material abundance and stability, including food, water, power, and critical supplies. A strong Resources rating means the enclave can endure shortages, keep its Facilities operational, and provide heroes with what they need to succeed. As Resources dwindle, the community is forced to ration, Facilities shut down, and desperation sets in, making survival and recovery increasingly difficult.\n-   **Security**: Security measures the enclave’s ability to defend itself against external threats. It encompasses fortifications, surveillance, concealment, and the vigilance of its guards. Strong Security keeps zombies, raiders, and rival factions at bay, buying the heroes time to act. As Security erodes, breaches become more frequent, attacks more dangerous, and fear more pervasive, threatening the enclave’s very existence.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Each Characteristic is rated:\n\n-   **Exceptional:** The enclave excels in this area. Survivors are coordinated, well-supplied, or incredibly vigilant. Heroes benefit from a significant edge, reducing related Challenge DCs by 5.\n-   **Strong:** The enclave is thriving in this aspect. Survivors are confident, systems are reliable, and threats feel manageable. Heroes reduce related Challenge DCs by 2.\n-   **Steady:** The enclave is holding steady. Survivors are managing but face occasional struggles. No modifier to related Challenge DCs.\n-   **Weak:** The enclave is faltering in this aspect. Survivors are strained, mistakes happen, and cracks show. Related Challenge DCs increase by 2.\n-   **Critical:** The enclave is on the brink in this area. Survivors are desperate, systems have collapsed, and danger looms large. Related Challenge DCs increase by 5.\n\nThese are tracked privately by the Editor and expressed narratively.\n\n### \\<H3\\>Utilizing Characteristics in Play\n\nEach Characteristic and each Facility can contribute directly to challenges and dramatic moments. Here are examples of how to integrate them:\n\n-   **Security**: During missions or when defending against attacks, reduce the Challenge DC of relevant defensive Challenges by the Hotel’s Security level.\n-   **Cohesion**: When resisting fear, despair, or internal strife, heroes gain Advantage or reduced DCs on Challenges equal to Cohesion.\n-   **Resources**: When supply shortages, energy issues, or crafting come into play, reduce relevant Challenge DCs by Resources if Strong, or increase if Fragile\n-   **Facilities**: Facilities grant narrative permission and reduce relevant Challenge DCs based on their current Characteristics (Strong or Exceptional). Energized Facilities provide full benefits, while unpowered (ones that are weak or critical) still grant narrative permission, but at a cost. Additionally, Facilities enable unique actions: the Radio Room can contact distant enclaves; the Tactical Room grants planning bonuses; the Medical Bay improves healing and disease resistance.\n\n**For example,** A hero repairing a SWAT transport would need a facility even to get it working. A strong or exceptional Auto Shop would reduce the Challenge DC by the Facility’s Characteristics when rolling to repair the truck.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Utilizing Enclave Characteristics and Facilities\n\nBonuses from Enclave Characteristics and Facilities should only apply when the heroes are within the Hotel or directly connected to it through a Facility like the Radio Room or Tactical Room. Benefits outside the Enclave should be rare and always framed as the result of a specific Facility enabling remote support.\n\nEncourage players to invest in their Facilities, reward those who take the initiative, and actively include them in their story and facility. This approach also encourages creative use of Skill Sets, highlighting how some things can only be achieved with a functioning facility.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Facilities\n\nFacilities are places within a hotel in which heroes can fully utilize their skill sets in a safe, secure area. Facilities have a rank enclave, just like enclave characteristics.\n\nHeroes can build, repair, and upgrade Facilities over time through missions or downtime. Example Facilities include:\n\n-   **Medical Bay:** Improves recovery times, allows heroes to treat diseases and wounds more effectively, and reduces the DCs of medical Challenges and saving throws to recover wounds.\n-   **Security Hub:** Provides surveillance and advanced defenses; grants Advantage or lower DCs on detecting intrusions or defending against attacks.\n-   **Short-Wave Radio Room:** Enables long-range communication with other enclaves or independent survivors, allowing communication between the heroes and the enclave while opening new story hooks and alliances.\n-   **Tactical Room:** Filled with maps of the city, old satellite photos, it’s a place where heroes can plan future operations. If the heroes meet and plan in a tactical room, they gain one communal plot point they can spend during the issue. Keep in mind that smart players might use their plot points to alter a scene before they even arrive on site, “hey guys, I used to have a safe house nearby, maybe we can use that as a staging point and get a nights rest before we head into the complex”\n-   **Maker’s Workshop:** Supports crafting, repairs, and jury-rigging equipment; reduces DCs for engineering or crafting Challenges.\n-   **Training Room:** Allows heroes and bystanders to train; over time, can improve the capabilities of the supporting cast or unlock maneuvers.\n-   **Facilities have three characteristics:** Inactive, Functional, and Advanced. Improving their characteristics enhances their benefits and reliability.\n\n#### \\<h4\\> Developing Facilities\n\nCreating or upgrading a Facility is more than just something that happens in between issues; it becomes part of the story, a sub-plot that plays out over the course of a few issues, representing the challenge of building effective facilities in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nWhen a player decides to establish a Facility, they create a **shopping list** of the materials and actions needed to build it. The Editor then creates a list, called a **blueprint**, which might incorporate some or all of the player's **shopping list** as well as a few requirements of their own. This reflects how you don’t always know what you need till you need it. The **Blueprint** is kept secret at first, then later revealed to the player after the first few successful challenges.\n\nCompleting a Facility commonly requires 10 tasks, which brings it online at the rank of **Steady**. Improving it to Strong requires 15 Blueprint tasks, and getting it to Exceptional takes another 20. Heroes need the right Skill Sets to contribute meaningfully, and multiple players can work together to get a facility up and running.\n\n### \\<h4\\>Managing Big Dreams: Adjudicating Enclave Builds\n\nIt’s inevitable. Once they get their facilities online, at some point, your players are going to look around their enclave and say, “Hey, you know what we really need here? A teleport pad.” Or some other off-the-wall idea. And when that happens, your job is not to laugh them out of the room; your job is to turn that wild idea into a story worth telling.\n\nBuilding new gear, gadgets, or facilities in the enclave should feel big, earned, and memorable. But it also needs to be balanced, cinematic, and, above all, fun to play out.\n\nFirst, encourage your players to come up with a *Shopping List*. This is their brainstormed wish list of parts, tools, and ideas. Don’t worry if it doesn’t make much sense. In fact, don’t let them get bogged down trying to make it realistic; half the fun is seeing what they come up with. Once they’ve handed it over, you turn it into a *Blueprint*.\n\nThe Blueprint is *your* version of the plan. It’s the actual list of requirements, skill challenges, and complications they’ll face. Flesh it out with what’s missing, scale it to their current resources, and, importantly, add a few complications.\n\nEvery big build should have a chance to go wrong. Maybe the power source is unstable. Maybe the noise attracts unwanted attention. Maybe one of the key parts they need is sitting at the heart of a super-zombie nest. You don’t need to sabotage them, but you do need to make it interesting.\n\nFrom there, you set the Difficulty. Standard gear? That’s low DC, no fuss, done in a single interlude. But anything that replicates a power, teleportation, force fields, or weather control, should climb the DC ladder fast. Make them work for it. Consider breaking especially ambitious builds into phases, each with its own challenge and potential setback. Sometimes you’ll want to let the build stretch across an entire Issue or more. That’s fine. That’s the making of a damn good story.\n\nWhen deciding how hard to make it, lean on the same principles you’d use for Restricted Challenges and Skill Set Challenges. Big builds are the perfect opportunity to reward creative uses of Skill Sets, Edges, and Deep Cut Moments. If someone’s niche expertise finally shines through, make it matter! If nobody at the table has the right Skill Set, that’s a chance to bring in a supporting cast member, or for the players to go on a side mission to recruit someone who can help.\n\nAnd don’t forget to scale the payoff. Builds that mimic powers should always come with limitations. They might be fragile, fixed in place, prone to burnout, have a long recharge time, prone to malfunctions at the most inopportune times, and it's simply too big to bring along in the field. That’s part of the point, their enclave assets, not just extra powers strapped to a character sheet.\n\nAt the end of the day, your role here is to say “yes, but.” Yes, they can build it. But it’ll take time, risk, and a little bit of luck to make it work. When they finally get the thing online, when the lights flicker, the panels hum, and the teleport pad actually works, that’s your chance to let them feel like heroes who built something that matters. That’s the payoff they’ll remember.\n\nSo let them dream big. But make them EARN it.  \n  \n\\<Side Bar\\>  \n**\\<h4\\> Developing new Tech or Magtec-based Powers  \n**If you have a player who wants to start working on some new gear that emulates a power for themselves or someone else in the party, have them follow the same path as for building an enclave build. Have the players develop a shopping list from which you build out the final blueprint. Once the item is done, the hero for whom the item is being made takes the *Acquire New Power* feat. Note that a player can “pre-take” this feat at a lower level and “activate it” once they acquire the new power. Don’t hand-wave away this moment! Lean into it and use it to tell a story of everything the heroes had to go through to build it, make it matter.   \n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<h1\\>Home Sweet Home (Building an Enclave)**\n\nBuilding an enclave happens in three steps: you choose its style of governance, set its starting characteristics, and finally flesh out some of its survivors. This foundation determines not just how the enclave operates, but the kind of drama and challenges it may face.\n\n### **\\<h3\\>**Enclave’s Characteristics\n\nEvery Enclave begins with three key characteristics: **Cohesion, Resources, and Security.** These don’t have numbers; they are set on the narrative five-rank scale below. Each attribute starts at **Steady** by default, but players can choose to weaken one to strengthen another, reflecting the kind of story they want to tell.  \n  \nThis keeps the focus on the fiction, and not on random rolls. These ranks can rise or fall throughout play as heroes succeed or fail, and as the Editor weaves events into the story.\n\n### **\\<h3\\>Determine the Hotel’s Governance**\n\nEvery community needs leadership, even if it’s chaotic. Players can work with you to choose a style of governance, which helps define the enclave’s culture and narrative strengths and weaknesses.\n\n-   **Consensus:** Everyone has a say, but it’s slow and indecisive. Tends to strengthen Cohesion but leave Security Fragile.\n-   **Representative:** Elected leaders keep order without too much tension. Solid Cohesion.\n-   **Anarchy:** Nobody’s in charge, which is oddly liberating for some. Cohesion suffers.\n-   **Theocratic:** Guided by faith and ritual. High Morale, but rigid.\n-   **Military:** Disciplined and focused on defense. Security is strong, but morale may be low.\n-   **Authoritarian:** Control is absolute, Security is high, but resentment festers.\n-   **Hybrid:** A mix of any two styles above.\n\nInvolve your players from the start. Let them imagine the enclave’s flavor, describe bystanders, name the Hotel, and decide its vibe. You keep the actual ranks behind the curtain, they’ll feel the narrative consequences without ever seeing numbers.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Create some bystanders.**\n\nAn Enclave is more than its leaders and heroes; it’s the people who live there. Each player should come up with one or two bystanders: ordinary survivors with names, quirks, and small roles to play. They’re not fully-fledged crew members, but they give the enclave depth and color, and offer you hooks to pull on during play.\n\n## **\\<H2\\>** Describing the Hotel\n\nDetermine your hotel’s location; this is entirely in the hands of the players, as numerous options would be daunting to list.\n\n**Other Wilderness Hotel Examples:**\n\n*The Treehouse Sanctuary:* A network of interconnected treehouses hidden within a dense forest.\n\n*The Cave Stronghold:* A massive cave system fortified with traps and defenses.\n\n*The Mountain Watchtower:* A high-altitude outpost situated on a mountaintop, where your heroes keep a vigilant eye on the surrounding wilderness and coordinate rescue operations.\n\n*The River Outpost:* A fortified outpost located along a major river, providing a strategic location for heroes to intercept infected creatures and provide aid to river-traveling survivors.\n\n*The Cliffside Refuge:* A hidden hotel built into the cliffs, offering stunning views of the wilderness.\n\n*The Oasis:* A hidden oasis in the middle of a vast desert where survivors gather to replenish supplies, rest, and exchange vital information.\n\n*The Swamp Sanctuary:* A network of elevated platforms and huts built within a treacherous swamp.\n\n**Other ideas for urban Hotels:**\n\n*The Rooftop Refuge:* A network of interconnected rooftops accessed through hidden passageways, where heroes watch over the city and coordinate their efforts against the infected.\n\n*The Subway Sanctuary:* A defunct subway station converted into an underground sanctuary, providing shelter, supplies, and transportation for survivors.\n\n*The Mall Stronghold:* is a fortified shopping mall transformed into a self-sustaining hotel where survivors from other hotels gather and trade.\n\n*The Bridge Bastion:* A heavily fortified bridge spanning across a river turned into a stronghold.\n\n*The Theater Haven:* A grand theater repurposed as a sanctuary founded by a group of artists.\n\n*The Corporate Tower:* A high-rise office building transformed into a hub of a scientific research facility by what’s left of a mega-corp. They work to find a cure and develop new abilities to combat the infection.\n\n**Other Hotel Examples**\n\n*The Heroic Hall:* A run-down colossal mansion with buggy state-of-the-art technology, secret passages, and a somewhat dependable high-tech training facility.\n\n*The Villain's Lair:* A hidden underground fortress, complete with elaborate traps, high-security systems, and an arsenal of advanced weaponry, once a secret base for a supervillain and their loyal henchmen, is long dead, or Z’d.\n\n*Paradise:* An island just off the coast of a major city, just safe enough, well, until you remember zombies can walk along the ocean bottom.\n\n## *\\<h2\\>*Example Hotels and *their* enclaves.\n\n### *\\<h3\\> The Citadel, Paradigm City*\n\nThe Citadel is a fortified skyscraper located at the heart of the city, towering over the urban ruins. Once a bustling office building, it has been transformed into a haven for survivors and a base of operations for urban superheroes. The upper floors serve as living quarters and communal spaces, while the lower levels are fortified with advanced security systems, creating a nearly impenetrable stronghold. The Citadel stands as a symbol of defiance against the chaos of Z-Day, its walls adorned with makeshift art and inspirational messages from its residents.\n\nThe enclave within the Citadel is led by Sergeant Robert \"Dropshot\" Billiards, a decorated marine sniper who found himself in the city when Z-Day struck. Under his leadership, the enclave operates with military-style governance, ensuring order and discipline in these tumultuous times. Sergeant Billiards has conscripted not only survivors, but also several aimless sidekicks who lost their sponsor heroes during the outbreak.\n\nWhile safe, the enclave has begun to crack under the weight of Sergeant Robert “Dropshot” Billiards’ iron grip. His obsession with maintaining order has devolved into paranoia: random inspections, harsh punishments for “cowardice,” and a culture of fear.\n\nThe rescued sidekicks, once hopeful, are now forced into dangerous scavenging runs without proper support. Billiards justifies this as “hardening them for the war to come,” but whispers circulate that he’s sending dissenters into no-return missions on purpose.\n\nThe Citadel remains the safest stronghold in the city… but more than a few residents dream of escaping it.\n\n| **The Citadel, Paradigm City** | **Facilities:** |                   |             |                   |         |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|---------|\n| **Governance:**                | **Military**    | **Medical Bay**   | Strong      | **Tactical Room** | Strong  |\n|                                |                 | **Training Bay**  | Exceptional |                   |         |\n| **Cohesion:**                  | **Stady**       | **Gunsmith Shop** | Exceptional |                   |         |\n| **Resources**:                 | Strong          | **Carpentry**     | **Weak**    |                   |         |\n| **Security**:                  | Exceptional     | **Auto Garage**   | **Steady**  |                   |         |\n\n### *\\<h3\\> The Underground Bunker:*\n\nThe Underground Bunker is a hidden network of tunnels sprawling beneath the city, offering a concealed refuge for survivors. Originally constructed as a part of the city's old subway system, it has been repurposed into a secure enclave. Today, the claustrophobic tunnels of the Underground Bunker are equal parts refuge and trap. The advanced systems that keep it running also keep its survivors shackled: lights flicker unpredictably, doors jam at the worst times, and life-support malfunctions are common.\n\nDr. Emily “Patch” Parker holds it all together through sheer brilliance and caffeine… but even she has begun to fray. Her once-bright optimism has become brittle, and her obsession with maintaining the bunker’s systems has isolated her from her people. Worse, the bunker’s security systems seem to have developed quirks that she refuses to discuss, sensors that track the wrong people, turrets that fire without warning.\n\nThe community remains close-knit, but some wonder if they’ve traded zombies for a different kind of death trap.\n\n| **The Underground Bunker** | **Facilities:**  |                      |             |   |   |\n|----------------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------|---|---|\n| **Governance**             | Authoritarian    | **Medical Bay**      | **Steady**  |   |   |\n|                            |                  | **Gunsmith Shop**    | **Steady**  |   |   |\n| **Cohesion:**              | Steady           | **Makers Shop**      | **Steady**  |   |   |\n| **Resources**              | Steady           | **Security**         | Exceptional |   |   |\n| **Security**               | Exceptional      | **Short-Wave Radio** | Strong      |   |   |\n\n### *\\<h3\\> The Wilderness Retreat:*\n\nThe Wilderness Retreat is a secluded cabin nestled deep within a dense forest, far removed from the chaos of infected cities. Surrounded by towering trees and accessible only via a hidden trail, this refuge offers a serene haven for survivors and heroes alike. The cabin, built from sturdy timber, blends seamlessly with its natural surroundings, providing solid and yet well-hidden shelter.\n\nThe enclave within the Wilderness Retreat is led by \"Silverhawk,\" an ex-sidekick turned A-lister superhero known for her agility, sharp senses, and unmatched archery skills. Once the protégé of the legendary hero \"Sky Guardian,\" Although Silverhawk is the de facto leader, the enclave operates via a government of consensus, ensuring that every member has a voice in the decisions that affect their community.   \n  \nFrom a distance, the Wilderness Retreat seems idyllic, until you’re close enough to smell the smoke. The forest’s natural resources have begun to dwindle after years of overuse, and tensions run high among the enclave’s residents. Silverhawk’s authority has come under quiet challenge by a growing faction of survivalists who believe the group needs to abandon “consensus” and take a harder stance to secure what little remains.\n\nRumors abound of poachers raiding nearby streams and sabotaging traps, and two residents have already vanished without a trace, likely dragged away by something far worse than wolves. Even Silverhawk herself seems more withdrawn, her patrols growing longer and her temper shorter.\n\nThe Retreat is still a sanctuary, but for how much longer?\n\n| **The Wilderness Retreat** | **Facilities:** |                      |             |   |   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|---|---|\n| **Governance**             | Consensus       | **Medical Bay**      | Exceptional |   |   |\n|                            |                 | **Security Hub**     | Strong      |   |   |\n| **Cohesion:**              | **Weak**        | **Leather working**  | Strong      |   |   |\n| **Resources**              | Steady          | **Makers Shop**      | Steady      |   |   |\n| **Security**               | Strong          | **Short-Wave Radio** | **Weak**    |   |   |\n\n### *\\<h3\\> Hotel Paradise:*\n\nParadise is an island located just off the coast of Miami, offering a deceptive haven in a world overrun by the undead. The island, about two miles offshore, provides a beautiful yet precarious refuge for its inhabitants. While it boasts lush landscapes and a variety of natural resources, the constant threat of zombies walking along the ocean bottom to its shores poses a unique challenge. The survivors have erected numerous fences around the island to trap and slow down these relentless invaders, but the island's large size makes it difficult to defend every inch effectively.\n\nThe enclave on Paradise is led by \"Oceanwalker,\" a former Coast Guard officer turned superhero with the ability to manipulate water. Oceanwalker's powers are instrumental in defending the island, allowing him to create barriers and divert zombie hordes. Among the survivors is a genius in drone technology known as \"Techie\" Tom, who uses his expertise to scout the city from the comfort of the island, deploying drones to monitor zombie movements and gather vital information.\n\nDespite Oceanwalker’s calm facade, the island is fraying at the edges. The relentless undead keep finding new ways to breach the perimeter, and every storm chips away at their precious resources. The consensus governance is increasingly deadlocked between factions who want to fortify at all costs and those who argue for evacuation before it’s too late. Oceanwalker himself seems torn; recent sightings of him walking the shores alone, whispering to the waves, have unnerved even his closest allies.\n\nTechie Tom’s drones are the only thing keeping them one step ahead of disaster… but even he admits the batteries won’t last much longer, and some of his footage shows things crawling on the ocean floor that no one wants to believe exist.\n\n| **Hotel Paradise** | **Facilities:** |                      |             |               |        |\n|--------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------|--------|\n| **Governance**     | Consensus       | **Medical Bay**      | Exceptional | **Library**   | Weak   |\n|                    |                 | **Security Hub**     | Steady      | **Reliquary** | Steady |\n| **Cohesion:**      | Exceptional     | **Tech Shop**        | Strong      |               |        |\n| **Resources**      | Strong          | **Boat Drydock**     | Steady      |               |        |\n| **Security**       | Stady           | **Short-Wave Radio** | Exceptional |               |        |\n\n### \\<h3\\> The Overpass\n\nPerched precariously on the crumbling remains of a highway overpass, this so-called enclave is little more than a collection of tents, tarps, and gutted cars lashed together with wire and desperation. Below, the roads are choked with wreckage and slow-moving hordes, and the constant moan of the dead serves as a reminder that there’s nowhere else to go.\n\nThe Overpass is less a community and more a prison of circumstance. It’s “run” by Marcus “One-Eye” Vick, a petty gang enforcer before Z-Day who seized control early by knifing his rivals and declaring himself the only one with the balls to lead. His idea of leadership is simple: take what you can, crush dissent, and keep the strongest fed so they can keep everyone else in line.\n\nSupplies here are dangerously low. Water must be hauled up from a distant, barely functional pump, often at the cost of lives. Food is rationed tightly, but nobody can prove who’s hoarding and who’s starving. The wounded are left to die rather than waste precious bandages, and anyone caught sneaking off or plotting escape gets thrown off the side.\n\nEvery day, new faces show up… and just as many disappear. The place reeks of desperation, sweat, and rot. Whispers of cannibalism circulate, but no one dares ask.\n\nEven the zombies seem reluctant to climb up and claim what’s left here. Perhaps even they know the Overpass is already dead.\n\n| **The Overpass** | **Facilities:** |                  |      |   |   |\n|------------------|-----------------|------------------|------|---|---|\n| **Governance**   | Authoritarian   | **Medical Bay**  | Weak |   |   |\n|                  |                 | **Security Hub** | Weak |   |   |\n| **Cohesion:**    | Weak            |                  |      |   |   |\n| **Resources**    | Weak            |                  |      |   |   |\n| **Security**     | Stady           |                  |      |   |   |\n\n# \\<H1\\> Running the Enclave\n\nOnce your enclave is founded, it becomes a living, breathing component of the game. Below, we present two ways to integrate your players' enclave into every issue.\n\nAt the start of each Issue, roll 2d20 on this table to spark a new narrative turn. Each event can be run as a single Challenge, escalated into a Dramatic Sequence, or even expanded into a full Issue, depending on pacing and narrative weight. The Editor sets a base DC, adjusting for relevant attribute ranks:\n\n-   Exceptional: Reduce DC by 5\n-   Strong: Reduce DC by 2\n-   Steady: No change\n-   Weak: Increase DC by 2\n-   Critical: Increase DC by 5\n\nSkill Sets that logically apply should be encouraged.\n\n**Example Event:**\n\n**A Super Z becomes aware of the Hotel.** A player rolls to meet a Challenge (base DC 15) to misdirect or distract the Super Z. An appropriate Skill Set (like Stealth or Combat Strategist) applies, and the DC is reduced if Security is Strong. Each time this event recurs, the base DC increases by 5.

This does not have to feel mechanical or random; it can be integrated into the ongoing story. Perhaps morale falters after a tense loss. Perhaps supplies dwindle in a bad season. Perhaps security weakens as fences rot and guards become complacent. Even without an immediate triggering event, the world’s weight should slowly press in. In this way, the constant need for maintenance, repair, and care becomes part of the narrative.\n\nFacilities can degrade as well if left unchecked. Systems break down, equipment wears out, and what was once a gleaming centerpiece can become a liability if not maintained.\n\n### \\<H3\\> Show, Don’t Tell\n\nDon’t think of characteristics as a set of Characteristics but more like a collection of story prompts that spur subplots. *The enclave’s ranks should be invisible to the players.* They should have no idea how close they might be to a crisis or just how lucky they are.\n\nWhen cohesion starts slipping, show it through whispered arguments, cliques forming, and the occasional shoving match. If resources run thin, let them see the empty shelves, taste the watered-down rations, and watch survivors huddling around dying candles when the lights flicker out. Even security can feel different when it falters, uneasy glances at the shadows beyond the gate, extra footsteps on the watch, and the sound of nails being hastily hammered into weak points. And Facilities? Don’t list their status. Show the sputtering generator, the offline cameras, and the wounded being treated on bare cots instead of in the once-pristine medical bay.\n\nWhen attributes reach Critical, the story itself shifts. Critical Cohesion can erupt into outright civil war, with factions forming and splintering off. Critical Morale sees survivors giving up entirely, walking out into the dead-filled streets rather than facing another day. Critical Resources or Energy can grind the entire operation to a halt, forcing rationing, blackouts, and hard choices about who gets what. Critical Security leaves the Hotel exposed, and enemies, humans and undead alike, will waste no time exploiting it.\n\nFacilities, if left to degrade completely, may cease to function entirely, removing their bonuses and narrative benefits. They may even become liabilities, attract danger, or drain precious resources.\n\nAt its heart, the slow erosion of stability is not just a mechanic; it’s a story engine. It motivates players to take the initiative and gives every choice weight. Don’t tell the players they’ve “lost a rank of Security.” Show them the cracks in the wall, the growing unease, and the bloody handprint on the gate that wasn’t there yesterday. Then let them decide what they’re willing to risk setting things right.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Home Improvement\n\nWhen players take direct action to influence the Enclave or Hotel, tie their choices to Skill Set-driven Challenges. A successful medical intervention might stabilize morale. A clever engineering fix could shore up Security. A well-played negotiation between rival factions might mend fractures in Cohesion. These aren’t just rolls, they’re moments to showcase each hero’s strengths and leave a mark on the story. When a player leans into a particularly thematic Skill Set or embraces a defining aspect of their backstory in the process, take note. Reward those moments with narrative spotlight, memorable consequences, and even unexpected breakthroughs; that’s where the game shines.\n\nA temporary boost to one of the enclave’s characteristics can usually be achieved with a single Enclave Interlude and a successful Challenge. Permanent increases are more arduous, often requiring sustained effort across several sessions and a series of successful Challenges. These upgrades should feel earned, the result of focus, teamwork, and creative choices.\n\nPlayers who ignore the slow decay of their home will see it slide further into decline. Those who rise to meet the challenge, however, will not only restore what’s been lost, they’ll make the enclave stronger than it ever was.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Time and Teamwork\n\nThe heroes’ time is one of their most precious resources. Every Enclave Interlude comes at a cost: what you choose to fix means something else must wait. Temporary gains can usually be secured in one Interlude with a successful Challenge, but permanent improvements demand sustained commitment and cooperation over multiple Issues.\n\nWhen multiple heroes work together on the same project, they shorten the timeline and increase the likelihood of success. Let teamwork feel rewarding, a testament to their shared commitment to keeping their fragile sanctuary alive.\n\n# \\<h1\\>When the hotel is compromised.\n\nNo hotel is 100% secure, and most will eventually fall. When a hotel is compromised, it creates a critical situation for your enclave. This event can be triggered by various factors, such as a large-scale attack by a zombie horde, a super zombie assault, or the discovery of the hotel's location by a dangerous faction.\n\nThis becomes a pivotal set of issues where the heroes must protect the enclave as they seek a new home. This can unfold over one or several issues, but it should be a harrowing experience as the heroes and those under their care are left without the protection of a hotel. The heroes will need to navigate treacherous terrain, fend off relentless threats, and manage dwindling resources, all while keeping the morale of their enclave from collapsing.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Founding a New Hotel\n\nWhen it comes time to build a new sanctuary, lean into the collaborative spirit of the game, the Editor-in-Chief sketches out the bare bones of the new location (its size, its quirks, and the dangers that come with it), but the players shape its heart. Their choices will determine what their next refuge becomes.\n\n**Building the Next Sanctuary**\n\n-   **Editor’s Foundation:** As the Editor-in-Chief, you define the bones of the new Hotel: where it is, what threats it’s vulnerable to, and what opportunities it offers. Perhaps it’s a half-collapsed hospital, a maze of subway tunnels, or a cluster of fortified rooftops connected by scaffolding. Every choice you make gives it potential and gives it problems, fertile ground for a story.\n-   **Player Investment:** Invite players to spend Plot Points, offer creative suggestions, and narratively invest in their new home. Maybe they scavenge better generators for reliable energy. Maybe they will uncover a forgotten armory and turn it into a Security Hub. The more they invest, the more personal it feels, and the more satisfying it is when they defend it. Encourage them to draw on their Skill Sets here, adding details that make sense for who their characters are and what they bring to the table.\n-   **Gameplay Decisions:** As the story unfolds, heroes encounter missions and challenges tied to the Hotel’s development, negotiating water rights with a nearby faction, clearing out a mutant nest occupying a key wing, or jury-rigging defenses to hold the line while the walls are still under construction. Each of these moments gives their new home narrative weight and reinforces that this isn’t just scenery, it’s something they’re fighting for.\n-   **Ongoing Development:** Once the heroes have settled in, the work doesn’t stop. They’ll need to maintain and improve what they’ve built, addressing damage, upgrading systems, and training new members of the enclave. A Hotel is never truly finished; it grows and evolves with the players and their story.\n\nBy involving players in the rebuilding of their new sanctuary, you keep them invested in its survival. Every wall they reinforce, every Facility they rebuild, and every survivor they save makes the Hotel more than just a backdrop. It becomes a character, a testament to their struggle and their hope.\n","size_bytes":64210},"docs/6.1_The World of RC.md":{"content":"**\\<H1\\> The World of Rotted Capes**\n\nCreating B-Listers and learning the rules is just the start of the game. In order to create fun **Rotted Capes** issues you’re going to need to think about the world and how the B-Listers are going to interact with it. This section offers information and advice on where to set your series, how to put together fun issues, and dealing with the human dramas.\n\nThere’s a lot of advice here but relax! Chances are that this isn’t your first time as an Editor-in-Chief and, even if you are, most of this is just helping you gather your thoughts when plotting issues. You don’t need to use all of this information for every issue or even every series.\n\nNow without further ado, let’s take a look at your setting.\n\n\\<h2\\>**Just Past Now…**\n\nThe world of **Rotted Capes** is our own, set approximately 2-4 years after Z-Day (or, more importantly, 2-4 years after you’re reading this). It’s not exactly our world, of course, but one with a four-color overlay. In keeping with superhero tradition you’ll probably want to base your campaign within or around a major city.\n\nThe default setting of **Rotted Capes** is Paradigm City. With the exception of the conceit that the world was our own when Z-Day hit. **Rotted Capes** also presumes that the geopolitical, economic, and technology of our present world was in place as well. This means that anything that is available to you now may be part of a **Rotted Capes** campaign. Portable and practical laser pistols and personal jetpacks are the province of super geniuses, not the world at large.\n\n\\<h2\\>**…Or Not?**\n\nWhile the default world of **Rotted Capes** is set in our own early 21st century, you may decide to place the Z-Day whenever you want. Perhaps Z-Day was Hiroshima, and the heroes must survive a world with ex-Axis micropowers (small states that carry on the principles of the Third Reich), Nazi Super Zombies, and A-Lister costumed heroes that weren’t much more powerful than the B-Listers. Maybe you’d rather set off Z-Day in the 1960s, when the superheroes of the Silver Age were just getting started. Or perhaps the 1980s is more to your liking, where the landscape resembles the post-apocalyptic films of the time.\n\nYou may even choose to go further afield, setting the game in earlier centuries or even the future, where the addition of superheroes gives a flavorful period feel (cyberpunk future, steampunk Wild West, or mythic Greece). So long as the campaign involves B-Listers trying to survive in a ruined, zombie-infested world, you have a game of **Rotted Capes.**\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**Using a Published Setting**\n\nWhile **Rotted Capes** is set in a four-color world similar to our own with its own iconic heroes and villains, you don’t have to use Paradigm City or even create your own. Instead, you can use a published setting by your favorite comic book company, television series, or even another RPG publisher. You can base your campaign around an established city from that publisher and decide which “A-Listers” were killed and which are currently Super Zombies. The Players may choose heroes that were on the B-List in the published setting or they may create original characters.\n\nThe benefit of this approach is that you already have a built-in superhero backstory to hook the players and create adventures. Even if you don’t decide to use a published setting as-is, you can certainly pull heroes and villains from those sources and give them a fresh coat of paint. Maybe that Super Zombie in the red and white tights used to fight for “Truth, Justice, and the Canadian Way!”\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<H1\\>What is Z-Day?**\n\nMost B-Listers and Bystanders refer to the event that caused the zombie aftermath “Z-Day.” The term itself is convenient slang for something unknown – most of the survivors have no idea how the zombie aftermath actually began. Numerous theories abound; alien invasion, magical mishap, government project, or super-villain plot gone wrong are just a few theories. So what is the truth regarding Z-Day?\n\nWe don’t know.\n\nOkay, that’s not entirely true. We do know, but for the moment your answer is as good as ours. **Rotted Capes** is not just a game of slugfests and survival; it’s also a game about exploration. Your players shouldn’t know what spawned the zombies, or if Z-Day was a one-time event or something that’s ongoing. This is your province as Editor-in-Chief.\n\nIf you want a happy ending, perhaps there is some method to end the Z-Day threat for good or even to reverse its effects; that’s very “four color” and very much a part of **Rotted Capes** if you want it to be. Alternatively, you may have the heroes discover that the Z-Day event pushed the world past critical mass; even if every zombie in the world were destroyed the survivors only have a few generations left.\n\nOr you don’t have to create a reason for Z-Day at all. Let your players stew about it and have their Heroes create theories based on what they’ve pieced together. You may even have two or more competing theories, each leading to new adventures and pulling the heroes in different directions. Better yet, let the players “figure out” the truth on their own, leaving you to run with it.\n\n**/Start_Side_Bar**\n\nPossible Causes of Z-Day\n\nSome Editor’s-in-Chief may feel that to properly tell their Rotted Capes series that they need to know what sparked the Z-Day Event. Below you will find some possible explanations that you can choose, discard or modify as you wish.\n\n1.  A naturally occurring virus, perhaps long dormant but now active once more due to the encroachment of civilization into areas that were once untouched by man (similar to what occurred with the Ebola Virus in our world), has been transmitted to humans through contact with infected primates, such as chimpanzees. Patient Zero was infected, traveled to a more populated region, died, was reanimated and began to feed, spreading the disease.\n2.  The virus was genetically manufactured by a government (foreign or domestic) or a maniacal villain. The spread occurred as in number 1 or was meant to have a different effect and was created as an airborne disease. While airborne and over time, the virus mutated and infected the entire population of the earth, making all humans carriers. Once a person dies, they are reanimated as flesh eating zombies. A fate that all people upon the planet will ultimately share.\n3.  For those wishing for a more supernatural slant, a sorcerous super-villain with ties to the Voodoo religion, enacts a ritual meant to give him ultimate power over the Risen Dead. The ritual has unexpected consequences and curses all the people of the earth to rise after death. In this scenario, Z-Day is a supernatural plague that cannot be cured by scientific means with the only possible cure residing in the realm of the mystic arts!\n4.  At the other end of the spectrum, the virus could have been seeded by an alien race or empire bent on ravaging our planet of its resources, but not wanting to deal with the living inhabitants. Their solution is to spread a virus (perhaps a nanotech virus) that reanimates the dead with a compulsion to attack the living. Within a few years, all the living populace would be decimated (or gone) leaving no one to resist the alien invasion.\n5.  \n\n**/End_Side_Bar**\n\n**\\<H1\\>A-Listers and B-Listers**\n\nThroughout **Rotted Capes** you’ve seen references to “A-Listers” and “B-Listers.” You probably also know by now what the terms mean. That said, the A-Listers are more than just the more powerful heroes and villains that died in the early days of the apocalypse. They are the stories that spawn adventures and are a part of your world’s mythology.\n\nWas one A-Lister particularly patriotic and/or inspiring? If so, then an enclave tries to live up to her ideals. Did a super-genius A-Lister have a bunker beneath the city? If so, then your heroes may risk zombie infection to find it. Was one A-Lister particularly connected to the heroes? If so, she is now a Super Zombie bent on their destruction.\n\nIn a similar vein, being a B-Lister is much more than “nobody special except for power X.” B-Listers are survivors; they’ve survived the initial zombie onslaught and they’ve learned valuable skills in the process. Their powers while few, give them an edge that helps keep the zombies at bay. Bystanders don’t distinguish between A-Lister and B-Lister; for them, a B-Lister is simply a Hero.\n\n**\\<H1\\>The Series City**\n\nStories about superheroes generally involve a city. This makes sense, given the number of Bystanders that need protection. Being the hero of a small town means you get to stop the occasional convenience store robbery or settle domestic disputes; being the hero of a city offers greater challenges. A city is also large enough to contain several superheroes and villains, enabling the heroes to make allies and take on several challenges; if your only enemy is Doctor Demon, then you’ve got little to do while he’s warming a prison cell after your last encounter.\n\nIn **Rotted Capes**, your series city is where most of the action takes place. Sure, it’s overrun with zombies and super zombies, but the city is also a place of great treasures and Bystanders that need rescuing. The enclave is never far from the city so that the occasional foraging party can grab canned food and other necessities from the many abandoned stores within the city.\n\nThe fictional Paradigm City is the default location for **Rotted Capes** series. It’s designed as an archetypal four color city with its own hometown superhero team, the Protectors, and a rogues’ gallery, as well as specific landmarks and local legends. You can easily use this framework as-is or as inspiration for “four-coloring” your own series city.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**On the Road**\n\nWhile **Rotted Capes** assumes an urban/suburban setting by default, there’s nothing stopping you from setting your campaign further afield. Indeed, one fun variant is the “road game,” where the heroes travel to different places each issue. This is different from a “caravan” enclave, where the B-Listers protect a group of traveling Bystanders. Instead, your B-Listers are Ronin, going from place to place in order to solve problems without creating any lasting ties. They may even be searching for something and contact enclaves in the hopes that they can find clues as to what they are seeking.\n\nWhile such a campaign doesn’t allow for deep exploration of a single area, it does allow an Editor-in-Chief to change the atmosphere with a different setting. The Heroes may simply be wanderers on the road, protecting travelers along the way, or the Heroes’ enclave may actually be a ship that scavenges from different ports.\n\nOne benefit of a “road game” is that you can spread out the B-Listers and super zombies so that each city only has a handful of super beings, rather than a single series city that is bursting with them. It also paints the bleak totality of an entire world gone to Hell, as opposed to a single city. The B-Listers may meet important characters from different parts of the world and find that solutions for one region may not be ideal for all regions.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<H2\\>Choosing Your City**\n\nThe first thing you need to decide when creating a **Rotted Capes** issue or series is where the action is going to take place. The “default” location for **Rotted Capes** is Paradigm City, which is described in various examples throughout this section. While we’ve done our best to give you a vibrant four-color city, there’s no reason why you can’t base your series in another city if you so desire.\n\nIf you’re sticking with the real world, a fun choice would be the city nearest you, especially if you live close by. This enables you to paint a clearer picture of the places that the Heroes are visiting. For example, if your heroes are operating just outside Philadelphia, telling them that they need to cross the Girard Point Bridge paints a vivid picture of a double decker bridge that sits over the Schuylkill River between the former Navy Yard and the airport, rather than telling them that they need to cross “the bridge that connects the suburbs to Generic City”).\n\nAnother good choice if you’ve run other superhero RPGs (or at least have the materials on your shelf) is to use a city, real or fictional, that featured prominently in your previous series. Assuming you have the same players, such a city may be almost as familiar to them as their own. You could also use an established city from elsewhere in fiction, such as the home city of a favorite comic book superhero or a favorite film.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**Real Maps**\n\nOne of the advantages to using a real-world city is that there are mapping websites that enable you to zoom in and get an accurate portrayal of an area. Google Maps (maps.google.com) is especially useful in that, not only can you zoom in fairly close (1 inch = 20 feet), but you can also get a “street view” of most metropolitan streets.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<H3\\>Paradigm City**\n\nParadigm City is a Midwestern metropolis with a Glory Days population of about 2,000,000. Built primarily as a railroad town by Henry “Hank” Walters in 1826 (Walters intended for it to be the model, or “paradigm” for future cities, hence its name), Paradigm City soon became a prosperous port city due to being built on the Blue River, which feeds into the Mississippi.\n\nDue to being a hub of trade, Paradigm City attracted many immigrants, making it one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the Midwest. It also garnered the nickname of “the Hub of America,” since most business crossing the country went through it. The numerous railroads also enabled the suburbs to prosper and, as time wore on, many of the closest suburbs were absorbed into the city proper.\n\nParadigm City was part of the Union during the American Civil War and was part of the Underground Railroad. During this period Paradigm City’s first costumed hero, the original Night Lord, who primarily aided escaping slaves and confronted slave hunters. Night Lord was also Paradigm City’s first African-American superhero, although his costume disguised this fact.\n\nDuring the Gilded Age many wealthy industrialists increased their fortunes through Paradigm City and organized crime began taking over the distribution channels, primarily by exploiting new immigrants. Paradigm City was in need of heroes, and several costumed vigilantes answered the call. Unfortunately, corrupt industrialists and mob bosses bankrolled costumed villains and a secret war raged in the alleys of the city.\n\nNight Lord reappeared, as did other heroes. The Blue Bullet, true to his name, used a pistol that fired bullets made of blue-tinted lead. Spring-Heeled Jack was an English immigrant who used shoes with springs, amongst other gadgets, to surprise his foes.\n\nAmongst the first costumed villains were the Brass Brawler, who employed heavy knuckledusters, the Butcher, a knife specialist, and the Frog, an Asian martial artist that wanted to go by the name of “the Jade Tiger” but couldn’t shake the appellation given to him by an eager journalist of the **Paradigm Chronicle**.\n\nIt was during the dawn of the 20th Century that an event occurred to which most Conspiracy Theorists point to as the cause of the advent of the “super-being”. On June 30th, 1908, a meteorite or comet burst apart violently over Tunguska, Russia, flattening trees for hundreds of square miles of the uninhabited wilderness of Siberia. A few months later, in on September 7th, another, even more violent airburst occurred over the area between Fairbanks, Alaska and the Yukon Territory of Canada. Witnesses say that the blast was so massive and so much energy released, that the very glow of the Aurora Borealis changed color to a steady red for the rest of the year.\n\nThe connection between this event and the emergence of the “super-being” was made in 1925 when biologist and fervent eugenics advocate, Dr. Hans Claust, published a paper claiming that the generation born just after the Yukon-Charley Event would be known as the Generation of the “Übermensch”, given the surprising rise of costumed heroes who enjoyed seemingly amazing natural powers. While these super-human abilities pale in comparison to those exhibited by the Heroes of the Golden Age, they were unprecedented during the time of the paper’s publication. Though many scoff at Dr. Claust’s work as an attempt to advance the now discredited theory of eugenics, many concede that each generation born after the Yukon-Charley Event does exhibit those born with more and more powerful and wondrous powers and abilities that were unknown previously.\n\nDuring the same period of time in the continental US, Paradigm City continued to grow at a rapid pace. Between the two World Wars many of the original Heroes continued to operate, although journalists speculated that they weren’t the originals. Additionally, a new breed of costumed hero rose, seemingly not needing gadgets to assist them in manifesting their modest super powers.\n\nOrganized crime got a boost in the 1930s when a mysterious gadgeteer known only as Professor Gojkovic, outfitted villains with a variety of gadgets. The villains Armadillo (who wore an armored vest), Tommy Gun (who favored a submachine gun with a variety of specialized bullets) and Azrael, a hit man that took his name from the fact that he could fire from so far away it was like the bullet came from the heavens) were three of Professor Gojkovic’s beneficiaries.\n\nParadigm City’s first “super-villain” also came out of the 1930s when an industrial worker accidentally fell into a vat of chemicals that made his skin bulletproof. He turned to a life of crime as Diamond Dan and was quite successful before his enemies realized that invulnerability did not equate to “invincible.” Interestingly, his final defeat didn’t come at the hands of heroes but rather a rival mob, which fitted him with “cement shoes” and dropped him into the Blue River.\n\nAfter World War II Paradigm City’s suburbs exploded and the city became a hub of manufacturing thanks to an automobile plant and a popular brewery. The sudden appearance of “mutant heroes” in America coincided with the Red Scare of the 1950s and efforts were made to tie them to Communism (as it turned out, the Soviet Union was busy interring their own mutants and forcing them to work for the government) and wanted all mutants to go public and register their powers as if they were firearms. Both the Korean conflict and the wars in Southeast Asia kept the various registration acts off the table and by the late 1960s the social revolution made any talk of registration moot.\n\nA financial boom occurred in the 1980s as white collar business exploded. Downtown Paradigm City became dominated by increasing numbers of skyscrapers. The 1980s and 1990s also saw a boom in the number of superheroes, including Lady Liberty and a new Night Lord. With the end of the Cold War, SuTech (Superior Technologies), an international weapons supplier and elite mercenary force, broadened their market and supplied many super-villains with battlesuits, war machines, and other gadgets, many of whom found their way to Paradigm City. Perhaps the strongest of these was Iron Star, a former Soviet soldier that had been cybernetically enhanced in the mid-1980s. Along with the immensely powerful super-human christened the Judgment of the People, these two Soviet Super Soldiers gave many of Paradigm City’s premier heroes many an epic battle.\n\nThe early years of the 2000s saw the rise in patriotic superheroes again as 9/11 galvanized patriotic fervor. Captain Freedom and Red Rocket (later changing her codename to Shooting Star) appeared during this decade. Unfortunately, it also saw the economic collapse of Paradigm City as downsizing companies took advantage of new technologies to outsource their operations.\n\nIn the final years of the Glory Days, Paradigm City was a shadow of its former self, although there were signs of a comeback as the city aggressively pursued gentrification and tax breaks for corporations. Things were just starting to turn around when Z-Day hit, destroying the city, and civilization, forever.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Glory Days in the City**\n\nWhether you decide to use Paradigm City, a real city, or a fictional one (either published or of your own design) it helps to know what that city was like during the Glory Days. You’ll want to know the general geography and various landmarks that make your city unique. You’ll also want to know what superheroes and super-villains populated your city, both when Z-Day hit and throughout the city’s history.\n\nSuch details are more than just a historical exercise; they are the elements of your series. They can also be the springboard for an issue or plot element, as well as references for flashback scenes. A good rule of thumb is to think about your city as if you were going to run a modern four color superhero series without the zombie horror elements. What would be important for you to include? Where do your villains hide? Why do they want to terrorize your city as opposed to somewhere else? Do your city heroes work as a team? Are there any lone wolves or anti-heroes?\n\nWhile nailing down all these details can be a bit overwhelming, there are a few areas where you should concentrate most of your efforts. Here are a few things to consider when thinking about the Glory Days.\n\n**\\<H3\\>Who Were the A-Listers?**\n\nIn the typical superhero city, there is always at least one Hero that is seen as its protector. Most cities actually have several such heroes and sometimes they even band together in a clubhouse. Similarly, there are usually one or more villains that become part of the hometown heroes’ rogues’ gallery.\n\nYou’ll want to flesh out your A-Listers. Who were they? What powers did they wield? Did they have secret identities? What were their personalities, goals, and desires? Were they part of a group? Did they have minions or sidekicks? Who were their usual nemeses?\n\nIn addition to thinking about your A-Listers, you’ll also want to give some thought to any secret headquarters or base of operations. Did your A-Lister keep super vehicles handy? Did she need a laboratory to develop her latest potions? Did he have a spare battle suit stored somewhere?\n\nFinally, you’ll need to decide what happened to them. Did they die in the initial wave? Did they become super zombies and, if so, are they still kicking? If the A-Lister survived, then where did she go? What is she doing today?\n\nRemember also that any A-Listers with special equipment may have left that equipment lying around in the city. Where did Thunder Hammer drop his weapon when he was killed? The Steel Sentinel Super Zombie is missing several pieces of his battle suit; where did they go?\n\n**\\<H3\\>Paradigm City’s A-Listers**\n\nParadigm city has always been a hotspot for superhuman activity. The following are some of its major A-Listers when Z-Day began. Unless otherwise stated, all heroes below belonged to the Protectors.\n\n**\\<h4\\>The Sentinel:** Justin Jordan has been Paradigm City’s premier hero since he returned from World War II. He continued to work with ParaChem and the government as well as being a charter member of the Protectors. Possessed with superhuman strength, speed and a thick skin that only the highest caliber shell could break, Sentinel never-the-less fell during the first days of zombie outbreak, though no one knows if the Hero of Paradigm City is resting in peace or turned into a ravenous Super-Zombie.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Thunderbird:** Tommy Redbird was a city attorney and member of the Miami tribe. He has the ability to generate intense heat which enables him to fly, throw fire bolts, and create a heat force field (Tommy was fully aware that the Thunderbird was not a Miami myth nor a fire creature). Thunderbird was one of two A-Listers that survived the Z-Day. He went to Oklahoma to check on relatives and hasn’t been seen since.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Behemoth:** One of Professor Gojkovik’s later experiments, the Behemoth broke free and became a reluctant hero in Paradigm City. He resembles an overly large man with bulging muscles, grey slate armored skin, and tufts of hair all over his body. He also had no memory of who he was. Rumors abound that the Behemoth has been seen, still alive, in neighboring cities. Why he has not made an appearance in his “home town” of Paradigm City is unknown.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Lady Liberty:** Samantha Pyle was born with the mutant ability to fly. She also wore bracers that fired concussive bolts of energy. In her secret identity she was a political science professor at the Caswell School in Paradigm City University. She survived Z-Day and protected an enclave with her sidekick Torch for six months before she was turned.\n\n**\\<h4\\>The Ronin:** Paul Kitsune was the son of the Blue Dragon, a yakuza enforcer. Paul rejected his father’s criminal culture and fueled his martial arts abilities with Ki energy. He had the good fortune to partner with someone who had a revolutionary idea for computing and became a very successful businessman. He was also a philanthropist and built the largest Buddhist temple in the Midwest. The Ronin disappeared after Z-Day.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Night Wolf:** Another of Professor Gojkovik’s experiments, Night Wolf can become a “wolf-man” with extremely tough skin. Roberto Vasquez was a college student when he was kidnapped and transformed. After his rescue by the Protectors, Night Wolf decided to become one of them. He wanted to be called “Black Wolf” but a politically sensitive editor dubbed him “Night Wolf” on the network news. Night Wolf was Z’d while battling the hordes of dead at the infamous Vesper Hall event.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Shooting Star:** Jasmine Hainesworth was a promising athlete when she shocked everyone in high school by leaping for the basketball net and, with a burst of mutant energy, flew straight through the gym ceiling and safely landed in the parking lot outside. Moving to Paradigm City, she became a psychiatrist and school guidance counselor. As a hero, she always preached maintaining high ideals, which got her torn apart when she faced the Z’d Titan.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Gearjack:** Trey Gavin was always building things as a kid, so it was no surprise when he became the top engineer at Nova Phoenix Technologies in Paradigm City. Trey built a battlesuit to fight crime. He was thought killed in Z-Day but resurfaced several weeks later wearing a new battlesuit created from scraps. Gearjack was finally Z’d a few months ago when his power source failed and he was forced to abandon his armor.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Titan:** Known as the gentle giant of herodom, Titan was one of the most beloved heroes of Paradigm City. Eschewing wearing a mask of any type Titan, Frank Mancino, became one of the first “public heroes”. Dividing his time between battling his nemesis, the Judgment of the People and doing commercials and guest appearances on a variety of TV shows, he became an instant celebrity and the hero of the “common man”. Titan was thought lost when he was last seen trying to save a bus load of bystanders from the Risen Dead, the survivors later learned to their horror that the good natured hero had been turned into one of the most malicious Super-Zombies.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Blue Bolt:** Once the fastest man alive, the Blue Bolt is now the fastest of the dead. In his late 40’s and semi-retired when Z-Day hit, Donald Goss donned his blue and yellow uniform and raced to save as many of his fellow citizens as possible. Though credited with rescuing hundreds about the city, the Blue Bolt disappeared a week into the cataclysm of the zombie plague. It was only later, that a task force from the CDC realized that the accelerated spread of the Z-Virus was due to the blue speedster, who appears to have been infected during the opening days of the outbreak. Due to his hyper metabolism, the Super Zombie Blue Bolt was forced to feed at an accelerated rate, hastening the spread of the disease world-wide. The last sighting of Blue Bolt took place in China, as the Hero of the People’s Republic engaged him upon the Great Wall.\n\n**\\<\\<INSERT ART PROF\\> GOJKOVIK\\>\\>**\n\n**\\<h4\\>Professor Gojkovik:** Also known as the Eternal Man, Prof. Gojkovik is known to have lived at least 200 years, based upon vintage pictures from the 1800’s that show the professor looking much as he does today. Gojkovik is not a true immortal however. A bio-chemical savant, Gojkovik has extended his life through the use of various chemical concoctions and arcane formulae, but his ultimate goal of immortality appears to have eluded him thus far. Professed to be an expert in such disparate fields such as cybernetics and necromancy, Gojkovik also professes to be the world’s foremost expert on the super-human condition, being an eye-witness of the very first ubermensch to the wondrous heroes of today. Throughout the Golden Age, he has outfitted would-be villains with weapons, armor and other tech for a hefty percentage of heir take. Since the outbreak of the Z-Virus, the whereabouts of the Eternal Man remain unknown.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Mad Hatter:** One of the most colorful crime lords in Paradigm City, Alexander Napoleon (likely not his real name) fashions himself after the character of Professor Moriarty of Sherlock Holmes fame. He has the ability to control minds and emotions. The Mad Hatter usually dresses in a black Victorian evening suit and insists on speaking with a dodgy English accent. His crimes are often overly elaborate and flamboyant, which garnered him the sobriquet of “the Mad Hatter.” This only incensed the crime lord, as he wanted to be known as “the Napoleon of Crime.” The Mad Hatter was Z’D, but he seems to control zombies just as well as humans now, dressing his “minions” in Victorian garb. B-Listers that have seen him since his transformation note that there doesn’t seem to be much difference between human Mad Hatter and super zombie Mad Hatter.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Haley’s Comet:** Hailee Ford was a low-level clerk in a big city office when she missed the train one morning. Desperate to catch it, she rushed to the platform just as the train was pulling away. Suddenly, Hailee had a burst of speed and ran right past the train and into the city on her own power. When she questioned others, they saw only a white blur. Hailee decided to use her power to supplement her income and became Haley Comet. When Z-Day hit she fled the city. No one’s sure what’s happened to her since.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Bastet:** Lucy McGee was diagnosed with a multiple personality disorder and committed to New Bethlehem Developmental Center just outside of Paradigm City. One of her personalities claimed to be the reincarnation of an Ancient Egyptian priestess and used sorcery to break free. In addition to her sorcery, she has the reflexes and abilities of a cat, along with extra sharp nails and catlike eyes. Most of Bastet’s crimes revolved around stealing artifacts, especially Egyptian ones. She was turned a few months after Z-Day and it is believed that her sorcerous powers may actually be mutations, as her super zombie self can still use them.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Cold Snap:** Martin Phillips was a high school history teacher and historical re-enactor. He always knew he had the ability to create and control cold weather and ice, but his abilities were minor. One day, he was assaulted by the boyfriend of a fellow teacher he fancied and, panicking, Martin impaled him with an ice spear. He felt strangely empowered by the act and decided to inflict himself on all sorts of “injustices,” which he defined as anyone he perceived to have wronged him. He repurposed a Union Cavalry uniform and Frozen Custer was born. When Z-Day came, he actually sided with the heroes. No one is sure what happened to him after the initial assault; most presume he was turned but there are rumors that he froze himself in self-defense (see **Legends and Artifacts**).\n\n**\\<h4\\>Atlas:** Byron Wade was an up-and-coming boxer who made money breaking legs on the side. His life changed forever when, while suffering a particularly brutal beating in the ring, his skin turned to stone. He’d have killed his opponent with a punch had it not been mitigated by the suddenly heavy boxer falling through the ring. Since then, Atlas worked as an enforcer for the Benton Mob. Atlas has been sporadically sighted since Z-Day, but no one is sure whether the stone man is human or zombie.\n\n**\\<h4\\>The Judgment (of the People):** Once the leader of the *Super Soviets*, the premier super hero group of the former Soviet Union, the Judgment of the People, with his iconic hammer and sickle, became discredited when he was reported to have attempted to assassinate former Soviet Premier Gorbachev in an effort to stop the collapse of the communist paradise. He was stopped by members of his own super team and disgraced before the people who once adored him. Blaming the capitalists from the West for the destruction of his beloved Motherland, Judgment, as he now called himself, was determined to destroy the United States in retaliation. Luckily, a variety of heroes including Titan, who Judgment repeatedly called ‘a lap dog of capitalism’ for his frequent commercial enterprises, rose up to stop the mad Russian. At some point during Z-Day, Judgment appears to have become infected and has ironically made his lair in the tallest tower of the financial district, preying on the working man, rather than protecting him.\n\n**\\<H3\\>The Ascended B-Listers**\n\nAs B-Listers are, aside from zombies, the key element of **Rotted Capes**, you’ll need to understand what they were before the Z-Day. In general terms, B-Listers were attached to A-Listers as sidekicks or minions, but there are other ways B-Listers might have lived in the Glory Days. Here are a few ideas.\n\n-   The B-Lister ignored her power. After all, with A-Listers around who needed a hero that could swim really fast? Even if she wanted to be a Hero, the A-Lister villains were just too powerful. It was better to live as a Bystander.\n-   The B-Lister was a minor Hero. Sure, he couldn’t fight in the big leagues, but there were many criminals that lacked superpowers. Even a single power or martial training was often enough, combined with physical training, an awesome costume, and a scary reputation, to take down “street level” foes.\n-   The B-Lister was a minor Villain. Maybe she was a mob boss or worked as a chief enforcer. Maybe she was a cat burglar that used her power to pull off lucrative crimes while staying off the radar of A-Lister heroes. Maybe she was a bit of an anti-hero, enough so that A-Listers generally left her alone.\n-   The B-Lister was a police officer. She used her powers for law-enforcement.\n-   The B-Lister was a celebrity. A B-Lister with emotion control could be a charismatic preacher/speaker, while a B-Lister with mind control might be a politician. Attractive B-Listers that can do their own stunts would be in demand in Hollywood.\n-   The B-Lister’s power didn’t manifest until after the Z-Day. Maybe his power manifested at adolescence or the stress of the world collapsing caused it. Maybe he found a discarded piece of super equipment from an A-Lister. Maybe he took to martial training in order to survive in the zombie aftermath.\n\nIn addition to determining what the B-Lister did before Z-Day, you’ll need to determine what happened to her afterwards. Some B-Listers obviously don’t make it and many become super zombies. Others may attach themselves to enclaves or wander the countryside alone. Many will form teams with other B-Listers, whether they used to be friend or foe. Some may even continue being super-villains, offering protection in return for service.\n\n**\\<H3\\>Paradigm B-Listers**\n\nThe following is a list of B-Listers currently roaming the Paradigm City environs. Most of them could be considered allies, although it wouldn’t take much to goad any of them into a fight if one isn’t careful. Some enclaves just aren’t big enough for two B-Listers.\n\n**\\<h4\\>The Torch:** Becca Rose was a young lounge singer that discovered she could literally light up a stage. She was soon taken under Lady Liberty’s wing as the Torch, a hero that could surround herself in a sheath of fire and hurl fire bolts. When Z-Day hit she protected citizens while Lady Liberty tried to confront the threat. When the city was lost she helped Lady Liberty establish an enclave. She became its chief protector when her mentor was turned.\n\n**\\<h4\\>The Executioner:** John North was an enforcer for the Richmond Mob. While he had no powers, he carried around a lot of lethal hardware and soon became known as the Executioner. After Z-Day hit he used everything he had to gun down as many zombies as he could. Rather than join an enclave, it’s said that the Executioner prowls the area, uncovering weapons and ammo and using them to destroy more zombies.\n\n**\\<h4\\>The Shield:** Gabrielle Gomez was a pilot in the air force when a meteor struck her jet during a routine exercise and knocked her jet out of control. She would have crashed had the Sentinel not caught the jet, but the meteor exploded. Somehow, the Sentinel returned to the ground with an unharmed Gabrielle. The Sentinel got permission to take Gabrielle to ParaChem to run some tests. He discovered that Gabrielle could reflexively emit a force field. Gabrielle soon found herself fighting crime alongside the Sentinel as the Shield. Unfortunately, she discovered soon after Z-Day that her force field did not make her immune to infections.\n\n**\\<h4\\>The Defender:** Sasha Lin was a high school student in a rough neighborhood; she took martial arts classes for self-defense. When one of her friends was killed in a drug deal gone wrong, Sasha determined never to let that happen again, not in her neighborhood. She pushed her training and became the Defender, using valuables taken from “bad guys” to bankroll a bullet-proof cat suit and a collapsible metal staff. She currently protects a small enclave near her old neighborhood, trading in the bludgeoning staff for a dual-bladed sword-staff (the better to hunt zombies with).\n\n**\\<h4\\>Silver Star:** Shooting Star’s protégé, Tom Sawyer had the rather less impressive ability to create glittery sparkles that could temporarily blind and confuse opponents. While of limited use against super-villains, Silver Star soon discovered that his power did slow zombies down long enough for people to escape. He carries a machete to take full advantage of a distracted zombie. Currently, he and Red Falcon protect a large caravan.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Red Falcon:** Ming Chou was a burglar that purchased a flying harness from Professor Gojkovik to further his crimes. He ran afoul of Shooting Star who captured him and then interceded on his behalf to reduce his sentence if he pledged to work with underprivileged youth. Red Falcon agreed and had been doing so for several months before Z-Day. He joined forces as Shooting Star’s protégé to protect a caravan.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Cherry Tree:** Amber Myers was an angry young college student that didn’t believe in “the system.” One day, when challenging a professor in class whether she really believed what she was espousing, the professor candidly admitted that she usually just parrots whatever her political party was promoting. The professor lost her job during the resulting fallout and Amber realized that she could compel anyone to tell the truth. She became a political activist and adopted the identity of Cherry Tree after the legendary incident with a young George Washington. After Z-Day, she’s discovered that her power is useless against zombies but can hold an enclave together or tear it apart based on how she uses it.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Shotgun:** Gary Bachman was just a shoe salesman when Z-Day came. Frightened, he abandoned co-workers, family, and friends alike to hide from the zombie menace. Gary wasn’t proud of his actions and, once he realized the full extent of what was happening, loathed himself for being such a coward. While foraging, Gary came across a large blast rifle that had belonged to Gearjack. It was solar-powered and thus self-reloading. Calling himself Shotgun, Gary now moves from enclave to enclave protecting people.\n\n**\\<h4\\>Bullfrog:** Arthur “Artie” King was a bouncer at the Speakeasy, a themed restaurant that covered the early twentieth century. Many former heroes and their descendants loaned costumes and equipment to the restaurant; most such items were either fake replicas or no longer functional. Artie was thrilled to discover that the Frog’s old outfit still had some bounce in it. He stole the costume during the Z-Day fallout. Artie had to stretch the costume over his thick, muscular build and decided to call himself Bullfrog. He currently protects a medium-sized enclave.\n\n**\\<H1\\>Law Enforcement**\n\nAnother consideration to make for your series city is the nature of law enforcement. Were the police equipped to deal with super beings or did they largely stay out of the way and call in the military when things got too rough? Were actual super beings part of the police force?\n\nIn any case, survivors from law enforcement probably play a big role in an enclave, protecting Bystanders as they already have or even take control of the leadership (e.g. the local police chief is now enclave leader).\n\nIf law enforcers were largely irrelevant in the Glory Days, then any survivors may revel in the new order. A-Listers could ignore them; B-Listers can’t. Weapons that used to be completely ineffective are now effective most of the time.\n\nIf the law enforcers did have the resources to deal with super beings, then those resources may either be with the enclave or still in the city; another treasure to be looted. Members of Super SWAT teams may even be B-Listers themselves in the zombie aftermath.\n\nGiven the apocalyptic nature of Z-Day, it’s likely that the National Guard or even the national armed forces were brought in to contain the threat. This means that the city is littered with military hardware, some of which has filtered into the enclaves. Scavengers love military equipment as they have a high barter value.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Paradigm City – Law Enforcement**\n\nEarly on, Paradigm City realized the need for a stronger police force in the face of increasing super activity. Prior to World War II, submachine guns were often enough, as the “costumed heroes” weren’t much more than heroes and villains with intense physical training, and the occasional truly superhuman was often held in check by other costumed heroes.\n\nIn 1975 the state governor sought to end the super-villain problem while allaying the citizens’ concerns by putting a National Guard base just north of the city. The National Guard had all of the special weapons and equipment the state could afford to give it, and the local Guard Commander was only a phone call and a few minutes away from the Paradigm mayor. This arrangement proved effective later in the year when a National Guard “scramjet” destroyed several elemental creatures created by the super-villain “Magister Maximus” Diabolus.\n\nSince that time, Guidry National Guard Base became the best-armed National Guard installation in the state. It eventually boasted a wing of space-capable super-aircraft, a dozen specially armed tanks, and three battle-suited troopers.\n\nWhen Z-Day hit, Guidry sprang into action and was responsible for most of the counterattacks and targeted damage (such as the city bridges) in Paradigm City. The base itself became a sanctuary. Unfortunately, in spite of its vast capabilities Guidry was unprepared for such a large scale threat and collapsed within a few months, completely overrun with zombies.\n\n**\\<H1\\>The Neighborhood**\n\nIn addition to the city and its suburbs, you’ll also want to note any distinguishing areas. Nearby military bases are big, as are “big box villages,” shopping malls, and supermarkets. Many of these are already CFB but may contain loot if the zombie infestation in the area is heavy.\n\nFloating sanctuaries are also possible around port cities. Unless zombies are proficient swimmers (most aren’t) a boat can provide great protection for an enclave. Similarly, penthouses also offer great protection so long as an enclave can hold off super zombies.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Paradigm City – The Neighborhood**\n\n**\\<h3\\>Sunrise Medical Center:** Sitting on the Blue River just north of the zoological gardens, the Sunrise Medical Center was one of the premier medical facilities in the Midwest, if not the entire country (The Ronin was responsible for many donations and ParaChem donated a wing). It’s been mostly picked clean and generally considered CFB, although this has more to do with the rumor that a super zombie has made it her lair. Intrepid looters can usually find something worth bringing back to the enclave, assuming that they do return.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Guidry Airfield:** Home of a former National Guard Base, Guidry airfield lies a few miles north of the city. Most of its airplanes were either taken or wrecked along the airstrips during the Z-Day attack, but there are enough pieces available for a gearhead to patch a working plane together. Unfortunately, most of the oil was scavenged by local enclaves as anti-zombie weapons.\n\n**\\<h3\\>PC International Airport:** Located on the outskirts of the city, Paradigm City International Airport once served as a major hub to a few major airlines and serviced a variety of flights from around the US and the world. Since the advent of Z-Day, the airport was quickly deserted as desperate citizens and visitors eager to escape the plague jammed the terminals. Among those harried travelers were some of the infected and as delays and cancellations forced herds of people gather close together, they presented a tasty smorgasbord for the newly Risen! Most avoid the airport due to the hordes of zombies trapped in a confined space, but there are still those who wish to brave it for the untapped riches in fuel, tools and spare parts that lie in the hangars.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Museum of Antiquities and Natural History:** Located near the heart of the city, the museum was forever at the heart of several mysteries and adventures dealing with undead, mystic or cursed artifacts, and the sundry antediluvian sorcerer or megalomaniac risen from stasis. Since Z-Day, the exhibits wonders are wasted on the dead that walk its endless corridors. Rumors abound that this is where the Zombie Lord has his lair ,surrounded by his shambling subjects and the items he coveted while he was still among the living.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Wildland Amusement Park:** Opened in 1986, the Wildland Amusement Park is a sprawling amusement and waterpark that celebrates the various eras of American history and included an American Safari experience where patrons could drive their cars through a park filled with American animals. Most of the animals have since been poached for food.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Blue Crossing Shopping Center:** This is a collection of “Big Box” stores along the Blue River southwest of the city. It’s named for the bridge that crosses the Blue River and this bridge is still standing in the zombie aftermath. The Blue Crossing Shopping Center is a popular loot site for local enclaves, although it is rapidly approaching “closing sale” status.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Stonevale Outlets:** This outlet mall sits on the western side of the Blue River six miles north of the city. It’s OFB, but primarily for clothing and footwear.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Rabbit Creek Park:** This park sits about two miles west of the Stonvale Outlets and surrounds a large lake. A small enclave once made a lashed-together floating hotel in the center of the lake until they unfortunately discovered that zombies could walk underwater. Rabbit Creek itself heads southeast and joins with the Blue River in the northern part of Paradigm City.\n\n**\\<h3\\>New Bethlehem Developmental Center**: This psychiatric hospital campus sits five miles southeast of the city and several super-villains were committed here since its establishment in 1936. Of particular note was the “Cinderblock,” the colloquial name for a Supermax prison built on the property for the most dangerous super-villains. Some say that the Cinderblock remains home to an enclave that uses the imprisoned super-villains for their own purposes.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**Farming**\n\nZombies only seem interested in human flesh and don’t normally produce more collateral damage than a drunken barfly trying to make her way home. Theoretically, this means that an enclave could farm without worry that zombies would destroy the crops. Several enclaves in thinly populated areas do just that.\n\nFarming is not without risks. Zombies have a way of slipping into fields, even when fenced, and are constant threats to farmers. Zombies also tend to move as a herd, meaning that dozens, even hundreds, may arrive and overrun a farm. Finally, super zombies have the cunning to know that, where there’s cultivated land, there’s meat.\n\nEnclaves close to cities farm on a small scale. A Hotel may have a small garden and a caravan may have easily transportable plants. Such gardens won’t produce enough to sustain an enclave, but every fruit and vegetable helps.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<H2\\>City of the Dead**\n\n**\\<\\<INSERT** ART Full page map of Paradigm City\\>\\>\n\nSo far, you’ve been concentrating on the city as it was; now it’s time to design the city as it is. Where in the city did the initial battle take place? It’s probably the area that’s taken the most amount of damage. Similarly, where did law enforcement or the military strike? These areas are likely peppered with bullet holes and missile craters, not to mention the occasional fallen building. Automobiles probably still litter the streets.\n\nOther means of zombie containment may have also left their mark on the city. Bridges have been blown up, subways and regional rail lines destroyed; even a makeshift wall may surround a city or, when things got real desperate, a cowering enclave.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Paradigm City – Areas of Note**\n\nParadigm City is huge, over 600 square miles. Prior to Z-Day it was one of the largest cities in America and a shining beacon of art and industry in spite of the economic downturn. It would be impossible to detail every major building and neighborhood. Instead, here is a selection of notable buildings and features of downtown Paradigm City.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Centennial Park:** Centennial Park is a park that takes up the equivalent of eight city blocks. It is dominated by a monument that sits in the center, topped by a statue of the Sentinel looking over the city (at least until the skyscrapers of the 1970s and later dwarfed it).\n\n**\\<h3\\>City Hall:** Set in the heart of the city on the north end of Centennial Park, Paradigm City Hall was largely untouched during Z-Day attack and, except for the occasional bullet hole and shattered glass, remains standing as it was in the Glory Days. The primary reason for this is that, anticipating super-villain attacks, City Hall’s frame was hardened and a heavy bunker built beneath it. It’s possible that the essential members of the City Government are still sitting in the bunker, but it’s just as possible that they were all slaughtered or turned before they made it to the bunker.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Metropolitan Museum:** Dominating the western part of Centennial Park with its neo-classical façade, “the Met” was an art and history museum. Many residents raided it for useful zombie-fighting tools such as medieval swords and axes. The façade is partially collapsed due to a stray missile being deflected by a super zombie. Many of the weapons and armor pillaged from the Met can still be found in surrounding enclaves.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Vesper Hall:** Set on the south end of Centennial Park, the Vesper Square Music Hall is Paradigm City’s premiere location for operas and symphonies. Originally entitled City Music Hall, it became Centennial Music Hall when the city sold it to private investors in 1985 (after being disused for almost a decade). It became Vesper Hall in 1998, when philanthropist Anna Vesper gave it an endowment. Vesper Hall is where the tide seemed to turn against the super-heroes, as an entire concert audience turned into zombies. The entire building is now caved in, the victim of a surgical missile strike.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Daily Crier Building:** Paradigm City’s biggest newspaper, the Daily Crier is still housed in the art deco building downtown that was built in the 1930s. It was once the best news source in the city before television broadcasts and the internet dwarfed it. It was purchased by NBC in the mid-1990s and acts as a print supplement to its parent broadcasts. The Daily Crier website launched in 1997 and was much more widely read than its print parent and the NBC news broadcasts. Most people recognized the building from the giant eagle launching itself over the building sign. Today that brass eagle lies battered and broken on the street in front of the building.\n\n**\\<h3\\>ParaChem Labs:** A campus with many research facilities, ParaChem Labs was one of the premiere chemical research centers in America, if not the world. Part of it became the Weir School of Chemistry, attached to Paradigm University. Many B-Listers believe that ParaChem had something to do with Z-Day, although no evidence exists to confirm it. Notably, the original zombie nest in the city was located in Vesper Hall, not ParaChem Labs.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Olympic Motors:** Promising an affordable electric automobile, Olympic Motors was given several grants, loans, and endowments in the latter part of the 2000s. Unfortunately, in spite of creating several successful fully electric cars, Olympic never solved the affordability issue nor did the city build the infrastructure necessary to make the cars convenient. Nevertheless, several electric cars are still sitting in the factory and don’t need gas to operate.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Tower:** The nickname for the headquarters of the Protectors, this large building was donated to the Protectors by wealthy dilettante Harold Soames (Soames was rumored to be a Protector in the 1980s). The Tower sits north of the zoo on the Blue River and many citizens fled to it via the Washington Bridge before the National Guard blew the bridge to contain the threat. Unfortunately, the Tower proved unsafe when the Z’d Protectors instinctively returned home. It now sits abandoned and partially collapsed.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Skyway:** The Skyway connects most of the commercial buildings downtown via a pedestrian walkway on the second floor. It spans from Vesper Hall to the Paradigm City Convention Center and used to terminate in the west via a bridge that ended in a staircase down the zoo (this bridge was also destroyed by the National Guard).\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Lone Tree Mall: T**he premiere shopping center in the city, the mall got its nickname from the enormous pine around which the mall was built. Four stories high, the mall boasted a bowling alley and multiplex theater in addition to the dozens of shops and eateries. The Lone Tree Mall is also the center of the city skyway and the subway. It’s literally possible to take a train into the city and arrive at one’s office without ever venturing outside.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Metropolitan Subway:** Colloquially known as “the Metro Way,” this subway winds through downtown and most of the major neighborhoods, connecting with regional rail lines. The subway project is a new innovation; the earliest portions only date back to the mid-1990s. The impetus was super-villainy – the previous elevated trains proved tempting targets and, after an attack on one such train in 1993 caused numerous casualties, the City Council approved construction of a subway system. While the subway tunnels are still useful for loot teams that don’t want to risk exposure, they are just as suitable for roaming zombies (and a death trap if one encounters a super zombie).\n\n**\\<h3\\>Riverside Park:** Wedged between Downtown and the Blue River, Riverside Park is the largest outdoor recreational area of the city with numerous walking and biking trails, a couple of ponds (frozen over for ice skating in winter) and three gorgeous bridges that have been used as staging areas for most Paradigm City wedding portraits. Numerous statues and monuments of historical figures, both superhero and mundane, are scattered throughout the park. Riverside Park was also host to a couple of ferries that had been remodeled as pleasure boats. Both were converted into cruisers after Z-Day.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Sports Center**: Several arenas comprise the Paradigm City Sports Center south of the Paradigm inner beltway; the Second Financial Field (football), Paradigm Bank Park (baseball), and the CableNet Arena (ice hockey, basketball, and other events). A fourth arena, Paradigm Field, was the previous football field and slated to be demolished. With Z-Day, that never came to pass. At least one enclave still calls the Sports Center home.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Paradigm City Convention Center:** This large building takes up two city blocks and is host to numerous conventions throughout the year. As it was close to the initial Z-Day attack its interior has only been lightly looted and chances are that the stock from any convention that happened to be going on inside the center when Z-Day came is still there, well-preserved and in large quantities.\n\n**\\<h3\\>City Market:** A large indoor marketplace for food and wine purveyors, the ceiling is two stories high, making the skyway through here a promenade. Even after being closed for two years, the City Market still carries the smells of its wares. In spite of its location, City Market is still a destination for looters looking for better quality dry and canned goods. Rumor has it that the freezers still run, indicating a treasure trove of goods for the risky looter.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Zoological Gardens:** Sitting just on the other side of the Blue River, the Zoological Gardens was a favorite spot for residents and tourists. While the zombies have no use for non-human flesh, the animals were purged for food stock by humans in the early months after Z-Day.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Gaming Stores:** Paradigm City was home to two premiere comic and gaming stores, the Imperial Outpost and Game Board, which attracted an eclectic clientele from around the city and its suburbs, with an enormous selection of comics and games (the reading of those dealing with zombies and the zombie apocalypse may award the reader with a +1 bonus to their Survival skill at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion). Additionally, one of these stores was rumored to hide one of GearJack’s secret workshops. With the armored hero Z’d and his whereabouts unknown, if this secret workshop were to be found, it could contain a treasure trove of equipment and supplies that might mean the difference between life and death for one of the beleaguered enclaves of Paradigm City.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Legends and Artifacts**\n\nThe A-Listers were involved in some epic stuff back in the Glory Days and many of these legends persist in the present. One legend holds that “sanctuary” is actually an orbiting satellite that once served as the headquarters of a superhero team. Another legend tells of a sanctuary that was a super-villain’s private island.\n\nIn addition, artifacts tend to be found at the places of which the legends speak. If the Wrecker made a heroic last stand to keep the zombie horde off fleeing Bystanders, then chances are his Hammer of Destruction is still lying near the spot. Similarly, the Alchemist’s utility belt may still be in the center of town where he fell from the clock tower during an epic battle with the War Monger super zombie.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Paradigm City – Legends and Artifacts**\n\nAs befitting a city of legends, Paradigm City has bits and pieces of super-equipment and headquarters strewn about. Of these fragments legends are made and many B-Listers and Bystander looters are willing to brave the deserted, zombie-ridden city to find them.\n\nNote that all of these legends are just that, legends. Any artifacts may or may not exist and the entire incident or legend may just be a rumor. There’s something comforting in knowing that evolved zombies may not want to eat you, or that a cure has been discovered. Such legends have a way of sticking around even in the face of massive evidence to the contrary.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Patient Zero:** Since Z-Day, rumors have persisted that there is a Patient Zero and that he or she may be in Paradigm City. The rumors also state that this patient may hold the cure for the zombie plague and the cure might be as easy as shooting Patient Zero. Others scoff at the idea, claiming that the Z-Day had nothing to do with an initial patient but was more likely a trans-dimensional breach or alien attack.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Cure:** It’s inevitable that this legend frequently pops up. The usual variations include a secret bunker and three or four degrees of separation between meeting a “cured B-Lister” or messenger. Skeptics point out that many victims may think they’ve turned when a last-minute burning saves them; this did not stop at least three small enclaves from being wiped out while venturing into the city to find the miracle cure.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Evolution?:** There are reports that a small cabal of “mundane” zombies have actually retained their human intelligence and are now organizing into a new civilization. It’s also rumored that this group isn’t necessarily hostile to humanity. Is this true and, if so, should the humans try to destroy them or support them?\n\n**\\<h3\\>Professor Gojkovic’s Hidden Base:** Having plagued Paradigm City for decades Professor Gojkovik is believed to have a base hidden somewhere near the city and that this base may contain many items useful against zombies and super zombies.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Gearjack’s Battle Suit:** Everyone knows that Gearjack died after being forced to remove his battle suit. What no one is certain of is where he left it or, more accurately, where the super zombie that attacked the empty suit left it. Some people believe that the intact suit is laying about waiting for someone to re-energize it, while others believe that the battle suit was shattered, leaving lootable pieces all over the city.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Speakeasy Pickings:** Prior to Z-Day, the Speakeasy was a bar-restaurant that showcased superheroes and had several pieces of superhero memorabilia, some of it still operational if one has the secret codes or know-how to reactivate them. Many such items were looted from the Speakeasy and dropped nearby when their new owners couldn’t figure out how to use them.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Robotic Salvation:** There are many variations of this popular legend. It is believed that a super-villain (Mad Hatter, or Professor Gojkovik are the usual candidates) was building a robot army somewhere within Paradigm City before Z-Day hit. If this army can be found then it may be programmed to hunt zombies. Such an army would have nothing to fear from infection. A few versions of this legend warn that activating the robot army would be a mixed blessing, as it would attack human and zombie alike.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Frozen A-Listers:** This legend states that, during the initial Z-Day attack, Cold Snap realized that the heroes could not win and encased himself and several other heroes in ice, assuming that the zombies could not get to them. Legend has it that the ice tombs still exist somewhere along the city Skyway; several theories abound as to how Cold Snap is able to keep the heroes frozen in warm weather and whether anyone so entombed is still alive.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Guidry’s Arsenal:** While Guidry National Guard Base collapsed over a year ago, it is believed to still hold a number of weapons caches and possibly secure bunkers. Even now, looters still can’t reach the lower levels. Perhaps some remnant of the National Guard still huddles within, waiting for the appropriate time to emerge and take the fight back to the zombies.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Cyberzombie:** There’s a legend that a cyborg super-villain, possibly Iron Star, was turned into a super zombie but the mechanical part of his brain has enabled the cyberzombie to maintain his intellect. He now hunts zombies and super zombies without fear of infection. Unfortunately, he still needs human flesh to survive and regrettably takes them when he needs them. Such a creature would be a powerful ally for an enclave, so long as they can tolerate his eating habits.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Purifiers:** Not all humans struggle for salvation. There are those that believe this world is damned and that the best thing they can do is remove what is left of humanity, freeing their souls to ascend to Heaven rather than be consumed by the forces of Hell and condemned to roam the world forever. No one is certain whether this group exists or what motivates them; nevertheless the rumor of such a group makes enclaves even more suspicious of strangers.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Hair of Recovery:** It’s rumored that Professor Gojkovik is not only still alive, but also possesses the ability to clone people, even after they’ve been turned. The secret is in their hair which, as “dead organic matter,” is immune to the zombie virus. This hair can be used to clone a healthy replacement with all of the superpowers of the original. Unfortunately, it has no memories, but the “Clone Doctor” can download previously taped memories into it, either from the original (with any memories gained after the taping lost), or another “donor.” Needless to say, the implications of such technology existing can enormously reshape the series.\n\n\\<\\<INSERT ART Balor vs Titan\\>\\>\n\n**\\<H1\\>Building Issues**\n\nCreating **Rotted Capes** issues (more commonly called “adventures”) may seem easy at first, especially for “beer and pretzels” games. Simply create an area, populate it with zombies and the occasional super zombie, give the heroes a goal, and let them loose.\n\nCrafting issues for a continuing series can be quite a bit of work. While the “beer and pretzels” formula can be used again and again, it won’t be long before your players feel the sameness. One way to change things up is to think about your series city and the types of situations that your heroes would logically find themselves facing.\n\nThis section is designed to help you design interesting **Rotted Capes** adventures. In addition, we offer several plot hooks for you to flesh out and create full issues.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**Raiding Maps**\n\n**Rotted Capes** takes place in a largely abandoned (at least by the living) version of our own world. This means that many modern building plans and layouts can be repurposed for **Rotted Capes**. Need a mall? Use the floor plan of any major mall – its website will give you at least the pedestrian areas, leaving you to fill in the rest according to logic (and you can always make those areas inaccessible rubble). Raiding a big box store? Just use one you go to regularly; it’s easy to visualize.\n\nAnother good source of maps can come from other RPG products, so long as they take place in the modern day. Historical floor plans also work; many buildings are kept up and upgraded as necessary (an old Georgian building may have window air conditioners and lines running for cable and internet access).\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<H2\\>Basic Issue Template**\n\nAt its core, **Rotted Capes** has a very simple premise: the B-Listers must maintain the survival of their enclave (yes, it’s possible that the B-Listers don’t have an enclave but that’s a tangent; most series will revolve around an enclave). Here’s how you can quickly and efficiently design Rotted Capes issues.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Build your Sandbox**\n\nIn roleplaying parlance, a “sandbox” is the area in which the B-Listers are allowed to travel. Even if you plan on writing very focused issues with little room for wandering, you’re going to want to understand the neighborhood. Here are the following factors to keep in mind.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Series city:** Are your B-Listers from Paradigm City or somewhere else? What neighborhoods and shopping centers exist around it? Are there any special locations? Who were the A-Listers and B-Listers? Are there any Clear Zones?\n\n**\\<h3\\>Enclaves:** How big is the enclave? What kind of government does it have? What resources are available? Where is it located? How do your B-Listers fit in the enclave? Are there other enclaves nearby? How does your enclave get along with them?\n\n**\\<H3\\>Set a Goal**\n\nEvery issue in **Rotted Capes** should have a goal, something the B-Listers need to do or fail to do in order to bring the issue to a conclusion. This goal should be simply stated; “escort the loot team to the supermarket and back” or “rescue the Bystanders trapped in a shopping mall” make fine goals.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Set Obstacles**\n\nEscorting a loot team to the supermarket wouldn’t be much of an issue if nothing happened along the way to complicate things. How many zombie assaults must the loot team endure? Is there a super zombie in the area? Is there something that makes the journey itself more difficult, such as a destroyed bridge or rough terrain?\n\nFor single session issues, it’s best to limit obstacles to three-five scenes. This ensures that you’ll be able to wrap up the issue within a single evening. You can simply multiply this number for multiple sessions.\n\n**\\<H3\\>Set Plot Twists**\n\nPlot twists or surprises are things that the B-Listers must deal with that they hadn’t anticipated. A traitor within the loot team is one example; so is the fact that a major zombie horde is heading to the supermarket, making the mission a race against time. Perhaps the supermarket is almost CFB and a rival enclave loot team is trying to secure the same loot (and is willing to fight for it). Perhaps an old super-villain nemesis picks now to settle an old score with the B-Listers.\n\nA plot twist can also be a personal drama. Perhaps a love triangle has heated up and the B-Lister involved has to protect her rival on the loot team.\n\n**\\<H3\\>Create an Endpoint**\n\nAn endpoint is the place in the issue that the B-Listers must get to in order to end the issue. This is usually the return to the enclave, but that may not necessarily be the case, especially if the enclave itself is under attack (in which case the endpoint is a safe distance the enclave must travel). Once the endpoint is reached or circumstances make it impossible to reach, the issue is finished and the B-Listers are given an appropriate experience point award.\n\nYou may wish to create multiple endpoints if it’s possible to end the issue in other ways other than success or failure. In a base under siege example, one endpoint may be ending the zombie threat while another is getting the Bystanders to safety from an overrun Hotel.\n\n**\\<H3\\>The Graphic Novel Treatment**\n\nSimply put, a graphic novel is simply an issue with a lot more meat. Generally, the Editor-in-Chief makes the plot elements darker and grittier (steering away from camp), but this need not be the case. A graphic novel has more obstacles, plot twists, and personal story arcs than the average adventure.\n\nTaking that into consideration, it should come as no surprise that a graphic novel is going to take several sessions to complete. You’ll probably plot it like a miniseries although rather than discrete issues you’ll have something more analogous to the chapters of a book. Each chapter builds on the previous one and sets things in motion to be resolved in future chapters.\n\nGraphic novels aren’t shy about making sweeping changes to B-Listers, Bystanders, and enclaves. The stakes are raised to accentuate the grittiness. Throughout the course of the story many B-Listers and Bystanders may die or be permanently altered; enclaves could get decimated or destroyed. It’s not uncommon for an idealistic B-Lister to be thoroughly broken by the end of a graphic novel or for an amoral anti-hero to find something to believe in (oftentimes just in time for a heroic death).\n\n**\\<H3\\>Building a Miniseries**\n\nAn issue generally has one main plot. A miniseries is several issues tied together in a short story arc. Generally speaking, a mini-series usually consists of three to six issues with a story arc that starts with the first issue and is resolved in the last issue.\n\nUnlike a full series, the story arc of a miniseries is often tightly plotted; it may even be a single plotline that simply takes a long time to resolve. In such cases subplots can often fill the role of single issues. A good example of a miniseries is moving an enclave from one location to the next. The first part of the story involves safely evacuating the Bystanders when their old Hotel is compromised, protecting the Caravan on the road while scouting for a new Hotel, making the new Hotel safe, and finally taking care of the super zombie that’s been hounding the enclave since it led the attack on the old Hotel.\n\nIn most cases, a miniseries is a succession of related issues that build towards a satisfying conclusion. You might have as a story arc a rebellious Bystander looking to take over the Leadership. While the B-Listers spend each episode performing missions, the rebel is gathering resources and allies for a coup. In the final episode the coup is sprung and the B-Listers have to support a side.\n\nOne of the things that make a miniseries desirable is that it’s focused. With a finite number of sessions to plot a story arc, an Editor-in-Chief can corral her best ideas and incorporate them; there’s no room for padding. You also, hopefully, leave your players wanting more once the miniseries is over.\n\n**\\<H3\\>Building a Series**\n\nA series is simply a succession of issues or miniseries. There may be an overall story arc (or multiple story arcs) or there may be none at all; the series is simply a collection of issues on survival in the zombie aftermath.\n\nThe benefit of an unconnected series is that each episode provides closure if the series needs to end; there’s no story arcs left hanging and the players can easily pick up where they left off should the series start again.\n\nAn unconnected series also maintains unpredictability. With a story arc, your players generally have some idea of where you’re heading after a few issues. With a series, you’re limited only by your whims. In a sense, this is the best way to play **Rotted Capes**, as, like in the zombie horror genre, the unpredictability fosters uncertainty and your players will have no idea what you’re going to throw at them next.\n\n**\\<H1\\>Tipping the Balance?**\n\n**Rotted Capes** is a fusion of the superhero and zombie genres. One way to differentiate adventures is to emphasize one genre over the other (there can be alternating emphases for each adventure). An adventure with the same goal can feel very different if the Editor-in-Chief chooses to run it as a superhero slugfest versus a zombie survival scenario.\n\nFor example, let’s say that the adventure involves sneaking into an old villain lair and stealing a power source that the enclave needs. In a superhero-emphasized adventure, the heroes fight their way through zombies, enter the lair, and face a super zombie. Once the threats are neutralized, the adventure is over.\n\nIn a zombie survival scenario, the focus is more on the war of attrition. The vehicle that the heroes used to get to the lair is destroyed. The heroes fight their way to the lair (ticking off bullets as they go) only to discover that the power source is partially depleted. The lair also has a super vehicle, but using the power source to power it depletes it further. Do the heroes take the risk or do they take the more dangerous route of trying to bring the power source back on foot?\n\nMore broadly, the Editor-in-Chief needs to decide on the tone of her campaign, which ranges from “camp” to “gritty.” Both the superhero and zombie genres have drifted between both. The 1960s **Batman** television series and the 1999 film **Mystery Men** is camp, as is the 1992 time-traveling zombie movie **Army of Darkness**. The 1986 graphic novel **Watchmen** (and its film adaptation) and the ongoing **Walking Dead** television series tend toward “gritty” portrayals.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**Doesn’t “B-Lister” imply camp?**\n\nWhen playtesting **Rotted Capes** many players assumed that the game was camp because of the term “B-Lister.” While that’s certainly one valid interpretation, we designed **Rotted Capes** with the idea that the players would be playing low-powered heroes, as the powerful ones got killed or infected soon after Z-Day. We wanted to draw a distinction between those heroes and the ones that weren’t quite ready for prime time. These “B-Listers,” or “sidekicks” were entrusted with keeping Bystanders safe (avoiding rather than confronting zombies) and had to step into the void left by the A-Listers.\n\nIf you’re running a gritty series and the term “B-Lister” is throwing your players off, replace it. Just call the player characters “heroes” and, if you need a term, call the A-Listers “mega heroes.” Sometimes all it takes is a word substitution to change the feel of your campaign.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<H2\\>Camp**\n\nA “camp” style doesn’t take itself too seriously; at its most extreme it doesn’t take anything seriously. Tropes are exaggerated and dark moments, such as a Bystander or B-Lister getting killed or infected, are often played for laughs.\n\nWhile they often walk hand in hand, camp is not necessarily comedy. The series need not become farcical nor does the Editor-in-Chief need to introduce situations merely for a few chuckles. The keys to camp are “absurdity” and “naivety.”\n\nThe entire premise of **Rotted Capes** fits the definition of absurdity. The notion of a superhero world that followed the four-color tropes of superhero comic books until a zombie apocalypse turned the world upside down can hardly be described as anything else. That said the absurd premise does not necessarily make your series of **Rotted Capes** campy. The circumstances and situations derived from the presence must also be designed with camp in mind. The closer you hew to realism, the less campy it becomes.\n\nFor example, assume that you and a handful of friends wake up tomorrow and discover you have superpowers. Are you immediately going to don spandex bodysuits and fight crime? Are you going to create a thematic name and catchphrase? Do the citizens of your town immediately accept you as a superhero? The realistic answer to all of these questions is “no.” If you were in a campy universe, however, then the answer would be “yes.”\n\nNaivety, as broadly defined here, is the “buy-in” of all characters involved of the absurd premise and situations. They react as if such premises were normal. In a full-on campy series, the B-Listers may, true to their nickname, have powers of dubious utility, such as the ability to read minds only when someone is speaking, the ability to conjure a cigarette-lighter sized flame, or the ability to glide on windy days. Such B-Listers actually end up acting like pre-mutant costumed heroes; they are athletic martial artists whose powers very occasionally become useful. Still, they don themed costumes, come up with catch-phrases, and fight crime (and zombies), because they were gifted with a power and feel the responsibility to use it for good.\n\nB-Listers generally fall into two categories: white hats and black hats. Heroes are heroes and villains are villains. Heroes want to make this rotten world a better place; villains want to exploit it. This is not to say that heroes and villains can’t work together (indeed, the very premise of **Rotted Capes** presumes that players can be heroes or villains from the Glory Days now banding together for survival). Instead, a camp series presumes that all characters can easily identify each other unless a failure to do so is the plot point of an issue.\n\nFor example, perhaps during the Glory Days the Kitten was a cat burglar who had a good heart but extreme kleptomania that fueled her crimes. In the zombie aftermath, the Kitten is now a B-Lister that works with the rest of the team, but her teammates know that if they come across anything shiny she’ll risk anything to acquire it. They also know that she has a secret stash of purloined items somewhere and, with a wink and a nod, occasionally ask the Kitten if she’d be able to procure some immediately useful item for them, knowing full well that she’s just going to raid her stash.\n\nBystanders, too, have to buy into the camp. They don’t make fun of the absurdly tight costumes (or, in the case of many female heroes, the impractical “fetish” outfits that leave too much flesh exposed and too little to the imagination). Obviously, wearing such an outfit would be suicidal when facing infectious zombies, but in a camp series a female hero wearing the equivalent of a bikini swimsuit doesn’t risk infection any more than her head-to-toe clad teammates.\n\nCampy series don’t worry about the nitty-gritty of realistic survival *unless* it is a plot point in the current issue. Bystanders in an enclave aren’t constantly starving; a heavy-weight Bystander with a sweet tooth and pockets filled with favorite candies is comic relief, not a constant target of hungry B-Listers. When he is targeted, it is usually by the occasional pick-pocket or con artist that swindles him out of his candy, even after the Bystander has declared “she won’t get me next time.”\n\nCampy enclaves tend to be pockets of order in the zombie aftermath. B-Listers aren’t expected to serve a ruthless regime; if one emerges, it is the plot point of an issue and must be dealt with in a way to return the enclave to normal operations. At all times, the B-Listers should be allowed to be heroes.\n\nThus far, we’ve concentrated on the camp superhero, but zombie survival can be played for camp as well. When a B-Lister goes into the city for supplies, she isn’t accosted by generic zombies; she’s attacked by a group of zombies that used to be ex-boyfriends, co-workers, or bosses (usually not family; there’s often little camp value in thinking of one’s loved ones as creatures needing to be killed).\n\nSimilarly, the Enclave’s efforts at survival are more easily maintained than in a gritty survival series. Maybe the enclave has to deal with a zombie infestation along the road to a known food source, but once the menace is cleared the looters can load up and the enclave is saved. There’s never a chance that they get there and find the place picked clean.\n\nAs another campy example of zombie survival, the enclave Hotel may be in little danger of being overrun and is connected to the city via subway. The subway still works and each morning the scavengers line up at the station and discuss the day’s business as if they were still Glory Days commuters. They ride the train into the city, spend the day salvaging and dealing with zombies, and load the items they’ve scavenged into the train for transport. They return home as night falls, lamenting lost comrades as “retired.”\n\nFor B-Listers, the focus of most issues is super zombies. A former A-Lister returns as an undead menace and must be dealt with by the B-Listers. Being camp, the super zombie usually retains any fatal flaws it had in life; the B-Listers must use this fatal flaw against it in order to survive.\n\nMany of the personal issues described in the **Enclaves** section work well in camp series. A true hero does have to balance his personal life against his costumed one. In a camp series, though, loved ones tend to remain true; a neglected significant other may tease his partner that he may look elsewhere for companionship, but he’s never truly serious. When such a circumstance does occur, it’s from the unwanted advances of the B-Lister’s rival.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**Gun Control**\n\nOne element crucial to both the camp and gritty styles is gun control. Simply put, access to a lot of weapons moves the emphasis from superpowers to hardware. Rather than rely on their powers, heroes will simply “weapon up” to the point where they are walking weapons lockers rather than B-Listers. This violates the principles of both the camp and gritty styles, for different reasons.\n\nIn a camp series, B-Listers rarely use guns because it isn’t part of their image. A B-Lister that was a two-fisted hero in the Glory Days is likely to remain a two-fisted hero in the zombie aftermath, although she is expected to take a few more precautions. She isn’t likely to whip out a gun at the first sign of trouble and may even argue against their use in many situations.\n\nIn a gritty series, B-Listers are more likely to reach for the guns, but circumstances often give them pause. Bullets are hard to come by and, absent a regular cleaning regimen, guns have a tendency to jam after a few uses. Small caliber weapons have a difficult time dropping zombies. Even the Deathwatch would prefer to use more primitive weapons, such as swords and bows, for regular patrols, keeping the guns safe until they are truly needed.\n\nStill, players being players, it’s likely that their B-Listers are going to arm up at the first opportunity. The Editor-in-Chief can control this by limiting the amount of ammo available. This isn’t unrealistic; most ammunition was used up in the hours and days after the Z-Day hit and frightened survivors rarely worry about their bullet count when the zombies are marching on them.\n\nRemember too that, as a scarce resource, guns and ammo are valued. There are many Bystanders that would like to get their hands on them and wouldn’t hesitate to use subterfuge or violence to get them. Many enclaves keep a close eye on their firearms and supplies, but keeping things in one place causes its own problems. One flood, explosion, or zombie infestation could make the weapons and ammo unusable.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<H2\\>Gritty**\n\n**\\<\\<INSERT** ART: A “gritty” Hero looking into a mirror and seeing his “Campy” version.\\>\\>\n\nThe “gritty” style puts a heavy emphasis on realism. The B-Listers are heroes that have to help an enclave of frightened Bystanders struggling to survive in a world gone mad.\n\nIn a gritty series, the focus is more on the day-to-day struggles of survival rather than the super zombie-of-the-week. Several issues may pass between super zombie sightings, although regular zombies are a constant threat. This is a subtle and crucial change; in camp, zombies are cannon fodder that inconveniences the B-Listers before the main event when the super zombie arrives. In gritty campaigns, the regular zombies are the main threat and when a super zombie does rear its undead head in the enclave’s direction, it ups the level of danger to almost overwhelming proportions.\n\nPersonal issues certainly play a part in gritty series, but they have to share time with the issues of maintaining an enclave. If the enclave is in a hotel, then the B-Listers will be involved in helping the Deathwatch maintain the perimeter, shoring up defensive walls, and securing food and supplies. The B-Listers are less “heroes” and more of an enclave resource. The enclave government understands that B-Listers need the enclave just as much as the enclave needs them, perhaps more so. The threat of exile can be used to keep B-Listers in line.\n\nA gritty series puts a lot of emphasis on scarcity. Food, clothing, and weapons are jealously guarded, as are working cellphones, smartphones, and laptops (one could pull from real world headlines and do a little social commentary on the obsession with getting (and stealing) the latest fashionable footwear). Enclaves perceived to have more of these things would be the envy of other enclaves and cause friction amongst them.\n\nA gritty series also makes some actions questionable. A group of B-Listers may escort a Loot Team through dangerous territory, facing hordes of zombies and losing several Bystanders along the way, take on a super zombie and lose one or two B-Listers, only to get to their destination, a supermarket, and find that it’s already been mostly picked clean. Was all of that worth a few cans of pasta meals and green beans?\n\nWhen it comes to drama, there are no white hats and black hats; everyone wears shades of gray. Today’s hero could be tomorrow’s villain, and B-Listers and Bystanders constantly surprise themselves by taking stands opposite to what they thought they were capable of making. Such decisions are understandable, but they leave a bad taste.\n\nIt’s even worse for B-Listers. In a world that needs heroes, Bystanders look up to B-Listers as paragons of heroism. Each time a B-Lister reminds them that it’s not always the case, all B-Listers are diminished. Many B-Listers hold on to their Glory Days values not because they still believe in them, but because they want the Bystanders to believe in B-Listers. When even your heroes fall, what hope is there?\n\nOf course, it’s possible to apply the gritty trope to B-Listers as well; they don’t need to be camp. Heroes in gritty series often dump the spandex for something more durable or fashionable, such as leather, Kevlar, or even a jumpsuit with a lot of pockets to keep all those great gadgets. Many heroes forego costumes altogether and, when necessary to disguise one’s appearance, take a page from the costumed heroes of the 1930s and adopt a simple domino mask or face-concealing scarf.\n\nGritty heroes often became heroes out of necessity; they took on the villains because they were the only ones who could. They tend to be pragmatic in approach, something that serves them well in the zombie aftermath. Many have psychological issues as well; what compels someone to put on a mask and become a crime fighter? Worse, what other issues might such a person have?\n\nGritty heroes generally aren’t content to stay on political sidelines. If an enclave Leader or government isn’t doing the job then the heroes won’t hesitate to step in and run the enclave themselves. Unfortunately, the cure is often worse than the disease, with the heroes becoming worse autocrats than the administration they replaced.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Rotted Capes Tropes**\n\nAs mentioned in the **Introduction**, **Rotted Capes** is a fusion of the superhero and zombie genres. Deciding how far you want to push camp or grit is only part of setting the tone. You’ll also want to identify and incorporate the various tropes that make **Rotted Capes** unique from its parent genres while taking inspiration from them.\n\nWe’ve put common superhero and zombie horror tropes in the sidebars. We used these tropes when we blended them into **Rotted Capes**. If you decide that you want to lean more towards one genre or the other, these tropes lists should give you some guidance.\n\nNow, without further ado, here are the blended tropes specific to **Rotted Capes**:\n\n**Light Gray Hats:** B-Listers are generally heroes, even if they were super-villains in the Glory Days. For some, this is born out of necessity, as they couldn’t survive otherwise. Even the most ardent hero, however, sometimes has to make choices that she doesn’t feel comfortable with in order to keep Bystanders safe in an unforgiving world.\n\n**Super-villains:** While the occasional super-villain is still out there, the “super-villain niche” is now occupied by super zombies. These creatures have all of the powers they had in life, but none of the personality. Super zombies can’t be reasoned with; they can only be avoided or destroyed.\n\n**Costumed Heroes:** B-Listers still wear costumes and use codenames even if they no longer bother protecting their identities. Costumes are practical; they reduce the risk of zombie infection and they cover up burn scars. They are also good for identification, as most B-Listers have enough of a Glory Days reputation that strangers will recognize them. Many B-Listers adopt sturdier, more resilient versions of their old costumes, favoring heavy cloth or leather to spandex.\n\n**Battle-Scarred:** While B-Listers still have the “ideal form,” it looks better with a costume on. Beneath, a significant portion of the B-Lister’s body is riddled with battle and burn scars. Most B-Listers also don’t have the time or equipment to keep their hair and body washed and teeth cleaned. B-Listers with heightened smell often have a difficult time around their peers.\n\n**Renewable Resources:** While enclaves are pockets of civilization, they live in constant threat of losing the resources they have, from guns to food. The Deathwatch is very careful about what it expends to keep the enclave safe. B-Listers, on the other hand, tend to rely on their powers, which is a renewable resource. Many enclaves benefit by having one or more needs handled by a B-Lister with an appropriate power. Also, while the enclave runs low, there’s always a place somewhere nearby that is OFB. The enclave just needs to send a loot team to retrieve it.\n\n**Small Victories:** The world has gone to the zombies. B-Listers have little chance of ending the threat or even holding firm; often the most they can do is buy time. Unlike the “level playing field” superhero trope, B-Listers often find themselves outclassed by zombie hordes or powerful super zombies. Still, the B-Listers do eke out small victories on a regular basis, enough to keep them going. Maybe they’ve taken out one super zombie, scored major loot, or discovered a hotel that will protect the enclave for another month or two.\n\n**Enclave Drama:** B-Listers often have to deal with their enclave politics and personal relationships as much as with zombies. Such situations are often part of both the superhero and zombie horror genres and are covered quite extensively in the **Enclaves** section.\n\n**Fatal Flaw:** Super zombies often retain the fatal flaws that they had in life and B-Listers can exploit that to the benefit.\n\n**Bystanders:** All enclave members need protection from the B-Listers, even the capable ones. All it takes is one too many zombies or a super zombie to turn an armed-to-the-teeth Deathwatch soldier into a cowering Bystander.\n\n**Tragic Retirement:** Because of their frequent and hazardous work, most B-Listers eventually become super zombies. Unfortunately, their former allies are often forced to kill them, especially since the new super zombie remembers where its old enclave is located.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**Superhero Tropes**\n\nThe following tropes are common within the classic superhero comic book genre.\n\n**Vigilante Desire:** The heroes aren’t content to let the police handle criminal activity. While the Ronin could shadow and observe a crime in progress, he isn’t content to call the police and let them handle it; he has to take down the bad guys on his own.\n\n**Super-villains:** While super-villains aren’t necessary for superheroes to exist, they certainly encourage them. Super-villains are often flashier than the heroes and concoct grandiose plans that only a superhero can thwart.\n\n**Moral Code:** Almost all superheroes follow a moral code that prevents them from killing or taking justice too much into their own hands. Strangely, this code often extends to super-villains as well. Kidnapped hostages are rarely abused or permanently injured.\n\n**Reduced Lethality:** No matter what a hero’s personal code or villain’s scheme, superhero issues are rarely filled with lethal violence. Bystanders get kidnapped, minions get beaten up, and super-villains are imprisoned. Permanent injury or death is rare and, when it happens, it’s usually a plot point.\n\n**Balancing Act:** Superheroes are more than just costumed vigilantes; they also have private lives with personal issues. These private lives can sometimes be, and usually are, more interesting than their super battles.\n\n**Costumes:** The one clear distinguishing feature between superheroes and other heroic archetypes is the presence of costumes. Often spandex-tight and brightly colored (conceits owing their existence to the new color printing of the Golden Age as well as the fact that muscle definition can be more clearly seen and looks much better on an inked figure), costumes serve the purpose of announcing a hero’s presence while concealing her true identity.\n\n**Ideal Form**: One of the reasons superheroes look so good in spandex is because they tend to have bodybuilder physiques and perfect proportions. All men are square-jawed and handsome with no signs of pattern male baldness, and all women are stunningly beautiful. This often extends to their non-powered significant others, family, and friends as well (unless specifically drawn against type). This is rarely treated as more than average within the superhero genre.\n\n**Codenames**: Going hand in hand with the costume is the codename, the title a superhero uses when out in public. Codenames are usually chosen to fit the hero’s powers, a costume theme, or a symbol. Captain (later Major) Justice chose her name because of her military rank and desire to promote justice (as well as being the definition of her given name). Thunderbird chose his name because it reflects his Native American heritage (had he been going for a more thematic bird then he’d have chosen the Phoenix).\n\n**Home City:** Most superheroes protect a specific area, usually a major city, from organized crime and super-villains. They can get very territorial about it when a visiting hero edges in on their turf, even to help. Such a home city usually gets the lion’s share of super-villain and alien attacks.\n\n**Costume Adaptation:** For some reason, superhero costumes tend to be undamaged by superhero powers and sometimes adapt to accommodate them. A hero that can fire bolts of energy from his hands never burns off his glove, and a hero that can grow three times her size finds that her costume conveniently grows with her. Sometimes this costume adaptation is explained, but oftentimes it is just handled with a wink and a nod.\n\n**Historically Insignificant:** In spite of superheroes springing up with strange powers and the ability to create super-scientific gadgets, they never manage to impact the world in a meaningful way. Gearjack may have invented an efficient electric car in 2002, but in the ensuing decade it has not managed to put a dent in the sales of internal combustion engines. Nor do superheroes have a major impact on historical events; many heroes participated in World War II, but the outcome is the same. Part of this is explained by the “cancel out” argument; the actions of superheroes and super-villains tend to cancel each other out as far as historical impact is concerned.\n\n**Deathtraps:** Super-villains rarely kill a superhero outright. Instead, they stick them in an elaborate deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. They are often surprised when the heroes break out of them.\n\n**Monologues:** Both superheroes and super-villains have a tendency to get long-winded. A super-villain enjoys gloating about his latest plan (as the superhero can’t possibly survive, right?) while superheroes often make great speeches in the heat of battle about the rightness of their cause or the dastardly deeds of their opposition.\n\n**Pre-Team-Up Scrapping:** If two superheroes who’ve never met do meet, they often start fighting with each other. Sometimes this is due to mistaken identity (one hero is investigating a crime scene when the other shows up) and sometimes this is the superhero version of barroom boasting that ends in a fistfight. Often the two heroes patch things up in time to face the true super-villain of the issue together.\n\n**Bystanders:** B-Listers often had to protect Bystanders in the Glory Days, as they lacked the power to protect themselves. Super-villains tended to exploit Bystanders that had personal relationships with the B-Listers.\n\n**Level Playing Field**: It doesn’t matter if the super-villain is wearing a battlesuit and hurling balls of mystical energy, the acrobatic superhero armed with only her martial training and hollow metal staff can hold her own (especially if said hero is aware of the super-villain’s fatal flaw). If a superhero team goes against a super-villain tem, then enemies of roughly equivalent power levels face off against each other.\n\n**Fatal Flaw:** Almost all superheroes and super-villains can be affected by something that renders their powers useless or weakens the hero or villain to a degree where she can be better affected by her opponents. Sometimes this is an attack type that the hero has no defense against, other times it is an object whose mere presence causes the villain to collapse and start dying.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**Zombie Horror Tropes**\n\nThe following tropes are common in the zombie horror genre. Some of these tropes are also from the related post-apocalypse genre.\n\n**Gray Hats:** There are no heroes and villains, only humans and zombies. The humans struggle to survive in any way they can and this often leads to tensions and outright betrayal (“better you than me!”). They also come from all walks of life in every shape and age. It’s not always easy to tell who can be trusted and who will work against you.\n\n**Survival, not Winning:** Zombie horror is about surviving until someone more powerful can save you or the threat disappears on its own. The protagonists rarely understand what is happening, much less how to defeat the zombies. Those protagonists that do try to go toe-to-toe with zombies usually end up as food or converted.\n\n**Lethal World:** By its nature, zombie horror racks up a high lethality count. People are killed indiscriminately, regardless of whether they take precautions. Large communities of survivors are often completely destroyed, save for a token few, by the end of a zombie horror story. Most of the friends and family of the protagonists are either dead or turned, often before the story begins.\n\n**Dwindling Resources:** Guns are handy, but eventually you’ll run out of bullets. Your car eventually runs out of gasoline, if it bothered to start in the first place.\n\n**Living Dead:** While typically animated corpses, zombies tend to retain their senses. They can still see through their eyes and have a heightened sense of smell. More importantly they can eat flesh. These traits still occur even when an individual zombie’s body is in bad condition.\n\n**Brains!** Flesh-eating zombies have a particular taste for human brains.\n\n**Headshots:** Zombies can survive dismemberment, but being shot in the head (or brain) destroys them.\n\n**Infectious:** Zombies can transmit their condition to the living. It is usually transmitted through a bite or scratch.\n\n**Slow Shamble:** While averted in some more modern zombie films, traditionally zombies have a slow, shambling walk, easily identifying them from a distance. While such creatures can be easily outrun, they are effective killers due to their sheer numbers and the surprise factor (it isn’t so much that Bystanders get run down as much as they turn corners and run into zombies).\n\n**Zombie Hordes:** One of the things that makes zombies so effective at killing is that they rarely hunt alone. Instead, they gather in great numbers and overwhelm an area, cutting off exits and pushing their prey into a corner in which they cannot escape.\n\n**Zombies aren’t Cannibals:** Zombies never eat each other. Even if they bump into each other, both zombies simply shamble away.\n\n**Doomed Base under Siege:** The humans have to keep the zombies from infiltrating a “safe area,” such as a country house. In many cases, the “safe area” can and will be penetrated, either through an overlooked opening (“Oh, no, they can climb!?”) or sheer force of numbers against crumbling architecture.\n\n**Just When You Least Expect It:** Most “safe areas” or breathing areas are never quite that. Zombies have a tendency to be hiding everywhere and just when you think you can relax a bit, another undead creature emerges from a closet or grabs you from behind a curtain.\n\n**Human Error:** A group of strangers are forced to work together but internal strife keeps them from working together effectively. The zombies end up exploiting these conflicts to pick apart the humans. Also, humans have a tendency to make dumb, easily avoidable mistakes that get them killed.\n\n**Dwindling Protagonists:** A group of strangers band together to defend against the zombie menace. By the end of the film, only a few (or none) remain alive.\n\n**Ineffective Humans:** Along with the protagonists are humans that need protecting and don’t carry their own weight. They are useless in a fight and don’t scavenge well.\n\n**Surprise Infection:** One of the protagonists is either unknowingly infected or chooses to hide her infection. At a dramatically appropriate point, she turns zombie and attacks her former allies.\n\n**Tragic Ending:** “Tragic” in the classical sense, zombie horror movies rarely have happy endings.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<H3\\>Smart Play**\n\nA big part of blending tropes falls on the players. In a four color superhero universe, the players can expect that their B-Listers can face their foes like opposing wrestling teams and battle it out until one side, most likely theirs, emerges the victor. In **Rotted Capes**, such tactics will only lead to a quick death or infection.\n\nSeasoned B-Listers know that the best way to survive is to have plans in place. Driving through a zombie horde in a large truck is preferable to wading in with flying fists. Baiting a super zombie through subterfuge and carefully laid traps is preferable to calling it out and facing it down like a Glory Days super-villain. Zombies are like cockroaches; if you see a few, chances are there are many more lurking about.\n\nWhile such planning is to be encouraged and does ensure a higher survival rate, the Editor-in-Chief should ensure that any plan is not 100% foolproof, especially if it relies on dwindling resources. Setting up a fire wall is great, but there are zombies that can leap the wall or are resistant to fire. Some zombies can even tunnel under a defensive line.\n\nA word of caution – players will get frustrated if you undermine their plans on a regular basis. Having the occasional special zombie tunnel under their well-thought out defenses is fine and heightens tension. Doing it every time only teaches the players that they’re wasting their time trying to play smart.\n\n**\\<H1\\>The Real Villains**\n\nZombies obviously make up the bulk of the adversaries in **Rotted Capes**, but they aren’t the only ones. Indeed, they may not even be the most dangerous ones. Remember that some of the B-Listers were villains in the Glory Days. It stands to reason that some villainous B-Listers never reformed.\n\nOn the other hand, it also stands to reason that some heroic B-Listers became villains in the zombie aftermath. Others may have simply lost hope and survive as best they can with no regard for bystanders.\n\n**Enclave Rivalries**\n\nSome enclaves will be better off than others. Some are better armed, better defended, and have more food and supplies. Others have some of these things but not all. Eventually, the scarcity of materials or hotels may lead one enclave to look at another with more than envy; the desirous enclave makes war on its neighbor.\n\nThis war may take many forms. Sometimes, a better armed enclave may make a show of force and demand that another enclave share food or supplies. The other enclave chooses either to acquiesce and give the threatening enclave what it wants or to fight so that the other enclave won’t bother them again. Some enclaves, in an effort to keep from losing Bystanders, will ask for a “contest of champions” between B-Listers.\n\n**The Revolution**\n\nAll governments have citizens that wish to change it. An autocratic leader may have a revolutionary movement promoting democracy, while a democratic government may have a revolutionary movement calling for stronger governmental powers.\n\nB-Listers may be drawn into the revolution on either side. They may be helping the Bystanders throw out a tyrant or push for better leadership, or they may be helping the Leader survive a coup from a ruthless rival. In the grand tradition of a morally gray survival scenario, the B-Listers may support a coup, only to have the new Leader turn out to be worse than the one she replaced.\n\n**The Unrepentant Super-villain**\n\nSome super-villains simply can’t change their stripes. A few become leaders of enclaves, treating their citizens like slaves, while others brave the wilderness, attacking enclaves in order to continue their crime spree. A super-villain that has a history with one or more B-Listers may be looking to settle an old score.\n\n**The Iron Leader**\n\n**\\<\\<INSERT ART** Behemoth sitting on a stone like throne with humans bowing to him. \\>\\>\n\nAs stated before, a Leader can make some unpopular decisions in the unforgiving climate of the zombie aftermath. More than a few become drunk with power and start making demands that are of dubious merit but great personal benefit. They also tend to become paranoid and see conspiracies everywhere. At least one such leader became so adamant that the enclave was working against her that she let a zombie horde in so that her enemies could be purged once and for all. Of course, that simply ended with the enclave’s destruction.\n\n**The Warlord**\n\nA variant of the iron leader, the warlord wants to unite the enclaves under a single ruler which, quite naturally, happens to be the warlord. She demands that all other enclave leaders submit to her and she commands enough firepower to eliminate smaller enclaves that refuse her. Ironically, the creation of a warlord empire does unite the various enclaves in the area, leaving the B-Listers to decide whether it is worth dismantling the empire or let the warlord continue ruling and expanding.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Sample Adventure Seeds**\n\n1\\. The Heroes must guard a group of looters as they raid a local supermarket.\n\n2\\. A traveler baits an enclave with news that a military escort is waiting to take them to a safe zone. The traveler is actually using them as bait to smoke out a zombie nest.\n\n3\\. A ruthless enclave leader’s harsh methods are proving more dangerous and lethal to the enclave than the zombies.\n\n4\\. An A-Lister returns and accepts an enclave’s hero-worship. He becomes a local “god” and starts treating Bystanders like his personal subjects.\n\n5\\. An A-Lister known to one or more B-Lister heroes returns, but she is no longer the hero they knew; the zombie aftermath has changed her.\n\n6\\. A ruthless super-villain comes to an enclave and warns the Bystanders that they are about to be attacked by a super zombie. The super-villain can lead them to a safe place. Should he be trusted?\n\n7\\. A helicopter crashes on the roof of a skyscraper in the city. Can the Heroes reach it before the zombies?\n\n8\\. A super zombie attacks the B-Listers that, in life, had knowledge they need. Can they get the creature to divulge it?\n\n9\\. A powerful super zombie sets its sight on the heroes and their bystanders. Can the heroes find and bait another super zombie to distract it?\n\n10\\. The remnants of the military want to explode a nuclear device to destroy a powerful zombie nest. Can the heroes get their enclave out of range in time?\n\n11\\. A super zombie has been attacking caravans and salvagers using rather clever tactics. Are super zombies that powerful? Has someone found a way to control zombies or is the “super zombie” simply an A-Lister masquerading as the undead?\n\n12\\. An exiled criminal bargains for admission into another enclave with the knowledge of how to get to the supplies of his original enclave. The B-Lister Leader of the new enclave decides to attack the other enclave to acquire them.\n\n13\\. A caravan broadcasts a request for help as it is surrounded by zombies. The enclave leader doesn’t want to risk her B-Listers on a rescue attempt. Should they try anyway?\n\n14\\. A superjet arrives and hovers over Paradigm City, silently remaining there for over a day. Is it friend or foe?\n\n15\\. Travelers are disappearing in a clear zone. Have the zombies returned or is something else going on?\n\n16\\. A B-Lister that the current B-Listers left for dead returns and wants payback.\n\n17\\. A few members of the Deathwatch play a dangerous game of seeing who can wait the longest before shooting a zombie and rescuing a Bystander. This leads to baiting zombies and increasing numbers of lost Bystanders.\n\n18\\. The popular leader of the enclave thinks that the B-Listers can no longer be trusted and sends them on a suicide mission. Can the B-Listers figure this out before all hope is lost? How do they deal with the leader without inciting the enclave?\n\n19\\. A larger enclave attempts to bring the B-Lister’s enclave into its mini-empire. This larger enclave has its own B-Listers, some of whom the player B-Listers respect. Should they join this larger group and what is the price for refusal?\n\n20\\. A charismatic leader brings a new religion to the enclave, offering salvation if everyone follows the same rules. Exile is suggested for even minor infractions. Although the B-Listers and the enclave government are suspicious, the new religion catches on like wildfire amongst the Bystanders. Can the B-Listers fight a faith? Do they even want to?\n\n**\\<H1\\>Enclaves**\n\nAfter Z-Day, Bystanders were either killed, became zombies, or scattered. The survivors soon learned that only by banding together did they stand a chance at survival. Such groupings of Bystanders are known as enclaves.\n\nIt’s important to note that an “enclave” is a group of Bystanders gathered together for protection; it is not a place. Because of the tenacity of zombies and the occasional super-zombie, enclaves can rarely remain in one spot for long; they are constantly on the move.\n\nEnclaves rely on B-Listers for protection. Not only do they keep zombie hordes at bay, but B-Listers also provide inspiration. It’s easier to sleep at night when your childhood superheroes, even the lesser ones, are patrolling the perimeter. B-Listers also distract super zombies that assault enclaves, holding them off long enough for the enclave to get away. Sometimes the B-Listers get lucky and destroy a super zombie.\n\nWhen creating a **Rotted Capes** campaign, you’ll first want to develop an enclave. This is the “home base” for your B-Listers. Remember that the B-Listers do not only protect the enclave; they are a part of it. This enables them to get embroiled in the daily drama amongst a group of survivors.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Enclave Size**\n\nThe definition of an enclave is rather broad; it could range from a handful of people to several hundred (the initial zombie onslaught has made larger groupings improbable). An enclave’s size has a big impact on how the enclave operates and how the B-Listers interact with them.\n\nThe smaller the enclave, the more democratic it is likely to be. A strong leader may intimidate a small group to do what she wants, but she usually lacks the ability to overrule the group. Each member has to pull her own weight in order for the enclave to survive; leeches are quickly called to account or ejected from the group. Smaller enclaves are also more mobile; they can move quickly when need be. They are also easier to maintain, a small enclave needs few resources.\n\nOn the downside, small enclaves are more vulnerable. They can’t send out small teams to forage or scout, a small group has to utilize most or all members, leaving everyone exposed to zombie surprises. Similarly, if a zombie horde attacks an enclave they are more likely to wipe it out. Even the loss of a single member can really hinder a small enclave, as there aren’t many redundancies amongst the group.\n\nLarger groups are generally more organized and, perhaps paradoxically, increasingly less democratic. Groups of Bystanders often put their faith in a single authority figure, especially if she was in a position of authority before Z-Day. Mayors, Police officers, soldiers, and even university professors have all found themselves nominated as heads of enclaves purely on their professional experiences. These new leaders often have more power granted to them then they had in their old positions and this tends to lead to an increasingly draconian government. They also have an “army” at their disposal, a paramilitary group that keeps order within and protects the enclave from zombies. As this “Deathwatch” is generally treated better than the enclave as a whole, it eagerly follows the leader’s commands, no matter how brutal.\n\nWhile not nearly as mobile as smaller groups, larger groups can put up a stronger defense, generally overcoming the need to move quickly by maintaining a Hotel for longer periods of time. Larger groups consume far more resources, but they can also field more scavenging teams at once. Larger groups also have a higher concentration of leeches; many of these are pregnant women, small children, the disabled, and the elderly, people who would have died without the support of a large enclave. Authority figures tend to find such “leeches” useful, as they are more likely to support the government and are frequently tied to potential rabble-rousers. It’s difficult to stand against a governor if your family is potentially in harm’s way.\n\nThe size of an enclave has a large impact on its relationships with B-Listers. In smaller enclaves, B-Listers are likely to have strong ties with the Bystanders; they are friends, family, and possibly even lovers. B-Listers are likely to take active roles in the enclave and are likely the only “Deathwatch” that the enclave has.\n\nIn larger enclaves, the B-Lister occupies a more familiar role, as she is protecting a town-sized group of people. B-Listers are often more aloof towards the government, allowing the leader to keep order within while they hunt zombies. This is not always the case; some B-Listers become leaders of enclaves or chief enforcers for the Deathwatch. B-Listers in large enclaves are more likely to slide into a “the group trumps the individual” mentality and may let a Bystander die if it means saving others.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Hotels**\n\nA “Hotel” is a slang term for any fortified area occupied by an enclave. Obviously, the size of the enclave determines what is feasible for a Hotel. A small enclave might establish a Hotel in a school cafeteria or a three-bedroom house; a larger enclave might establish a Hotel in a big box store or an apartment complex.\n\nNext to shelter, the first thing an enclave worries about with a Hotel is its defensibility. Windows are boarded up, unnecessary doors are sealed, and a perimeter wall is established. The make-up of the wall depends on the materials the enclave has at hand. It could be a proper wall, a fence, a piling of scrap, or simply the walls of the Hotel itself. In larger enclaves, the Deathwatch often establishes patrols and watchtowers between the wall and the Hotel.\n\nAs the Editor-in-Chief, you’ll want to sketch out the basics of the Hotel in order to determine the access points, where people sleep, where the food is kept, and the main storage areas. If the hotel has an electrical generator or broadcast tower you’ll want to note that too. You’ll also want to determine how strong the barriers and walls are and how susceptible they are to certain powers and weapons.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Defensive Plans**\n\nEvery Hotel has defensive plans in place in case of zombie attack. The longer an enclave has lived in a Hotel, the more intricate the enclave’s defensive plans will be. Some enclaves like to “segment” the Hotel, so that if zombies break into one area it can be sealed from the other areas. Bystanders are often drilled in particular roles both for defense and counterattack.\n\nThe one defensive plan every enclave has is an exit strategy. No matter how impregnable a Hotel may seem, zombies and super zombies will find some way to penetrate them. One common mistake that far too many enclaves make is to select a hotel that is almost impenetrable except for one access point. Of course, when that access point is flooded with zombies and a super zombie or phase zombies find their way in, then the entire enclave becomes sitting ducks.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Fatal Flaw**\n\nOf course, the “impregnable Hotel” is largely a myth. Almost every Hotel has unknown weaknesses that zombies are ready to exploit. A Hotel might be built atop another structure, there might be a hidden tunnel from Prohibition or the Underground Railroad, pipes or vents large enough to crawl through, especially for creatures that can’t breathe, ground that can be tunneled through, or even a container of something flammable or explosive that erupts at the wrong moment.\n\nFatal flaws often throw a monkey wrench into defensive plans, as they have not accounted for them. Fortunately, there is often more than one fatal flaw, giving the B-Listers another previously unknown escape route. At other times, their only escape route will ironically be through their best defended entrance.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**Broadcasts in the Aftermath**\n\nOne effect of a zombie holocaust is that there is little collateral damage except that which is done by those trying to stop the zombies (and the occasional super zombie). That means that satellites, cell towers, and even telephones can still operate as long as generators continue powering the equipment. In the world of Paradigm City, dedicated bunkers created in case of catastrophe (such as super-villains taking over cities, alien invasions, and the usual possible nuclear holocaust) have kept many signals broadcasting.\n\nWhat this means is that B-Listers and Bystanders with access to cell phones, smart phones, laptops, tablets, computers, and other information technologies can still use them, texting, calling, or even emailing each other. So long as they can keep their devices powered, they can use them.\n\nThings are a little different in a campy campaign. Accounts still shut off without payment and a B-Lister may need to feed a credit card number to the company on a monthly basis to keep it going (and pray it automatically reconnects after shut-off for a late payment). Unfortunately, a particular service provider’s servers were down when Z-Day hit, so B-Listers using that provider are out of luck. And those that can renew online better hope that they don’t hit their credit limit. An entire adventure could revolve around getting a provider’s server back online.\n\nThe A-Lister Night Lord apparently keeps a Twitter account running (Night[Lord@rottedcapes.com](mailto:Lord@rottedcapes.com)) and provides infrequent updates useful to survivors in the area. Enclaves share tweets and messages with each other when possible, warning each other of zombie migrations or, more importantly, of super zombies in the area. There are several websites dedicated to tracking A-Listers and B-Listers, informing the viewer of the current status of each one.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<H2\\>Caravans**\n\nCaravans are groups of Bystanders that, rather than staying in a Hotel, are roaming the outdoors. All enclaves become caravans at some point as Hotels get compromised. A caravan may be as simple as a half-dozen people walking on abandoned streets to large convoys of tractor-trailers and trucks.\n\nSecurity is a big issue with caravans, as they are constantly under threat of zombie attack. Most caravans adopt a “walled convoy approach,” keeping heavily armored vehicles on the outside of the convoy to surround more vulnerable enclave members.\n\nCaravan leaders generally have a lot of authority as there is often little time for deliberation or inaction. The Deathwatch is constantly patrolling around the caravan to ensure that zombies are spotted and dealt with before they can get close to the enclave.\n\nIf possible, caravans try to move 24/7, but logistics usually forces them to find temporary Hotels for the night. Some caravans risk sleeping outdoors. When they do, the enclave sets up a heavily patrolled perimeter and sleeps in shifts in case a sudden zombie assault sends them running.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Safe Routes**\n\nCaravans generally follow “safe routes” when possible. Safe routes are roads that limit the chance of zombie surprises. An elevated superhighway is generally a safe route, as is a road surrounded by open countryside.\n\nClear zones are also considered safe routes, although enclaves are still wary of them. Recently cleared zones are favored over older ones, as zombies tend to trickle back into clear zones relatively quickly.\n\nTraveling by boat is also considered a safe route, although large enough boats often become floating Hotels. There are many Bystanders that still own boats that are willing to move other Bystanders for a fee, usually barter of some sort.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Politics**\n\nEvery enclave has a government, an individual or several individuals that make the major decisions for the enclave. In smaller enclaves, everyone may have a stake in the government; in larger groups, the government is run by a small percentage of the enclave, making it more difficult for a Bystander to influence.\n\nAs most Bystanders understand that the enclave is necessary for survival they are ready to cede a lot of power to the leaders. What a Bystander is willing to put up with tends to be inversely proportional to the size of the enclave. In smaller enclaves a leader needs to remain popular or she can be easily replaced; in larger enclaves a rebel has to sway an overwhelming majority for change, and he wears a target on his back while doing so.\n\nGovernors of small enclaves tend to be more open to change, as new factors have a direct impact. Governors of larger enclaves, defended by the Deathwatch and masses of followers, are harder to sway and often govern through methods that, while necessary at a certain time, have long since ceased being necessary.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Leader**\n\nThe leader of an enclave often has leadership (or at least crowd control) experience in her background. She may have been a city councilor, business executive, religious leader, military officer, or teacher. Alternatively, she may simply be appointed leader due to her perceived, rather than actual, leadership experience. She may be a lawyer or medical doctor and, with the most education, was appointed leader or her duties during the Glory Days, such as working in the administrative office of a college, makes others believe she has the ability to lead.\n\nOccasionally, somebody with no previous experience or ambition becomes leader simply because he proves himself capable in the zombie aftermath. His strategies for survival so intrigue and impress an enclave that they make him leader, instantly gaining him an enemy from the previous administration.\n\nAnd, of course, there are leaders that obtained the position simply because they brought the most guns to the party. Such leaders tend to be gritty, ruthless, survivalist types who easily take over a more lenient (they would say “softer”) enclave. Such leaders are acutely aware that their position is tenuous and they impose a brutal order to ensure that such never happens.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Advisor**\n\nNo leader, from the democratically elected professor to the most ruthless dictator, truly rules alone. She is surrounded by advisors that give her support and help shape her policies. Sometimes this group is official, such as an Enclave Council; other times it’s simply the leader’s closest friends and allies.\n\nThe most important role of an advisor to a B-Lister is that she acts as an agent to the Leader. Perhaps a B-Lister knows that he can’t influence the Leader directly, but he does have a friendly relationship with the Leader’s best friend. In extreme cases, an advisor may be willing to help overthrow an evil leader if she can be prodded in the right direction; the risk is that the advisor often tips her hand in the hope of convincing their friend of the error of her ways, only to be killed or exiled as zombie food.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Deathwatch**\n\n**\\<\\<INSERT ART Death Watch\\>\\>**\n\nThe ominously named “Deathwatch” actually owes the origin of its name to the more innocuous “Neighborhood Watch,” which is exactly what the Deathwatch is, a group of people patrolling its community and keeping it free from harm. Because this group primarily looks for and eliminates zombies, it was soon tagged a “Deathwatch” and the term soon made its way through numerous enclaves.\n\nA typical Deathwatch is usually made up of the most physical members of an enclave and given the best gear. A Deathwatch member generally carries a shotgun and a slicing hand weapon, but makes do with whatever she is given. She is generally covered from head to toe in leather or other flexible, sturdy material to decrease the chance of infection.\n\nIn small enclaves, Deathwatch Commander is often the leader of the entire enclave. In larger enclaves, she is usually the leader’s right hand man, and can often effectively overrule the leader when pressed. In such cases, the Deathwatch Commander doesn’t necessarily want the leadership position and tends to check poor decisions rather than attempt to undermine the leader of the enclave.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Medical Staff**\n\nPhysicians, surgeons, and even veterinarians occupy a special place in any enclave. In the zombie aftermath they are the only people with the knowledge not only to heal the injured and sick, but also to identify early signs of infection or determine when an infection is burned out.\n\nMost enclaves are lucky enough to have one licensed medical doctor. Many enclaves make due with nurses, veterinarians, athletics trainers, or simply someone that knows how to utilize a first aid kit. A true medical doctor can be a powerful member of an enclave, as she determines whose fit to go on a patrol and who shouldn’t be let back into the enclave. She also has access to potent drugs and can, in some circumstances, incapacitate the Leader or other members of the enclave.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Engineer**\n\nJust as an enclave needs someone to keep its members healthy, it also needs someone to keep the machines running. Some enclaves are lucky enough to have a B-Lister as an engineer, a super-genius that can keep the enclave well-armed and well-protected. Most enclaves make do with auto mechanics, electricians, and IT people.\n\nAn engineer is often the source of a mission; something broke down and the engineer can’t fix it with the materials available. This could be anything from light bulbs to a car radiator. In some cases, the engineer will need access to an existing factory or garage, meaning that the B-Listers have to clean it, secure it, and keep the engineer and assistants safe while using it.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Moral Authority**\n\nA moral authority is someone whose opinion is given great weight. She may be a religious leader, former A-Lister, celebrity, or respected scholar. In smaller enclaves, a moral authority is probably part of the government but in larger enclaves it’s possible that this person has no other roll other than someone who’s consulted on big decisions and has the ability to make others share her opinions.\n\nThis is not to say that the Moral Authority holds no power. If the enclave has pledged itself to a particular religion or moral standard, then the government would take no action, whether popular or not, if the moral authority declares it wrong.\n\nThere may be multiple moral authorities in an enclave. A retired A-Lister or very experienced B-Lister may guide the actions of the current B-Listers, but have little weight amongst the enclave community as a whole. In confederate enclaves, separate moral authorities may have sway over separate groups.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Ultra**\n\nUltras were more prevalent in the early months after Z-Day but they still occasionally crop up in enclaves. An Ultra is a person who feels that his or her opinion is important and that he or she should be consulted in the major decisions of the enclave. Most Ultras end up in an enclave government or other important position. Others simply can’t understand why they aren’t taken more seriously.\n\nWhen Z-Day came, Ultras were people that presumed themselves important in the Glory Days: A-Listers, government bureaucrats and officials, business executives, religious leaders, university deans, and even popular entertainers. Some of these Ultras continue to have impacts in enclaves even now. Many Ultras have also sprung up in the zombie aftermath: survivalists, hunters, family patriarchs and matriarchs, and B-Listers.\n\nWhat makes Ultras important is their ability to sway votes and determine courses of action. Even a disrespected Ultra can still bark, ensuring that she either browbeats others into joining her or encouraging others to quickly vote against whatever she wants. It’s valuable to know who the Ultras that hold sway are in your enclave and get them on your side as quickly as possible.\n\n**\\<h3\\>B-Lister**\n\nB-Listers occupy a unique place within an enclave. They are at times considered an extension of the Deathwatch and are at other times Advisors to the Leader. In some cases a B-Lister may be Medical Staff (especially if he has the Healing power) or even the Leader. B-Listers are often treated differently than Bystanders and are generally autonomous to Enclave Laws.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Lone Wolf**\n\nFor whatever reason, there are some people that simply feel better when apart from others, even if it means sharing countryside with zombies. Lone wolves enjoy the open road and travel from enclave to enclave, rarely staying in one place for too long. Some lone wolves have lost a lot and fear putting roots in a place just to have them ripped out again. Others were rugged outdoorsmen who still enjoy being outdoors; these types sometimes stay with an enclave as long as they are frequently given loot team assignments. Lone Wolf B-Listers are often known as “Ronin,” as they wander the zombie wastelands helping travelling Bystanders, loot teams, and the occasional enclave.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Types of Government**\n\nThere is a wide diversity of governments within enclaves. Some enclaves follow the will of a single leader, while others are far more democratic. Detailed here are some of the most common types of enclave governments.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Consensus**\n\nConsensus governments only usually work with very small enclaves. Everyone has an equal say and the enclave only acts when everyone agrees. Leaders may set the agenda but are limited to consensus decision-making. The danger with consensus governments is that an enclave may refuse to act without consulting every member, even if a member or two aren’t present. Consensus governments are usually short-term governments that quickly evolve into democracies.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Democratic**\n\nDemocratic governments are also represented more amongst small enclaves. Every member of the enclave votes on every important matter and the majority rules. Leaders of democracies have more power than a consensus government and usually try to interpret votes liberally so as to not require them frequently. An effective leader works to ensure that she has at least 51% of the enclave supporting her.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Representative**\n\nLarge enclaves that want to hold on to the ideals of democracies tend to have representative governments; one person represents a part of the enclave. Representative governments may also be born out of non-democratic enclaves – an enclave made up of several families may simply have the heads of each family gather to make decisions. Rather than sway a majority of the enclave, someone wishing to affect a representative government need only poison the ears of a few people.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Confederation**\n\nA confederation is less a single enclave as it is a group of mini-enclaves that band together for mutual protection and survival. Each distinct group within a confederation may have its own way of doing things; a democratic and theocratic mini-enclave may be part of the same overall enclave. Each group designates its own leader(s) to represent its interest in the confederate government, but the actual authority of this government is small and usually requires consensus (otherwise, the minority groups would simply leave). Confederations are difficult to control; attempts by an ambitious leader to unite them often fracture the Confederation instead.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Theocratic**\n\nA theocratic government follows an ideal. This may be theocratic in the traditional sense of a particular religion, but it could also be the ideals of a nation, popular figure, or even an A-Lister. Theocratic leaders tend to wield a lot of power and can scare enclave citizens into submission by merely suggesting that they are straying from the true path. Of course, this works against the Leader as well, especially if his “prophecies” have a way of not coming true.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Military**\n\nA military government is one where the higher ranked members of an enclave make decisions for lower ranked members. This could be a true military organization, such as the remnants of an army division, or it could be any group with merit-based levels. In any case, a military government usually establishes a method to “move up the ranks,” giving all members of an enclave a chance for advancement if they prove themselves worthy. Unfortunately, those at the bottom, which usually comprise the largest group, are often treated poorly.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Authoritarian**\n\nAn authoritarian government follows the rule of a self-appointed Leader or circle of Leaders. While the classic authoritarian government is the rule of an iron-fisted dictator, an authoritarian leader could be benevolent as well. A small enclave may simply follow the lead of a former mayor or police sergeant because they see them as authority figures and such Leaders rarely abuse their powers. On the other hand, a ruthless dictator needs to convince the enclave that living under his rule is better than taking one’s chances with zombies.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Anarchy**\n\nNot all enclaves, especially newly created ones, have a stable government; they are just a collection of frightened people that have massed together for lack of better plans. In this case the B-Listers are going to have to help establish some sort of order while keeping various Bystanders from harming themselves or the entire enclave. Most authoritarian Leaders grab their power from just these circumstances.\n\nAnarchy can also reign when an enclave loses faith in its government. Perhaps the Leader was toppled or the deliverance that the theocratic leader promised never came to pass. In any case, the enclave devolves into anarchy and, again, the B-Listers are called upon to maintain order along with the remnants of the Deathwatch.\n\n**\\<H2\\>The Laws of the Enclave**\n\nEvery enclave enforces certain rules in order to keep the group together and be as safe as possible. These laws may be based on laws from the Glory Days or they may simply be rules developed through trial and error in the zombie aftermath.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Laws of Welcome**\n\nThe Laws of Welcome are simply the protocol an enclave uses when confronted by a traveler. They involve how close a traveler is allowed to come before he can speak, what weapons he’s allowed to possess when entering, and ways he can prove he is not a zombie. The most xenophobic enclaves often require an unknown traveler to strip naked and spin around so he can be inspected for infection (ironically, several travelers that stripped naked were literally caught with their pants down when a zombie rushed them from a concealed area).\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Laws of Property**\n\nThe Laws of Property simply state what each member of the enclave is allowed to own and what is considered communal property. This can be important to travelers with horses or vehicles, as joining an enclave, even for a night, could mean the loss of their property. The Laws of Property also extends to food; some enclaves allow Bystanders to hoard their own food supplies; others insist that all food be centrally located and doled out as necessary.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Laws of Government**\n\nAssuming that the Leader isn’t a total autocrat, there are rules for electing leaders and giving them authority. Most enclaves have regular meetings, whether it is a strong leader and her advisors or a meeting of family heads. Who can approach the government and how she can address her concerns is often written into the code. Theoretically, most enclaves have rules for removing leaders, but for obvious reasons these are rarely enforced.\n\nThe Deathwatch’s authority is also covered under this section, although in practice the Deathwatch usually has as much authority as it wishes to exercise. Still, most Deathwatch members try to follow the law, making sure that they have orders from the Commander before violating any of them.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Criminal Code**\n\nEvery enclave needs a method of dealing with criminals, whether they hoard food, steal supplies, or threaten other Bystanders. Depending on the enclave this could be very informal, such as an autocratic leader that holds court and makes verdicts based on what she feels is right, or the enclave may have an elaborate legal system, complete with lawyers, judges, and a right to appeal.\n\nThanks to modern technology, enclave criminal codes can be just as weighty as the originals, assuming the batteries and power holds out. Alternatively, some enclaves might have more primitive systems, including trial by combat or very bright-line, liberally interpreted laws (i.e. “if you are caught stealing, you get beheaded and your body burned”).\n\nThe Criminal Code often conflicts with B-Lister justice and is the source of contention for many enclaves. Most B-Listers want to give wrong-doers a second chance, while Leaders are more concerned about the health of the enclave as a whole. It’s also difficult to apply the Criminal Code to B-Listers without another B-Lister to enforce it, or even to apply the Code to a Bystander if the B-Lister is willing to protect him against it.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial punishment in any enclave is exile. B-Listers generally insist on it, while Leaders worry that they are feeding the local zombie population. Leaders would rather execute criminals than risk it, especially when large numbers of criminals need to be dealt with at once. Some enclaves have created a special punishment called “Absorption,” where a B-Lister can vouch for a criminal’s future compliance with enclave law. Should the criminal commit another crime, then the Leader can impose punishments against the B-Lister or her loved ones.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Loot Teams**\n\nEvery enclave needs loot teams, people that can go out and return with supplies the enclave needs. Established enclaves often have rules for how many people can make up a loot team, what their roles are on the team, and what to do in case of zombie attack. In many cases these rules also spell out when it’s okay to leave someone behind.\n\n**\\<h2\\>Entertainment**\n\nWhile most of the daily routines are geared towards survival, enclave governments do realize the necessity of allowing its members to blow off steam and to forget about their troubles for a while. A variety of entertainments are allowed and encouraged. Some enclaves are fortunate enough to have entertainers amongst them that perform new versions of old routines. Other enclaves simply show old movies and television shows.\n\nAmongst the Bystanders, sports and other games are popular. All of the traditional sports, such as football (both types), baseball, basketball, and even hockey, are represented, with their rules altered for playing in available space. Children still jump rope and skateboard, while adults play poker and other party games.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Blood Sports**\n\nIt may seem ironic that in a world where zombies are constantly attacking you that you’d create games where humans can hurt each other, but the few remaining psychiatrists maintain that there is something in the human psyche that wants to prove that it can still dominate other beings, whether living or undead.\n\nMost “blood sports” are simply regular sports with fewer rules. Playing American Football without pads (similar to rugby) is a popular one, but mixed martial arts competitions help competitors stay in shape to fight the zombies. Prizes are often more perks or supplies.\n\n**\\<h2\\>Agriculture**\n\nOne of the first things Bystanders noticed when observing zombies is just how uninterested they are in vegetables. A zombie walking through a garden does no more damage than a drunkard trying to make his way home. In theory, an entire field can be planted and harvested without fear of zombies destroying it. In practice, it is very dangerous for farmers to return to the same spot, usually outside the confines of the enclave, to work the land.\n\n**\\<h2\\>Exile**\n\nIf an enclave has an exile punishment then it often has a particular procedure for preparing criminals for it. An exile sentence could be the focus of an entire issue or even a multi-issue arc (or mini-series). Exile is either humane or cowardly depending on one’s perspective; you are releasing someone into the wilderness who’s probably going to end up becoming a zombie.\n\nExile is more common in camp series, where the harsh realities of survival are less of a factor. Even in the zombie aftermath, news travels fast and an exile isn’t likely to be welcomed in surrounding enclaves, which leaves them exposed to roaming zombies. Still, even in gritty series, exile may serve a purpose other than removal (which is better served through execution) that makes it a viable punishment.\n\nSome punishments are temporary exiles; the criminal is allowed to return once certain conditions are met. The exile may be expected to kill a number of zombies, hunt a super zombie, or retrieve something that was lost in the city. Alternatively, the exile may have a finite amount of time, after which the criminal may return to the enclave.\n\nPermanent exiles are more extreme; the criminal will never be allowed back into the enclave. This often dooms the criminal to death or infection, as she needs to spend a long time surviving on her own before she can find a new enclave. Some enclaves make the punishment worse by marking the criminal in some way in order to broadcast her status. Such marks can be hidden but, if discovered after the criminal is accepted into a new enclave, immediately makes her a suspect of any crime that occurred since she joined.\n\nWhen handing down a sentence of exile, an enclave court has to determine the process of exile. Criminals are usually driven a certain distance and dropped off. Usually, the criminal is often given some supplies to ease her transition to the wilderness, especially if the sentence is temporary. Paranoid enclaves often drop off the criminal and the supplies in different spots so that the criminal can’t use any weapons against her transporters; most transporters keep at least one gun trained on the criminal at all times to ensure a smooth start of sentence. In gritty series, most exiled criminals, once retrieving their weapons, commit suicide rather than risk the zombies.\n\nGritty series also have a high incidence of “poaching.” Regardless of the sentence, some exiled criminals aren’t trusted and a vigilante group of Bystanders secretly follows the transporters and ensures that the criminal won’t cause any more trouble by killing her. In some enclaves this “vigilante group” is actually the Deathwatch, who has turned the sentence into a sport. After all, what should the enclave care what happens to a permanent exile?\n\nNeedless to say, authoritarian enclave leaders often use the exile punishment to get rid of political rivals and threats to their power. Exile is preferable to execution because it avoids martyrdom while still effectively imposing the same punishment. Allies of the exile are likely to take comfort in the possibility that the exile survives rather than openly rebel, giving the leader more time to root them out.\n\n**\\<H1\\>Drama**\n\n**\\<\\<INSERT** ART – Spider Man cover of Spiderman in mourning, but instead have it be Balor with a female dead behind him. \\>\\>\n\nIn the Glory Days, heroes didn’t simply don costumes and fight bad guys. They also had complex private lives with their own trials and tribulations and, oftentimes, these private entanglements would affect the hero’s performance in battle. Similarly, in the zombie aftermath, heroes are more than just bashers of zombies; they also have personal interactions within their chosen enclave.\n\nThe drama of life in an enclave can certainly affect the missions outside it. A B-Lister in a love triangle may openly wonder whether her rival is assigning her to dangerous missions in order to be rid of her. A B-Lister whose brother was just infected prior to the B-Lister leaving to rout the nest doesn’t know whether his brother was saved or turned or how bad the burns will be. He also has to worry about a Bystander shooting his brother “just to be sure.”\n\nDrama can add a lot of roleplaying opportunities in the zombie aftermath and really helps the game be more than just a “zombie dungeon crawl” (although there is certainly nothing wrong with that play style if that’s what your group wants to play). Entire issues could revolve around the drama inside an enclave rather than the threats from without.\n\n**\\<h2\\>Flashbacks**\n\nUnless you began your series as a regular four-color superhero series and then dropped Z-Day, chances are your players only know their B-Listers and pool of Bystanders (to say nothing of super zombies) as they are now, rather than as they were. While you can certainly deal with this through a line of explanation, (“Here comes Awesome Man. He’s now a super zombie, but you remember him as a real boy scout in the Glory Days”), there is a meatier alternative: the Flashback scene.\n\nFlashbacks allow you to introduce characters as they were before heavily roleplaying them as they are. This offers the players a window into the life of the character during the Glory Days and provides hooks for their B-Listers to interact with the character now. You can even introduce previous drama into the flashback scene for the B-Lister to deal with in the present.\n\nFlashbacks are a good way to draw contrasts between the Glory Days and the zombie aftermath. The Paradigm City of old was bright and safe, while it’s currently a giant zombie nest. The relative importance of major characters could be contrasted, often without the players knowing who the important person is in the flashback scene.\n\nFor example, the Editor-in-Chief may start a session with a flashback to a corporate office, where an executive is pitching a corporate sponsorship to a B-Lister. During the course of the conversation, a sanitation worker walks in to empty the trash. The executive berates him for interrupting a closed door meeting and the worker apologizes and leaves.\n\nIn the present, that corporate executive is now one of many looters caught in a zombie-covered area. While the B-Listers try to clear it out, they are aided by a hardened survivalist. The B-Lister in the flashback recognizes the survivalist as that sanitation worker, and the survivalist mentions he was fired that day. He finds it very interesting to be in a position to help that former executive now.\n\n**\\<h2\\>The Bridge**\n\nA bridge is the “scene sweep” that takes the B-Listers from the present into the Glory Days. If you’re using Paradigm City then it should be relatively easy for you to select a location and introduce a scene. While not necessary, you should also try to involve as many other players as possible. Perhaps the B-Listers were known to each other before Z-Day; they may have even formed a “Junior Protector Corps.”\n\nThe scene should be something relevant to the current situation. If you’re introducing the B-Lister as a reformed villain looking for an enclave, flash back to a scene where he was thoroughly enjoying being the villain, perhaps doing things that aren’t easy to forgive. If the newcomer was an old flame, flash back to a dinner scene where the B-Lister and his old flame were madly in love with each other and one signaled undying love (a marriage proposal, finally ditching a rival, changing one’s career plans, etc).\n\n**\\<h2\\>The Objective**\n\nEvery flashback scene should also have an objective. The Editor-in-Chief needs to ask herself “what do I hope to accomplish with this scene?” If you are running this solo for a B-Lister then you need to get to that objective quickly; if all are involved then you can take more time.\n\nBe wary of the trap of letting a flashback get away from you. If the villain was dastardly don’t give hints of softness. If the two ex-lovers were supposed to be madly in love don’t highlight potential problems. You don’t want to telegraph expectations or sabotage the impact. A poorly worded jab could turn a B-Lister against a Bystander even if the rest of the scene portrays her sympathetically.\n\n**\\<h2\\>Resolving Conflicts**\n\nMore so than any other scene, flashbacks work best when the dice stay out of the player’s hands. While the Editor-in-Chief should certainly leave room for improvisation, the core element of the flashback is predetermined. Even if the flashback is left open (i.e. the Editor-in-Chief establishes that the B-Lister and the super-villain once met, but how that situation was resolved is unimportant to the fact that they are meeting now), there’s always a chance that a cross word or fist-fight could lead to death. In an even tighter flashback it doesn’t take much for a bad series of rolls to send the flashback off in the wrong direction, leaving it to Editor-in-Chief editing (also known as fiat) to reign in the scene.\n\nAs a rule, players tend to be generally comfortable with the scripted aspects of a flashback as it’s simply a more fun and interactive way to convey information that would otherwise be monologue. Still, a good Editor-in-Chief can make the events of the flashback flow naturally, leading to passive acceptance rather than active resistance.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**The Bait-and-Switch**\n\nOne interesting way to play **Rotted Capes** is to start with a few issues (maybe even a miniseries) showcasing life before Z-Day. The B-Listers have no idea that their world is about to end and this is the perfect opportunity for Editors-in-Chief to introduce A-Listers, B-Listers, and Bystanders that she plans to re-introduce once Z-Day arrives.\n\nThis is also an opportunity to showcase characters that were important in the B-Lister’s life before Z-Day and resulting aftermath that destroyed it. Perhaps the lone wolf B-Lister was once a family man and Z-Day took all of that away from him. It makes for an interesting juxtaposition to have the other players see how this B-Lister was before his personality was completely rearranged by the effects of the zombie apocalypse.\n\nAnother twist is to allow the players to primarily portray the A-Listers that influenced their future B-Lister heroes. While these A-Listers won’t survive the Z-Day, they can certainly provide life lessons and teachable moments to their protégés. Perhaps, while attached to them, the B-Lister sidekicks don’t really want to turn out to be like their A-Lister mentors.\n\nOne final note of caution: in spite of the heading of this sidebar, you may not want to surprise your players with a true bait-and-switch (i.e. pitching a typical superhero series to them and then yanking out the rug after a few issues to throw them into a zombie apocalypse). You run the risk of sapping enthusiasm from your players, even if they would normally be receptive to a **Rotted Capes** series.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<h2\\>Relationships**\n\nAll B-Listers should have relationships with at least some people within the enclave. Not only does this allow the B-Lister to have people to interact with, but these people also have their own trials and tribulations that the B-Lister will also get caught up in. The following are several examples of relationships a B-Lister may start the game with.\n\nRemember that relationships are fluid, and a lover today could become a friend or enemy later in the series.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Family**\n\nWhen Z-Day arrived, one’s natural instinct is to protect one’s family. This could be a single individual, such as a son or grandmother, or it could be an entire extended family (usually minus a few unfortunate members). Most commonly, it’s a handful of surviving members of the B-Lister’s immediate family still mourning the loss of a few less fortunate members. In some cases the family may be adopted after the chaos of Z-Day (a B-Lister takes the child of a doomed friend under her wing or she adopts a recent orphan).\n\n**\\<h3\\>Lover**\n\nThe B-Lister’s lover is part of the enclave. Whether married before Z-Day or simply in a serious relationship, they are dedicated to each other. A common trope is the ex-lovers brought back together via the zombie aftermath; they still may have issues that need working out.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Bestie (or BFF)**\n\nWhile you may have friends within the enclave, your Bestie is like a sibling. The two of you are always looking out for each other and it’s inconceivable that your Bestie would ever betray you. When a B-Lister goes off on a zombie hunt, it’s her Bestie that she trusts to watch over her loved ones.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Frenemy**\n\nA frenemy is like a Bystander with the first stage of a zombie infection; she pretends to be your best friend and then works to undermine you. This may not be a one-way street; two rivals for the same lover may be mutual frenemies. When a B-Lister leaves the enclave, it’s his frenemy he worries about staying behind.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Mentor**\n\nPeople still need teachers in the zombie apocalypse. Your mentor may excel in a certain skill, or she may be a former A-Lister whose injuries have left her incapable of fighting evil the way she used to. Your mentor generally keeps you on the straight and narrow, although it’s possible that your mentor is an ex-super-villain or deranged professor that pushes you to be more ruthless in your actions.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Fan**\n\nThis person had your poster on his wall when you were still a sidekick. A fan always seeks to help a B-Lister, whether wanted or not. He knows everything about the B-Lister’s history and probably maintained an extensive website on the B-Lister before the Z-Day. If he still has access to the net then he continues his updates; otherwise he keeps meticulous notes in a journal until he gets the chance to update his site.\n\n**\\<\\<INSERT ART - Preteen girl dressed up like Templar with knife in hand\\>\\>**\n\n**\\<h3\\>Sidekick**\n\nYou may have been a sidekick before Z-Day, but to those you protect you are an A-Lister now, and an A-Lister needs a sidekick. Unfortunately, potential sidekicks these days tend to have even less power than you do. Still, the Sidekick creates a costume modeled on yours and begs to be taken on missions with you. Hopefully, he has some skills that are useful to you.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Rival**\n\nMaybe you were on opposite sides of the hero/villain dynamic before Z-Day, or you were just two heroes (or villains) that didn’t get along. Now both of you have to help the enclave if either of you are going to survive. Unlike Frenemies, though, you don’t even pretend to get along with each other and each of you never misses an opportunity to dump on the other. Still, when the going gets tough you still grudgingly work together.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Dependent**\n\nYou have someone that is clearly dependent on you. It may be a child or elderly relative; it may be someone that is mentally or physically impaired, or it may be someone that’s just particularly vulnerable. Whoever it is, you can’t be away from them for long periods of time. They may also be the reason why you stick with an enclave rather than strike out on your own.\n\n**\\<H2\\>Issues**\n\nWhat fun would relationships be without issues (we’re talking about relationship issues here, not an issue of a **Rotted Capes** series)? Issues are the subplots and complications that a B-Lister has to deal with based on his relationships with others in the enclave. Sometimes these issues also crop up with previously unattached members of an enclave.\n\nRemember that issues aren’t exclusive. Many of the issues below (and any others that you concoct) can be woven together into interesting dramatic scenes. Imagine, for example, if a rival with an old score to settle killed the infected loved one of the B-Lister.\n\nHere are a few examples of issues. Doubtless the Editor-in-Chief will think of many more.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**There are no Teenagers**\n\nNo, this heading does not imply that the zombie hordes have wiped out everyone over twelve and under twenty. Instead, it implies that in a world where survival is a daily challenge, there is no room for a teenage subculture. When children are old enough to wield weapons and have children of their own, they are considered adults.\n\nIn effect, it’s a return to a medieval mindset and, in keeping with that analogy, provides plenty of drama with leaders making brash and immature decisions. Many “young adults” will soon find themselves in key positions as older people tend not to live as long, get maimed, or turned. Unfortunately, the loss of the teenage label does not erase the teenage mind and petty disputes, infatuations, and other dramatic situations can explode into melodrama fairly easily. The teenage mind just isn’t equipped to handle pragmatism as well as an experienced adult can.\n\nFor B-Listers, this can make for interesting situations, especially if the B-Listers are teenagers themselves. How does a B-Lister handle unwanted infatuation from a teenage leader that has an entire Deathwatch behind him? How can an enclave negotiate with teenage leaders that declare war whenever they don’t get what they want?\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**\\<h3\\>We could have saved her!**\n\nIn the chaos of Z-Day and the immediate aftermath, little was known about the zombie infection and the fact that, at least in its initial stages, it’s treatable. Many B-Listers and Bystanders put infected people to death when they could have potentially been saved. Doing so to someone you don’t know is bad enough, but imagine if it was a loved one. Worse (if such a word can be used), other loved ones know you did it.\n\nThis gets even more complicated in the present, where purification is a known cure. Did you really need to kill your infected frenemy, or were you just taking the opportunity of ridding yourself of a problem?\n\n**\\<h3\\>How could you do it?**\n\nEven with the knowledge that the deed must be done, many Bystanders look upon B-Listers with suspicion if they put down their own loved ones. Is it right for you to do so, or should you leave that to another? How can you cope with a Bestie that killed your zombie spouse, even if you asked her to do it?\n\nThis is especially effective in family relationships, where the B-Lister killed a zombie family member and the rest of the family knows it. Will your children still trust you after you killed their older brother, even if he was after their brains at the time? How does your sister’s widower look at you after you slaughtered what was left of his wife?\n\n**\\<h3\\>Loose Cannon**\n\nOne of your friends or loved ones is a loose cannon; she’s constantly getting herself into trouble. She may freak out and blindly run away at the hint of a zombie, he may think that he knows a lot about survival when he clearly doesn’t, or she speaks before thinking and causes trouble. In any event, the B-Lister often gets drawn into the situation when the loose cannon, well, runs loose.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Love Triangle**\n\nEven when struggling to survive on a daily basis, people are human and generally desire companionship. Unfortunately, pickings can be slim in an enclave, especially if the gender you are attracted to is underrepresented. Thus, many enclave members find themselves in love triangles.\n\nThe classic love triangle is two people being in love with a third person who loves them both back. This third person often doesn’t push one of them away (otherwise that person becomes **The Stalker**), leaving both to believe they have a chance at companionship. Things are even more complicated in the zombie aftermath, as many people try not to get to exclusive or close to people that might be zombies or dead a few days from now.\n\nFinally, a love triangle need not be romantic. A family member reliant on a particular Bystander may not appreciate the attention he is getting from another Bystander and actively work against her. A fellow B-Lister may believe that taking a lover is a bad thing and encourage her ally to break it off with hers (he may even try to sabotage the relationship as “proof” that they can’t work).\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Replacement**\n\nWith people constantly dying in the zombie aftermath there’s always room for someone to step into the shoes of another. A Bystander may become a surrogate spouse and parent, the Deathwatch may get a new commander, and a new B-Lister may replace a beloved one that was cut down two weeks ago.\n\nIssues revolve around how favorably the replacement compares to the original and whether the replacement is accepted or desired in the first place. The Replacement may inadvertently continue a love triangle that was thought to be ended with the original’s death, or he may be a B-Lister with powers and ethics seen as inferior to the B-Lister he replaced.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Stalker**\n\nThe stalker is a Bystander or B-Lister that keeps inserting herself into someone’s life unwanted. This could be relatively innocuous, like a young Bystander that always wants to talk to a B-Lister when she returns from a mission, or it could be creepy and dangerous, like a man that continually makes unwanted advances towards a woman and interferes with anyone else that tries to court her.\n\nAn interesting wrinkle to add with a stalker is to make him crucial to the survival of the enclave. Maybe the Bystander grits her teeth and bears it when the stalker lavishes attention on her because he’s the only medical doctor in the enclave. Maybe the stalker is a B-Lister and his loss would significantly weaken the enclave’s defenses.\n\nWhatever the case, anyone that the stalker perceives to be an obstacle had better watch his back. The stalker normally has no qualms letting such people wander into zombie nests or catch an unfortunate bullet in the back.\n\n**\\<h3\\>I’m Back!**\n\nIn the chaos of the zombie aftermath many people get lost and presumed dead, only to turn up at a later date. Some may have survived on their own, while others joined different enclaves. In any case, the loved one is presumed dead and the Bystander moves on with his life – and then she returns.\n\nThe return of a loved one can cause many complications, especially if there’s a replacement or other suitor involved. Even with Z-Day only being about a year in the past, there’s still plenty of time for Bystanders to take new lovers and even start raising families, only for the original spouse returning as if from the dead. Some returning Bystanders are welcomed with open arms while others receive a chillier welcome. The returning Bystander may even have her own emotional baggage. Why did they leave her behind so easily? Why didn’t they send messages to the other enclaves? Can she expect her old flame to pick up where they left off?\n\nAn interesting spin on this is when two separated lovers presume the other dead and each move on. What happens when two enclaves merge and the two discover that they both survived, except now they each have families of their own? How do their children react? How do the families get along with each other?\n\nA superhero twist on this angle is to have an A-Lister (or even B-Lister) that was presumed dead suddenly pop up. This hero treats the current B-Listers as they were in the Glory Days and expects them to suddenly submit to her orders. She may not like or accept what the B-Listers have become and actively try to get them to return to their former ways. This could be very difficult if the current B-Lister was a villain in the Glory Days and the returning A-Lister just can’t bring herself to believe it.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Glory Days Still**\n\nPerhaps as a coping mechanism or other psychological reason, some people refuse to see the world as it is. They constantly reference the Glory Days and act as if they are still here. In mild cases, the Bystander merely wants relationships and, to a certain extent, lifestyles, to remain the same, while in more extreme cases the Bystander actually believes that the Glory Days are still here. He patiently waits for his wife to come home from work, even though she’d been eaten by a zombie six months ago.\n\nA variant of this is the Gamer, who escapes from the reality of the zombie aftermath through online MMORPGs that are still functioning, behaves as if he is a toon seeing the world through its eyes, or simply huddles in the corner with a few friends and spends the majority of his time playing **Arcanis**.\n\nThis symptom can have a great impact when other people in the “Gloria’s” life have changed, yet the Gloria refuses to accept it. He plays the dutiful husband even after his wife has moved on and is seeing someone else. He treats his daughter like the princess she was, not the battle-hardened zombie slayer she is.\n\nA superhero twist on this trope is the hero that continues acting according to his Glory Days code. He still acts as if he is protecting the citizens of a city, sees super zombies as any other super-villain nemesis, and refuses to believe that a super-villain could have a change of heart just because of some Z-Day.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Settling an Old Score**\n\nThis issue comes into play when something unresolved between two or more people during the Glory Days comes into play in the zombie aftermath. Two B-Listers may have been personal enemies now forced to work together (bonus points if one of them was responsible for the death of a loved one or teammate during the Glory Days). One B-Lister may have taken credit for something that another B-Lister accomplished, and with the A-Listers gone there’s no way to rectify it.\n\nNor does this issue need be limited to B-Listers. Bystanders could have old scores to settle as well, such as an executive that was stepped on for a promotion, a criminal that had been put away by a police officer, or even two soldiers (uniformed or unconventional) from different sides of a war that took place toward the end of the Glory Days.\n\nIn any case the unsettled score still simmers and both sides desperately try to find some way to end it, either through finally besting the other or trying, but failing, to put the past behind them.\n\n**\\<h3\\>In Memoriam**\n\nA B-Lister is trying hard to live up to the ideals of a favorite A-Lister; she may even have taken on his mantle. While no one usually mistakes her for the original, they do question her whenever she does something that her predecessor would never do (never mind that the Glory Days and the zombie aftermath are two different worlds that play by different rules).\n\nOccasionally, a roaming Bystander does mistake her for the original and tries to settle an old score or rebuild a relationship. Even when the truth is revealed, the affected Bystander sometimes projects his feelings for the old hero onto the new, causing lots of complications.\n\n**\\<h3\\>But I’m a Hero!**\n\nAs we’ve said before, the Glory Days and the zombie apocalypse are two different worlds. Unfortunately, the circumstances of the new world often make the B-Lister deal with uncomfortable decisions. Many of these have already been covered, but it’s worth noting here that sometimes the decisions of the leaders of an enclave won’t sit well with a B-Lister and she’ll have to struggle with whether she can support the government in protecting the enclave or whether it’s gone too far.\n\nUnfortunately, a B-Lister often tips her hand by expressing concern about a government’s methods. This encourages the leader to have the Deathwatch keep an eye on the B-Lister as the Leader gathers information useful to either keep the B-Lister in line or at least keep her from disrupting the enclave, with prejudice if necessary.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Burn Victim**\n\n\\<\\<INSERT ART - A Hero on the ground with arm exposed showing a bite mark and Liberty Torch’s torch about to burn him/her. \\>\\>\n\nThe only way to combat infection is to burn it off. Obviously, this leaves physical scars. One of the reasons B-Listers maintain costumes is to preserve their image as clean heroes, not horribly scarred survivors. Only B-Listers fortunate enough to have the Healing and Regeneration powers on their side can make these marks disappear.\n\nExtensive scarring can take an emotional toll. B-Listers that have needed the purification several times start to resemble the zombies they hunt. An attractive Bystander used to having women fall all over him might have to deal with a horribly scarred face.\n\nAlternatively, a burn victim may be able to masquerade as someone else, especially if it’s been some time since that person was last seen. It’s more difficult to pull this off with current technology, but most enclaves won’t have access to the latest and greatest and, unless a Bystander put her images and video on a remote server or the smart phone she still carries, then the images may be inaccessible. On the flip side, a burn victim may have difficulty convincing an enclave that she’s still the same person they lost six months ago, especially if they have contradictory evidence.\n\n**\\<h3\\>The Quest**\n\nWith this issue a B-Lister or Bystander becomes so focused and single-minded on a particular goal that it trumps everything else. The obvious quest is zombie hunting, but it could also be the search for Sanctuary, a lost piece of super equipment, or even the desire to lead the enclave.\n\nQuesters tend to ignore whatever else is going on around them. A Quester, for instance, may not even realize that she is in a love triangle; she believes that her significant other patiently waits for her in the enclave as she spends most of her days trying to find a particular super zombie. Instead, her ignored lover is busy being courted by someone else.\n\nQuesters get dangerous when the object of their quest is in sight. They are often willing to sacrifice anything, including themselves to obtain it.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Becoming the Monster**\n\nNot only has the world changed after Z-Day, but the B-Lister or Bystander is changing with it. This change goes beyond getting into “survival mode,” the B-Lister is slowly losing his humanity. He protects the enclave because it’s his job, and he hunts zombies because it’s his job.\n\nA Leader may enforce rigid rules in the name of survival, but she ends up treating the enclave as chattel more than people. A B-Lister may still rescue Bystanders trapped by a zombie horde, but he doesn’t worry about the Bystander that wandered off in the wrong direction. Loved ones find the B-Lister detached from them, and fellow B-Listers are noticing that he’s going increasingly Lone Wolf on them.\n\nLike a Quester, B-Listers slowly becoming monsters often don’t realize what they are doing to their loved ones before it’s too late. Unlike Questers, however, a B-Lister losing her humanity is dangerous. She may confront her rival and beat her to a pulp; she may simply remove herself further from humanity. Most such B-Listers soon come to the realization that there’s nothing worth living for and embrace death, going out in one last blaze of glory.\n\n\\<sidebar\\>\n\n**The Loss of Humanity**\n\nFear, self-preservation, and apathy (among other emotions) can have a grave impact on one’s psyche. A perky, naïve student from the Glory Days could become a ruthless zombie hunter within the span of a few months. Two siblings that were tight could easily start distrusting each other to the point where they are at each other’s throats. Old rivalries that would have been minor bumps in the road of life now become things worth killing for.\n\nOne way to drive home the harshness of life in an enclave is to show the slow descent of Bystanders during the course of a series. Perhaps an idealistic medical doctor becomes more fatalistic as the weeks wear on. The impact is even worse with children, who are forced to grow up quickly. Many Bystanders can’t handle it and nary has a week gone by without someone ending his life with a bullet or a noose.\n\nOn the other hand, there are always a few flecks of hope. Perhaps a hot-headed, narcissistic dilettante becomes more caring and appreciative of other people over time. Perhaps a priest that has lost her faith slowly gains it back. Perhaps a B-Lister that never felt very important has a chance to truly shine.\n\n\\</sidebar\\>\n\n**Zombie Code Authority**\n\n1.  Yellow is bad. (Reference to the infectious blotches)\n2.

Below, we will delve into the various types of threats you can throw at your heroes.   \n  \nYou may notice that many of the threats found in the following pages have a budget that is either more or less than their build budget. That’s fine; if you are creating your threats, don’t feel straitjacketed by your build budget, but don’t go overboard. It's all a balancing act.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Types of Threats post Z’day\n\n**Animals:**\n\nDuring the collapse, animal rights activists, led by a superpowered group known as the Wyld Pack, broke into every zoo, lab, and nature preserve they could find, releasing the animals within. Now, years later, these animals have flourished, using their heightened senses to avoid roaming zombie hordes. A lion pride living in the suburbs, packs of wild dogs roam cities, while a troop of silverback apes settle into an old farm. Interestingly, no known cases of Z’d animals have appeared; however, there are reports of animal Abominations.\n\n**Survivors: Allies & Adversaries**\n\nThere are two different categories of survivors. Bystanders are everyday people trying to cope with this new reality, but where they commonly lack combat skills, they make up for it with the will to live. Then we have hardened survivors, many are ex-military or law enforcement or bystanders that over time have improved their skills and sharpened their instincts.\n\n**  \nAbominations:**\n\nMutants were a thing before Z’day, but always the result of gen-splicing experimentation by villains, disreputable organizations, and governments. With very few exceptions, these mutants were a lot like the monstrosities we see today. Today, they are much more common; these unfortunate unpowered individuals seem to harbor a particular recessive Ultra-Gene that, once infected, protects them from the Z-virus but forces them to undergo dramatic physical and biochemical changes that break their minds, making them more beast than human. While most abominations come from mutated humans, there are reports of Animals becoming abominations. There is a huge 15-foot-tall Silverback Abomination, Designation: Silver Kong, that seems to eat zombies if you can believe it. That thing has been causing havoc along the southern coast.\n\nHorrors, on the other hand, are creatures summoned from other dimensions, demons, and other eldritch beings. Sometimes it seems Lovecraft was a little more on the nose than we all would like to believe.\n\n**Powered Individuals:**\n\nAnd now we come to superheroes and supervillains. But nowadays, does it really matter anymore? As long as they are standing between us and the Z’s, it's all that matters. This covers all the classic origins you know, like that kid from an alien world here to save us, and what good did that do us? She was probably Z’d too, for all we know, no, we would know if she was Z’d, right?\n\n**Robots & Other Tech Threats:**\n\nSome Robots pose a serious threat among the ruins due to their original programming—which was intended to serve—having been corrupted into a relentless quest to wipe out any signs of life, no longer able to distinguish between the living and the dead. These artificial foes present a distinct challenge, ranging from automated sentry drones armed with lethal precision to faulty repair bots roving old superhero headquarters, wreaking inadvertent chaos.\n\n**Zombies:**\n\nDead heads, Z’s, you all know what these are, the ravenous dead right out of Night of the Living Dead and other Zombie flicks. But I guess just normal zombies is just not good enough we have to deal with wired zombies right out of some crazy horror book. How some of these come to be, can be a bit complicated, there has been some chatter about some of these zombies being a version of abomination where the victims recessive Ultra-Gene fails to save them from becoming a zombie but does not quite activate their regressive powers, other wired zombies are the results of some twisted doctors experimentation, or a failed attempt to get rid of them. Regardless not all Z’s are the same.\n\n**Super Z's:**\n\nThe epitome of horror, super zombies combine the relentless hunger of their lesser brethren with heightened intelligence and superpowers. These are THE apex predators. Luckily, they are also VERY territorial and almost never work together. Facing a Super Z should never be taken lightly. Only those with inborn powers can become Super Z’s, but that’s not to say that these horrific adversaries are not capable of using technology, they most certainly are.\n\n## \\<h2\\>Animals\n\nHere are a few animal stats blocks. This is in no way an exhaustive list; feel free to modify these stat blocks to create or create your own animals.\n\n| **Alligator**  Zeta (1), Large Animal (Striker)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Pace:** 2 areas (2 Swim) |\n|   **Actions**  **Bite:** +6 to hit Av, reach: melee, one creature, Hit: 1d10+3 Kinetic.

\\<h2\\>Survivors: Allies & Adversaries\n\nOne of the greatest threats to an enclave often comes in the form of other survivors. Below, we provide some general threat blocks that you can tweak as needed, changing skills and equipment on the fly as you see fit.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Bystanders\n\nThese are your regular, run-of-the-mill survivors. Alone, they are not much of a threat, but they can be dangerous in large groups. Bystanders commonly possess a range of skill sets, with some individuals having specialized skill sets, such as a professional engineer or doctor.\n\nHere are some examples of common skill sets among common survivors:\n\n-   **Caretaker** (basic first aid, childcare, community support)\n-   **Teacher** (history, critical thinking, organizing people)\n-   **Handyman** (simple repair, tool use, fix-it knowledge)\n-   **Cook** (meal planning, food preservation, basic chemistry)\n-   **Custodian** (scavenging, cleaning chemicals, building familiarity)\n-   **Retail Worker** (bartering, crowd management, survival in chaos)\n-   **Farmhand** (animal handling, gardening, weather sense)\n-   **Librarian** (research, knowledge of obscure topics, filing systems)\n-   **Bus Driver** (vehicle familiarity, basic navigation)\n-   **Janitor** (lock keys, maintenance shortcuts, problem-solving)\n-   **Parent** (emotional support, multitasking, comfort)\n-   **Veteran** *(but not Special Forces)* (basic first aid, discipline, simple tactics, firearms safety)\n\n| **Common Survivor**  Bystander (1/4), Medium Survivor (Striker)                                                                                                                      |                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +2                                                                                                                                                                   | **Pace:** 2 areas |\n|   **Actions**  **Axe:**  +5 to hit Av, Reach: melee, one creature, hit: 1d8+1 (5) Kinetic.   **Semi-Auto Handgun:** +5 to hit Av, Range: 4, one creature, hit: 1d8+2 (6) Ballistic.  |                   |\n\n| **Avoidance** | **Fortitude** | **Willpower** |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 14            | 12            | 09            |\n\n| **Stamina**                     | **Wounds** |\n|---------------------------------|------------|\n| 20                              | 1          |\n| **DR:** Nil **Immunities:** Nil |            |\n\n| **STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **INT** | **WIS** | **CHA**  |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 10  (+0) |\n\n| **Skill Sets (Edge):**  A common skill set (see list) **Languages:** Local Language  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rank Bonus: +1                                                                       |\n\n| **Traits**  *Nil* |\n|-------------------|\n\n| **Gear**  Semi-Auto Handgun (1 restock of ammo), Axe, Bystander Go-Bag |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n### \\<h3\\>Hardened Survivors\n\nEspecially capable bystanders, hardened threats could be capable military personnel or raiders who travel from enclave to enclave, taking what they want and killing others.

\\<h2\\>Abominations\n\n### Silver Kong\n\nSilver Kong was once a majestic creature, a giant silverback gorilla residing in the Miami zoo, the head of one of the largest pods kept in captivity. In the wake of the Z-Day outbreak, a horde of zombies invaded the Miami zoo, overwhelming its defenses and claiming the lives of its entire gorilla pod. Silver Kong, too, fell victim to the horde, but instead of dying, he was turned into something more.\n\nInstead, he was transformed. From his massive frame, he grew even larger, towering at an astounding 15 feet tall. The once-majestic silverback had become an Abomination, a twisted amalgamation of his former self.\n\nNow, Silver Kong roams the desolate remnants of the Miami zoo, a colossal and fearsome figure. Striking fear into the hearts of those who dare to cross his path. Survivors who encounter Silver Kong tremble at the sight of his immense stature, his bestial visage. He has become a living legend.\n\n| **Silver Kong **Gamma (4), Huge Abomination (Bruser)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Pace:** 4 areas (4 climb)  |\n|   **Actions**  **Punch:**  +13 to hit Av, Reach: melee (2 areas), one creature, hit: 2d8+10 (18) Kinetic.  **Bonus Action**  **Roar:**  All creatures in 3 areas need to make a wisdom saving throw, DC: 16, or be *shaken* till the end of the next turn.

He had evolved from a bystander into a monstrosity of unfathomable horror. His body is bloated and scarred, covered in open sores that leaked a foul stink, and he stands at a ridiculous height of 10 feet. His sickly pale skin appears to be strained to its breaking point, ready to rupture at any moment. He holds a big cleaver in his gigantic grip, a primitive weapon fashioned from jagged scrap metal.\n\nThe Butcher's ravenous hunger drives him to pursue and devour survivors, reveling in the gruesome feast of human flesh. Interestingly, zombies appear to be utterly uninterested in consuming him.\n\n| **The Butcher of Paradigm City **Gamma (4), Large Abomination (Striker)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Pace:** 2 areas |\n|   **Actions**  **Cleaver:**  +13 to hit Av, Reach: melee (1 area), one creature, hit: 1D10+12 (17) Kinetic.  **Reaction** **Redirect Attack:** When hit by a ranged attack, perform a Power Check +12 vs the attack roll.

Everywhere. We lost Carter in seconds.”*\n\nThe Maw is not something you can reason with or even understand. It is older than the Z-virus, older perhaps than humanity’s memory of the earth itself. A thing that burrows through flesh and stone alike, it waits beneath the streets and ruins, patient as time, until it decides to feed.\n\nWhat it truly is, no one can say. A weapon buried and forgotten? A fragment of some deeper, more malevolent intelligence? Or simply a hunger given shape? Whatever it was, it was not born of a mother or grown in a lab; it was always here.\n\nThe Maw does not hunt for sport, or revenge, or even need. It devours because it must, tearing through everything, even the undead, leaving only silence and a few flecks of bone to mark where you stood.\n\nYou don’t see the Maw coming.

The swallowed target is *blinded* and *Restrained (Immobilized)*; it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the maw, and it takes 3d6 (10) acid damage at the start of each of the maw's turns. The Maw can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the Maw dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse.

For the riddle of why those imbued with abilities far beyond those of mortal men are able to retain a semblance of their intellect, while normal men are raised from the dead with little more than the cognitive ability to recognize a food source and feed upon it, is one which only someone of my soaring intellect could possibly answer.*\n\n*I am convinced that virus that animates the dead somehow recombines differently with the mutated DNA of these Homo-Superiors; that much is obvious even to the muscle-bound Titan. The question is ‘Why”? Why does this particular virus seem to bind itself into a symbiotic relationship with their genetic makeup, while acting as a ravenous parasite on the rest of our species?*\n\n*To answer that, I will need to acquire that new electron microscope that Dr. Denton had developed before the coming of Z-Day. With the limited power available for my cyborgs however, I hope they are up to the task of distracting the now-predatory Denton Dynasty while I liberate the device.*\n\n*While the danger is high, the chance to finally uncover the mystery behind the ruination of humanity and perhaps discover a way to reverse it is well worth any risks.*\n\n\\<h2\\>**The Psychology of a Super Zombie**\n\nWhile most of the Risen Dead have the cognitive ability of a lower-class animal species, able to identify food and devour it, those who manifested some “super-power” or ability prior to being infected and reanimated manage to retain a high level of intellect, albeit without the capacity to tell between right and wrong or even empathize with their victims.\n\nThe reason for this remains unknown at this time and may never be revealed. What is known is that the Super-Zombie, regardless of the retention of a measure of their intellect, is known to behave in certain patterns that may save the life of the Living if they are aware and able to act upon this information.\n\n\\<h3\\>**Cunning and Resourcefulness**\n\n*“Torch?” said Stonehenge into his mike, “I have a pack of Z’s shambling up to the west gate. Engaging to disperse.”*\n\n*“Negative, Stonehenge”, came the staticy voice of the Liberty Torch, “Wait for back up. I can have Power House and Arc Lightning at your 20 in ten minutes.”*\n\n*“They’re just a bunch of Z’s, Torch,” replied Stonehenge as pieces of asphalt and stone flew to him and began shaping itself into his trade mark rocky armor. “Nothing I can’t handle.”*\n\n*Muting his ear piece so as not to hear the Torch’s maternal warnings, Stonehenge leapt over the barricade and jogged towards the shambling group. The Torch meant well, but with each loss, she became more and more overprotective – smotheringly so.*\n\n*Besides, there was no better way for blowing off steam than wading into a bunch of mindless Z’s that couldn’t crack his rocky shell. His sledgehammer sized fists smashed into the first few of the Undead; pulping their rotting heads like over ripe melons. With each Z that he took down, layers of black effluvia that had the consistency of molasses stained his stony fists.*\n\n*That’s when Stonehenge made a fatal error - fighting against creatures that have no hope of hurting you makes one complacent; your mind tends to wander while your body goes on auto-pilot. Thoughts began to pop into his head: that was the problem with Paradigm City’s most abundant residents – to paraphrase that old chips commercial – smash all you want; there’s so many more. He wondered how many they would need to destroy - you can’t really kill the dead – until they could start to rebuild civilization; maybe have some sort of normal life again.*\n\n*Seven kills into the fight, his attention was brought back to the scene of carnage by a sepulchral voice dripping with malice. “That doesn’t seem fair – you seem to be having all the fun while they can’t even scratch your hide. Here – let’s even things up!”*\n\n*‘Z’s can’t talk’, was the first thing to cross his mind as his attention snapped back to the present. Then pain – searing pain - more terrible than any he had felt in a very long time erupted across his left arm. Blinking the tears out of his eyes he saw the Wrecker shrugging off an old moldering coat as he held the stony carapace that once protected the Hero’s arm. Raw pieces of bloody muscle tissue were still affixed to the armor, leaking bright red.*\n\n*Ripping a gobbet of meat from the inside of the rocky shell, like a man eating a succulent lobster, the Wrecker smiled as he smeared red across his rotting lips, “Mmmm…see I thought that with all that weight lifting you’d be tough as jerky, but nope…you’re as tender and juicy as that teenager I feasted on last week.*\n\n*“Now come on…don’t make us all wait for dinner!”*\n\n*As Stonehenge felt himself being ripped apart and shock starting to set in, his mind rebelled against what had just happened. He forgot that while Z’s don’t plan ambushes, Z’d Supers do. The Wrecker had hid in plain sight, waiting for some idiot to come along, get overconfident and plow into a mob of Z’s like he was playing a video game in God-mode.*\n\n*Too bad it was a lesson that Stonehenge learned too late.*\n\nUnlike their unpowered counterparts, the Super Zombie has been able to retain its intellect, though its thoughts and actions are always colored by barely restrained rage and an almost overpowering hunger.\n\nTo be clear, a Super Zombie will never be found contemplating its existence in a philosophical reverie, no matter how sated it may be. Its ability to plan and formulate strategy is akin to a wild animal’s cunning, but elevated to the level of a human’s cognitive ability. Thus, while “normal” zombies react to stimuli, usually in the form of a living food source, the Super Zombie is able to plan ambushes, use shortcuts to head off potential victims, or lay elaborate traps to capture their food. Additionally, the Super-Zombie can be patient if it reasons that there is a greater chance of success if it bides its time rather than attack in an explosion of savage fury.\n\nSitting at the top of the world’s new food chain, the Super-Zombies are the ultimate predators with mankind (Homo sapiens and superior alike) having been knocked from the top perch and finding themselves the hunted.\n\n\\<h3\\>**Appealing to their Better Angels**\n\n*The Grit lamp pole tightened across her chest with every breath becoming harder to make. She looked into the eyes of the man that she had idolized for so many years and finally married just months before Z-Day.*\n\n*They said it was a waste of time to appeal to them; to beg for mercy – but this was the Grit Master, Frank Eisen, the kindest man she had ever known. And if anyone could reach him, it was her; after all, didn’t he confess that he had never loved anyone as much as he did her?*\n\n*“Frank – please…look at me! This is Betty – your ‘Bets’. You have to stop, my love. You’re hurting me! Remember the times we had together – our wedding where you tripped on the way out of the church and we spilled down the stairs. And our honeymoon, Frank – remember what a magical time we had in Italy together!*\n\n*“Please stop Frank – you’re killing me!”*\n\n*“Oh stop fussing, Bets! I’m not going to kill you?”  \n “You’re not,” Betty Eisen asked, her voice cracking with hope?*\n\n*“Of course not, darling. I prefer my meat fresh. And I’m sure I can keep you breathing for days, so I can enjoy you piece by piece!”*\n\nDuring the first few weeks of the global phenomenon known as Z-Day, the Heroes who had so gallantly defended the Earth and humanity began to fall one by one. While the surviving populace mourned their loss, they began to watch in horror as their once dedicated defenders turned into amplified versions of the Risen Dead that now stalked them.\n\nAt first, discovering that their champions were not mindless death machines gave the people hope – hope that these ‘Z’d’ Super Heroes could be reasoned with; that some spark of their humanity still existed in their stilled hearts. Those hopes were soon dashed when the men and women who had sacrificed so much to protect them, laughed mercilessly as they descended upon them in a feeding frenzy!\n\nSome of the brightest medical scientists left theorized that the virus reanimating the dead Supers has somehow scrubbed away their ability to tell right from wrong or from developing any sort of empathic bond with any living (or unliving, for that matter) being. Though able to reason, interact and even form strange and bizarre communities amongst themselves, the Z’d Heroes no longer had the ability to connect with their former fellows or even loved ones. If asked by a clinician to label such behavior, these Z’d Heroes’ behavior might be construed as sociopathic, given their amoral and self-serving nature. Yet when one couples it with their animalistic aggression and savage nature, their behavior would quickly be characterized as psychopathic.\n\nImagine a serial killer with powers and abilities beyond the ken of mortal man; truly a nightmarish scenario!\n\n\\<h2\\>**The Ultra Z’d and its Territorial Nature**\n\n\\<\\<INSERT ART – Z’d Titan vs Z’d Judgment\\>\\>\n\n*Balor was sure that the car tumbling just over his head was the new Beamer that he had wanted so badly. At least he had before all hell had – literally – broken loose. He winced as it crashed through a glass window and its front end crumpled. Even German engineering couldn’t build a car that could withstand the pummeling of a Z’d Super.*\n\n*“Why are we running,” huffed Power House? “I say we stand and fight! I think he’s overrated. We can take ‘im!”*\n\n*“I fought alongside Titan, when he and Nuada used to team up back in the day,” Balor said as he sprinted down the cluttered and debris strewn side walk. “Believe me, laddie – we couldn’t take him on his worst day!”*\n\n*Another bellow, made mostly inarticulate from the rage that blinded Titan. The team had snuck into the Ultra hero’s lair and managed to free Templar before he (it?) could dine on her. Unfortunately, they were too late for the other poor innocents that had been captured alongside her.*\n\n*In his usual manic manner, Velocity zipped around the group of heroes as they made their way deeper into the financial district. “Comeoncomeoncomeon…. he’sgettingreallyclose!” A pause, which for Velocity must have been the equivalent of a lengthy moment of consideration, then, “Whyarewegoingthisway? Nonono..thiswasabadidea!”*\n\n*The rest of the team gave Balor an anxious look as they made their way into the Financial District of Paradigm City. They’d been playing a game of cat and mouse with Titan, but the transformed super hero was getting closer with every passing minute, not to mentioned more enraged, while they were getting tired and nowhere near any known sanctuaries or enclaves.*\n\n*“Just get across this next street and get ready!” the former sidekick of Nuada, leader of the legendary Irish super hero team, the Tuatha De’ Danann ordered. Weaving through the obstacle course of abandoned Mercedes Benz, town cars and the occasional limo, the weary group found shelter in the marbled entrance to a prominent investment bank building.*\n\n*Just across the way, bounding down the avenue on its powerful legs, came the juggernaut known as Titan! It still hadn’t caught sight of them, but the team knew it was just a matter of time.*\n\n*“Now what?”, exclaimed Power House between gulps of air.*\n\n*“Now, we hope that the intel the Night Lord gave us was right.” With a short muttered prayer to all the saints that ever were, Balor let loose his trademark laser vision in one concentrated blast. Ruby red twin beams of coruscating energy sliced into the building across the way; stone and steel melted under his baleful gaze and a few tons of rubble tumbled to the ground, releasing a gigantic plume of dust into the sky.*\n\n*“You idiot!” screamed Power House. “You just killed us all!”*\n\n*And right on cue, the ravaged form of Titan landed just feet from the huddled heroes.*\n\n*“That was stupid, kid!” laughed Titan. “I never did like you Balor. You were just a little snot nosed kid that Nuada let hang around. I thought you were a pain back then and my opinion hasn’t changed. Except that you’ve grown a lot dumber. That wasn’t even close to where I was. If that was a trap, you sprung it way too soon, boyo!”*\n\n*His eyes still smoldering from the titanic release of power, Balor looked up and over Titan’s shoulder. “That wasn’t meant for you, loud mouth!”, he said nodding to something behind the Z’d super.*\n\n*Before he could turn to see what Balor was talking about, Titan was slammed into the street by a flashing blur of red and gold. Standing above the shaken super was another Z’d super, this one a former arch villain that had plagued Paradigm City for years: the self-proclaimed champion of the proletariat, the Judgment of the People or Judgment for short.*\n\n*The premier defender of the fallen Soviet Union, Judgment would have been awe inspiring in his red and gold spandex uniform, his crimson cape and his trademark hammer and sickle held in its powerful arms, were it not for the grey tinged skin and a rictus smile fixed permanently on his face where some other super had ripped a portion of his mouth off.*\n\n*“You should know better than to intrude upon my territory, comrade,” the sibilant voice of the new comer stated calmly. “Now it is time for you to face your final Judgment!” And with that, the two Ultra Z’s engaged in battle.*\n\n*“Nowwhat?, buzzed Velocity?*\n\n*“Now,” said Balor, “we run!”  \n*\n\nOne interesting characteristic that has been noted by the surviving heroes is that Z’d supers appear to be extremely territorial, to the point that they will fight one another should the invading party not withdraw immediately. This characteristic may be due to the underlying aggression that seems to drive these reanimated beings.\n\nThe late and lamented Beast Master, an imminent naturalist, postulated that Z’d Supers demonstrated all the behavioral traits of top predators in the wild. Beast Master further characterized their behavior as one where the strongest of the Z’d was compelled to prove their position as an Ultra being by killing or driving off all comers or in some cases, allowing the weaker Z’d to submit to them, once again demonstrating dominance.\n\nWhile most animals exhibit such behavior, it is usually due to their drive to mate and procreate. Given that Z’d Supers are in a mixed state of consciousness and death, mating, one hopes, is not the compelling drive at work here.\n\nSo what makes a Z’d Super act in the manner that it does? The answer appears to be food. These infected Supers have taken the vice of gluttony to all new levels; gorging themselves on the flesh of their victims, even past the point of satiation, and stopping only when their stomachs are so full and distended that there is the possibility of damage to their digestive system.\n\nAnd herein lies the possible answer to the Z’d Super’s volatile anger – with both the normal Risen Dead and the Z’d unable to digest dead or rotting meat, they have no choice but to battle over the dwindling food sources left; namely the living.\n\nIt is this overriding motivation that compels the Risen and the Z’d to act as they do – from their seething rage to the establishment of dominance among their fellow dead. But not all Z’d Supers act solo; some have actually banded together and formed a social structure similar in nature to packs, even down to a sophisticated pecking order that makes for a stable social order.\n\nAs to why some of the Z’d prefer to remain solitary predators rather than team up with others of their kind is something that we may never know, but should be ever grateful for.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Wolf Pack Social Structure**\n\n*The Constrictor and Arsenal sloughed through the stagnant and fetid labyrinth that were the sewers of Paradigm City in search of a former petty super-villain whose only power was to turn herself into a two-dimensional state, earning her the sobriquet of the Paper-Thin Thief. Being one of the first Z’d supers, she was a menace that would have bordered on the comical if it weren’t for the fact that she’d devoured three members of the enclave.*\n\n*Former enemies before Z-Day, Arsenal and Constrictor were tasked with bringing in the absurd killer before she struck again. Just their luck that she had a tendency of making her hide out down in the sewers.*\n\n*Shining their flashlights about in a large reservoir dome, Constrictor saw the petty thief trying to hide herself like an ancient drawing in an Egyptian tomb. “Alright PT, this ends here. Why not make this easy for us and we’ll make sure we give you a clean and quick death.”*\n\n*Arsenal shook his head, trying his best not to breathe in the foul air when he spoke. “She’s already dead, fool! Let’s just take her out quick. She’s no match for the two of us!”*\n\n*Peeling herself from the wall, an ashen grey face that would once have been called beautiful smiled back at them. “You boys are right. Little bitty me has no chance against two big strong Super Heroes like you.*\n\n*“That’s why I brought a little help.”*\n\n*The Constrictor’s blood ran cold as over a half-dozen heads of Z’d Supers rose up out of the putrid waters, surrounding them.*\n\n*Their screams echoed through the sewer tunnels long after they had stopped.*\n\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when the sight of a Superhero Team flying across the sky, such as Paradigm City’s own Protectors, would bring a smile to everyone’s face and a feeling of wellbeing. But no longer.\n\nIn this Grave New World, the very glimpse of one Z’d Super is enough to fill one with dread; the sight of a group of them will make the most courageous of men shake in abject terror!\n\nWhile an Ultra Z’d Hero will not tolerate another Ultra Z’d Hero poaching on its territory, some will allow other, less powerful beings to group or ally with it, forming a predatory pack structure or hierarchy. Even these reanimated beings understand that there will always be opponents bigger or stronger than it can’t possibly handle alone, thus necessitating allies that do not pose a threat to their position within the pack, but are still a benefit to it and the group as a whole.\n\nAs mentioned, these groups of Z’d Supers tend to form a social structure similar to that of wolves. They will be led by an Ultra-Z, not necessarily a true Ultra, but the strongest member of the group.\n\nThe other members of the pack will naturally line up behind the Ultra, strongest to weakest. The Ultra usually keeps a wary eye on not only the Z who follows immediately behind him, but on any who dare challenge it for dominance of the group.\n\nFor some Z’s, it’s in their nature to challenge those who claim to be the strongest for the leadership position. When confronted, most Ultras will tear the contender to shreds, though some have taken perverse pleasure in maiming their opponent to the point that they now occupy the lowest rung of the pecking order.\n\nSome living survivors have observed that the Ultra of a group of Z’s tends to get the choicest pieces of meat and eats first. Should there be only one victim to satiate their endless hunger, then the others must wait until the Ultra has had its fill before slavering over the remains.\n\nSome scientists speculate that there must be a fragment of a memory of their time grouped with others of their ilk, forming famed Super Hero (and Super Villain) teams. Could it be that some part of their psyche longs for companionship or camaraderie? For all of their savagery, there is still something human within them and human beings are, by nature, social beings.\n\nPerhaps this new form of (un)life is still evolving and mutating into another stage; something that can be reasoned with or live in peaceful coexistence with sometime in the future? Some warn us that such speculations and hopes are doomed from the start. Even if these creatures signify some new version of man, humanity’s history with a sub-species should give us an insight on the ultimate result. Once there were as many as three different types of humans roaming the earth simultaneously; within a few centuries there was only one.\n\nFor all our beliefs that we have advanced as a species, humans are a jealous lot and now we face a new species that is superior to the majority of the living humans left. The past doesn’t paint a very hopeful end for us.\n\n**\\<h3\\>Lair**\n\n*Gregory Austin awoke groggily and discovered that the incessant hum wasn’t just the ringing of his ears, but a cage of energy he appeared to be imprisoned within. Even gassed or drugged or whatever they did to him, a mere force field wouldn’t hold the Undying Man for long. That was when he noticed the IV attached to his left arm and the fact that he couldn’t feel his left leg. Not a surprise really, given that it seemed to have been expertly amputated.*\n\n*A raspy laugh drew his horrified attention to the hazy figure on the other side of the energy curtain. “Ah, good…you’re awake. I wasn’t sure what kind of sedative would actually work on that miraculous metabolism of yours, Gregory. Believe it or not, I actually had to use a type of nerve gas of my own design. It’s good to see that my calculations were correct once again!”*\n\n*“Denton,” Austin wanted to scream, but in his weakened condition came out as a strangled gurgle. “Then this must be…”*\n\n*“Good, good, my dear boy. You’re shaking off the effects of the gas already. You are quite the wonder and perhaps the ultimate solution to our problem,” said Dan Denton, also known as the Calculator, as he shambled around his laboratory looking for all the world like an absent-minded scientist, if such a being had a cranium five times as large as a normal man…and he were alive.*\n\n*“You have no idea how hard it was for me to keep the others from devouring every last tasty morsel of you,” chuckled the Calculator mirthlessly. “Especially Sandra, my daughter. I’m sure you recall her nom’ de guerre – the Flaming Fist. Why I had to give her and Robert a choice cut just to settle them down.”*\n\n*Looking into a powerful microscope, Denton nodded to himself and said, “Amazing. The cells in your leg are already beginning to regenerate at an accelerated rate. Why in less than a week, your leg will be fully restored.*\n\n*“Yes indeed! You are the gift that keeps on giving!”*\n\n*“Calculator. Dan. Listen to me. This is madness. You and the rest of the Denton Dynasty are ill,” pleaded the Undying Man. “Let me go. I know my way around the Denton Building. Do the right thing and just let me escape, my old friend. You don’t have to do this!”*\n\n*“But of course, I do, old friend!” smiled Denton through dead eyes. “According to my calculations, the population of the living will continue to dwindle while more and more of us will continue to be ‘converted’. Even taking into account the few of us you and your rebellion will eventually destroy, the living human race will cease to exist in less than 7 years, 3 months, 13 days and 9 hours, plus or minus a 0.3% deviation.*\n\n*“Then where will we be?”*\n\n*Ignoring the horrific madness and the thought of someone…something eating his leg in the next room, the Undying Man focused on looking around the mad man’s laboratory and trying to figure a way out of here.*\n\n*Oblivious to his former friend’s frantic thoughts, Dan Denton continued laying out his plan. “And that’s where you come in, Gregory. The Undying Man indeed. Calling yourself the Regeneration Man would have been more accurate! If I can figure out a way to duplicate your unique genetic structure and transfer it into the living…why we’d have an endless food supply. You’d go down in history as the savior of our new race!*\n\n*Pressing a button that released another canister of gas into the room, the Calculator continued his explanation as consciousness seeped out of the Undying Man’s body. “Now you go to sleep now, my boy. Rest up. You and I have so much work to do!”*\n\nZ’d supers, unlike the Risen Dead, are not always active. Whether their need to rest (if indeed it is a *need*) is a byproduct of their super powers causing their body to have a higher metabolic rate, due to a half-remembered memory of sleeping and resting, or perhaps just some deeply buried part of them that craves a bit of normalcy, the Z’d have some place to call home.\n\nThese ‘homes’ are referred to as *lairs* by most of the remaining heroes; a misnomer referring to a vampire’s lair from pre-Z-Day folk lore. These lairs have been made in as many different places as there are Z’d beings to inhabit them. If the Z’d Super enjoyed a previous base of operations or a headquarters, then they will do their best to reclaim such a place, possibly due to their familiarity with such an abode.\n\nFor example, the Denton Dynasty, a family of heroes famed for their multi-generational service to the city and the world, has owned the Denton Building since the beginning of the 20th Century, with some members having been born here. It is little wonder that those members of the family that were transformed during the onslaught of Z-Day immediately returned to familiar surroundings and set up shop, turning the venerable structure into a modern day house of horrors.\n\nThanks to the Intel provided by Night Lord in his monthly *tweets*, many of the enclaves know to avoid certain areas of the city or at least, be more cautious when entering them.\n\nSome of the known lairs in Paradigm City include:\n\nThe once prestigious financial investment firm of Lawton and Lynch’s downtown office building has been claimed, ironically enough by the former Soviet defender Judgment. None have yet to penetrate the lair of this very powerful Z’d Ultra, but he has been seen flying in and out of the building’s top floors.\n\nA group of at least eight (and possibly more) lower powered Z’d seem to have joined forces and prowl the sewers below the city. Individually, these former supers are no match for even one or two of the surviving heroes, but the fact that they seem to have perfected pack and ambush tactics as well as the ability to pop up just about anywhere in the city makes them a particularly dangerous group.\n\nOther Z’d Supers take over an area that makes little sense to others, but perhaps there is a personal connection or recollection associated with the place known only to them. Case in point is the Lone Tree Mall, where the vocal menace of the Z’d Sonic Boom has taken up residence. Recently discovered by a group of scavengers that broke into the mall looking for supplies that might be of assistance to their enclave, they stumbled across this malevolent creature. Luckily heroes were sent to investigate when they failed to check in and drove off the monster. Whether it has returned to the mall or found a new place to reside is unknown at this time.\n\n### \\<h3\\>Blackstalk\n\nSimon Blackwell was a Biospeleologist, a biologist who specialized in life forms that live in caves, when during an expedition to a local cave network there was a collapse of the cave floor. Injured and buried beneath tons of rubble, his last conscious thought was of a strange violet light coming nearer. Awakening, he found himself being nursed back to health by the strange subterranean people known as the Molindur. Years passed and the strange diet and medicine given to heal him began a strange metamorphosis. He developed strange and unique powers, powers that allowed him to control plants and vines to a terrible effect.\n\nWhen he finally reemerged on the surface, he was less than human but more than a normal man. Taking up the mantle of savior of the Molindur people, Blackstalk, as he now called himself, led a number of attacks against the surface world, but was always defeated by various Super-Heroes.\n\nSomehow, one of the Molindur became infected with the Z’Virus and began transforming others into the living dead, including Blackstalk. Renewed with a new sense of purpose and all-consuming hunger, he has once again invaded the surface world and has claimed Centennial Park as his domain. Setting impaled humans and super-humans about to denote his area of control, left unattended, Blackstalk and his minions could prove a threat every bit as deadly as the Z-Virus itself.\n\n**Personality Flaws:** Bloodthirsty, Zealot\n\n**Tagline:** “Face nature’s fury!\n\n| **Blackstock**  Alpha (6), Medium Super-human Z’d (Controller)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Pace:** 5 areas |\n|   **Actions**  **Animate Roots\\*:** +20 to hit Av, Reach: 15 Areas, one creature, hit: 3d6+10 (27) Kinetic or Piercing. upon a successful hit, the target is grappled (escape DC 17).

The composition of this “force” has eluded the world’s greatest minds. Regardless of what it is, the Defender has learned over the years how to manipulate these force walls to create armor, platforms that allow him to walk into the air, and deadly missiles.\n\nDuring the collapse of civilization during Z-Day, the Defender was on the outskirts of Paradigm City, holding back the hordes of undead. While pushing his powers to their limits, the Defender proved equal to the challenge… that is, until someone blew the bridges. His subconscious must have created a force bubble around him, saving his life from the explosion, then shutting off when he lost consciousness completely.\n\nIt was unfortunate that the Defender landed near the bisected body of a zombie, which crawled to him and began to gnaw through his footwear. The Defender awoke with multiple bites on his foot as well as other unprotected areas of his skin. Within hours, he was feverish and collapsed into a coma inside an army MASH unit. When he awoke, his hunger was uncontrollable, and he slaughtered the entire base. Now he moves about the city looking for new prey and eliminating other Super Z’s that he sees as competition.\n\n**Personality Flaws:** Lone Wolf\n\n**Tagline:** “You’ve got nowhere to run.”\n\n| **The Defender**  Bata (5), Medium Super-human Z’d (Striker)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Pace:** 4 areas (4 fly) |\n|   **Actions**  **Force Bolt:** +17 to hit Av, Range: 12, one creature, hit: 2d8+10 (18) Kinetic.  **Force Crush:** +14 to hit Av, Range: 12 (1 area), hit: 1d8+10 (14) Kinetic. **Recharge** 3-6.  **Force Grab:** +17 to hit Av, Reach: 12 Areas, one creature, hit: 2d6+10 (27) Kinetic.

Pretending to be a crime fighter was the perfect cover for his true goal: becoming the most prolific serial killer the world had ever known. Using his powers made it child’s play to carve up his victims, what the police and newspapers called “ritual killings”. Fools - they failed to see his true genius, his meticulous work in dissecting his subjects. He was up to 38 victims before Z-Day, and then it all became rather pointless.\n\nHimself a victim of a zombie attack and subsequent turning, Dr. Wraith now has a few new goals in mind: Pick off stragglers for food; monitor those Enclaves that have insufficient food supplies for winter survival and then hunt down those that have to be kicked out for the survival of the group; research the Z-Virus and hope to come up with a cure for the existing human populations, thus assuring a food supply. Test subjects will be needed, of course… Lots of them. Thus far, he has herded together a few humans for experimentation and has been able to hold off the burning hunger within him, but how much longer he can resist is anyone’s guess.\n\n**Personality Flaws:** Bloodthirsty\n\n**Tagline:** “This is really going to hurt.”\n\n| **Dr. Wraith**  Gamma (4), Medium Super-human Z’d (Controller)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Pace:** 4 areas |\n|   **Actions**  **Kinetic Blast:** +13 to hit Av, Range: 12, one creature, hit: 2d8+9 (17) Kinetic.  **Whiling Blades:** +10 to hit Av, Area: his and all adjacent areas, hit: 1d6+6 (12) Slashing.  **Telekinesis:** +13 to hit Av, Reach: 12 Areas, one creature, hit: 2d6+9 (15) Kinetic.

His remarkable ability to transform his body into an electrical current, as well as his complete mastery over electricity, has made him one of the City’s premier heroes as well as a well-respected ally of the Protectors.\n\nGiven his unique alternate form, Electrocity is one of the few heroes to travel into space and deal with a terrorist organization that had taken over a space defense platform and threatened to turn its weapon upon the Earth. It was in that space, on that platform, that he met the only person able to go toe to toe with him in whichever form he chose. The Lightning Master nearly killed him that day before he was able to turn the tables on him and his terrorist associates.\n\nUnfortunately, even the Man of Lightning must sometimes rest, and when he does, he is as vulnerable as any mortal. It was while resting that he was attacked by neighbors infected with the Z-Virus and eventually turned into a Super Zombie. With his wide array of powers, Electrocity is even deadlier now that his morality has been scrubbed.

A beautiful young woman named Jennifer Denton began modeling as a way to offset the disappointment of not having manifested any powers like those of her famous parents. However, during a swimsuit shoot in frigid Norway, her body reacted to the cold by engulfing her in flames. Elated that she had finally inherited her birthright, young Jenny became the Flaming Fist, able to generate intense flames that she can form into fireballs or gouts of white-hot flames.\n\nAlways cognizant of the paparazzi due to her career, Jennifer elected for a costume that left little to the imagination and flaunted her more mature body as she grew into womanhood. Needing little actual protection due to the heat aura she constantly generated, she had little to fear from bullets or the errant energy bolt. Unfortunately, when Z-Day hit, it didn’t protect her from the bites of a zombie that hurled himself from the rooftop as she flew by.\n\nAlthough she incinerated him, it was too late, and the virus had already begun to spread through her bloodstream.\n\nThat was when she discovered that her powers were to be the death of her. While cauterizing a recent wound has a very good chance of stopping the virus in its tracks, her specific powers made her flesh immune to burning. Within hours, the Flaming Fist joined the ranks of the undead.\n\n**Personality Flaws:** Ruthless, Unlucky\n\n**Tagline:** “Feel the burn!”\n\n| **Flaming Fist**  Alpha (6), Medium Super-human Z’d

The wall can be placed along the ground, wrapping around terrain or splitting a battlefield, but must remain a continuous, unbroken line. **Recharge 3-6** ** Rip and Rend:**  +13 to hit Av, Reach: melee, one creature, hit: 2d8+9 (17) Piercing, ignores 3 points of physical DR.  **Special (Celerity)** Flaming Fist may reduce the speed of an action to a bonus action 4 times, regaining all uses after a long rest. |                           |\n\n| **Avoidance** | **Fortitude** | **Willpower** |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 24            | 27            | 15            |\n\n| **Stamina**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Wounds** |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 5          |\n| **DR:** 53 vs fire, 7 vs ballistic/physical, 3 vs energy **Immunities:** Exhaustion, Frightened, Shaken, and Frightened.

From getting kids’ lunch money to eventually small-time robbery, he had a rap sheet longer than some hardened criminals by the time he was fourteen. As an adult, Lasker found that his strength and endurance bordered on the super-human, and as long as he only fought normal police officers, he was right. It was when a superhero would show up that his vaunted powers paled in comparison.\n\nAfter his last stint in prison, Lasker took a large part of his ill-gotten gains and gave every penny to Prof. Gojkovik, who promised to increase his power a hundredfold. The Eternal Man was true to his word, giving Lasker augmented strength as well as assuring him that once he started moving, he was an unstoppable force. He even gave Lasker a reinforced helmet to protect his head when he charged.\n\nCalling himself the Golden Ram, he went up against the best of the best – from Sentinel to Titan and held his own. Ironically, it was Titan, his archenemy, that infected him with the Z-Virus. Who else could penetrate his nigh invulnerable skin than a man with a jaw of steel? Now a Super-Zombie, the Golden Ram’s luster has dulled a bit, but he’s no less deadly than he was in life.\n\n**Personality Flaw:** Darwinist, Megalomania\n\n**Tagline:** *Try and stop this!*\n\n| **Golden Ram** Delta (3), Large Super-human Z’d (Bruiser)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Pace:** 4 areas |\n|   **Actions**  **Punch:** +11 to hit Av, Melee (1 area reach), one creature, hit: 2d6+8 (14) Kinetic Damage  **Charging Ram:** After moving at least 2 areas, the golden ram may make a melee attack against a creature in its area, +11 to hit Av, Melee, one creature, hit: 2d8+9 (17) Kinetic Damage, target must make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer *knockback.* **Recharge 3-6.

This proud man, the first of the Soviet Ultras, and arguably the most powerful, led the fight for Mother Russia from Moscow to the deserts of Afghanistan and even to the very doorstep of the capitalist dogs and their superhuman puppets.\n\nImagine how painful it must have been for this patriot to see everything he believed in turn to dust and confronted with the paradigm that the way of life he fought and bled for was a lie. Is it any wonder why he attempted to assassinate Secretary General Gorbachev, only to be stopped by those he led - the Soviet Guard?\n\nDisgraced and branded a traitor, Judgment was stripped of his citizenship and exiled from Mother Russia in chains. He decided to take his battle directly to those responsible for his current state – America. There, he regularly battled the likes of Sentinel and Titan, who became his most implacable foes.\n\nHe eventually became infected by the undead speedster known as the Blue Bolt and later watched with glee as everything that was America disintegrated before his dead eyes. In an ironic turn, while running amok in the heart of Paradigm City’s financial district, Judgment made his lair in the offices of one of the most prestigious brokerage firms in the world.\n\n**Personality Flaw:** Patriot (Soviet Union), Ruthless\n\n**Tagline:** Your Judgment is upon you!\n\n| **Judgment** Theta (7), Medium Super-human Z’d (Striker)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Pace:** 5 areas |\n|   **Actions**  **Hammer & Sickle:** +23 to hit Av, Melee (1 area reach), one creature, hit: 2d8+15 (23) Kinetic or Piercing Damage, Ignore AR of 7 or below.  ** Rip and Rend:**  +23 to hit Av, Reach: melee, one creature, hit: 2d6+15 (21) Piercing, ignores 3 points of physical DR.  **Special (Celerity)** Judgment may reduce the speed of an action to a bonus action 4 times, regaining all uses after a long rest. |                   |\n\n| **Avoidance** | **Fortitude** | **Willpower** |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 30            | 26            | 16            |\n\n| **Stamina**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Wounds** |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 6          |\n| **DR:** 7 vs ballistic/physical, 7 vs Energy.  **Immunities:** Exhaustion, Frightened, Shaken, and Frightened.

When the time came, they both enlisted in the British Army and were sent to fight in the Afghan War, serving with bravery and honor. It was while exploring an ancient fort in western Afghanistan that their unit stumbled across a strange artifact. The relic resembled a small egg made of an unearthly metal with a mercurial quality to it. When one of the soldiers went to unearth it fully, the relic let off a shrill scream before exploding. Of the six men in the unit, only Reid and Frank survived.\n\nAwakening in a hospital, the two slowly recovered and were honorably discharged. It was while they were convalescing at home that the two discovered that they had somehow acquired super-human abilities. Reid was able to manifest small constructs or solid light holograms as he would later conclude, merely by imagining it in his mind.\n\nWhen he approached Frank about his miraculous ability, his friend confided that he, too, was able to create things from his mind, but that they were more ethereal illusions than anything solid. When he went to demonstrate by creating an illusion of a dragon, he was astounded to discover that rather than a translucent, comical beast, this dragon looked solid, roared, and even had a distinct odor.\n\nWhen Reid attempted to use his power, he found that rather than small-sized constructs that he had to concentrate on maintaining, he could now create elaborate solid holograms with the slightest of thoughts. After some experimentation, they discovered that their abilities increased exponentially when they were in close proximity to one another.\n\nThinking it fun, they both donned costumes and sought out crimes to thwart, but on their first outing, the reckless use of their powers caused considerable damage to nearby buildings and badly wounded several innocent bystanders. Horrified, Frank vowed never to use his powers again, while Reid took it all in stride and continued on without his partner.\n\nWhen Z-Day arrived, Reid and Frank were reactivated and sent, along with every other able-bodied man, to deal with the surging tide of the dead. Infected during the first week of battle, Reid died and reanimated as a Super Zombie. Repelled by the heavy firepower of the remaining British forces, the newly Z’d Light Master knew that to survive, he’d need to have his powers amplified.\n\nFinding his old friend, Reid ambushed and infected Frank with the Z-Virus. Within hours, wracked by horrible fever and pain, Frank died, and the Z’d version of Mirage awoke. Now, the deadly duo spread death and destruction across the world on their Flesh Tasting Tour, as Reid likes to call it.\n\n### \\<h3\\> Light Master\n\n**Personality Flaw:** Bloodthirsty\n\n**Tagline:** I made this just for you\n\n| **Light Master**  Gamma (4), Medium Super-human Z’d (Ranged)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Initiative:** +2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Pace:** 2 areas |\n|   **Actions**  **Force Mini-Gun**  **Force Shots:** +14 to hit Av, Range: 12, one creature, hit: 2d8+8 (16) Kinetic. **Rapid Fire:** +14 to hit Av, Range: 8, 3 adjacent areas, hit: 1d8+8 (12) Kinetic. **Recharge 3-6**  **Force Objects:** Light Master can easily create basic force shapes, such as walls and bridges (no larger than 4 areas long).
