# **\<h1\> Building and running your Heroes’ Enclave & Hotel**

*Safety, community, and a glimmer of hope.*

Now that your players have finished building their heroes and you’re ready to tell a good story, let’s talk about where and who they call home.

Here, you build your player's enclave and its current sanctuary amidst the chaos of the world of *Rotted Capes*. Survivors understand the importance of a strong and resilient enclave; they are a family, relying upon each other to see the next sunrise. At the same time, your Survivor’s hotel serves as a fort against the hordes of undead, gangs of scavengers, and raiders.

As discussed earlier in Book IV enclaves (pg. XX), the enclave refers to the group of survivors, while your hotel is the current base of operations. Hotels may come and go, but it’s your fellow survivors that you lean on and protect when the zombies' brains hit the woodchipper.

## \<h2\> Core Concepts

Heroes don’t just fight zombies; they protect something bigger: the people and places that remain. Every Enclave has three narrative Characteristics and individual **Facilities** that the heroes can improve over time.

#### \<h4\> Enclave & Hotel Characteristics

-   **Cohesion** (moral, unity): Cohesion reflects the collective unity, trust, and emotional resilience of the enclave’s members. It measures how well the survivors work together under pressure, resolve disputes, and maintain hope in the face of the apocalypse. High Cohesion allows the community to act as one, supporting heroes in crises and reducing infighting. As survivors lose faith or factions emerge, Cohesion falters, making cooperation harder and risking fragmentation.
-   **Resources** (food, supplies, energy): Resources represent the enclave’s material abundance and stability, including food, water, power, and critical supplies. A strong Resources rating means the enclave can endure shortages, keep its Facilities operational, and provide heroes with what they need to succeed. As Resources dwindle, the community is forced to ration, Facilities shut down, and desperation sets in, making survival and recovery increasingly difficult.
-   **Security**: Security measures the enclave’s ability to defend itself against external threats. It encompasses fortifications, surveillance, concealment, and the vigilance of its guards. Strong Security keeps zombies, raiders, and rival factions at bay, buying the heroes time to act. As Security erodes, breaches become more frequent, attacks more dangerous, and fear more pervasive, threatening the enclave’s very existence.

#### \<h4\> Each Characteristic is rated:

-   **Exceptional:** The enclave excels in this area. Survivors are coordinated, well-supplied, or incredibly vigilant. Heroes benefit from a significant edge, reducing related Challenge DCs by 5.
-   **Strong:** The enclave is thriving in this aspect. Survivors are confident, systems are reliable, and threats feel manageable. Heroes reduce related Challenge DCs by 2.
-   **Steady:** The enclave is holding steady. Survivors are managing but face occasional struggles. No modifier to related Challenge DCs.
-   **Weak:** The enclave is faltering in this aspect. Survivors are strained, mistakes happen, and cracks show. Related Challenge DCs increase by 2.
-   **Critical:** The enclave is on the brink in this area. Survivors are desperate, systems have collapsed, and danger looms large. Related Challenge DCs increase by 5.

These are tracked privately by the Editor and expressed narratively.

### \<H3\>Utilizing Characteristics in Play

Each Characteristic and each Facility can contribute directly to challenges and dramatic moments. Here are examples of how to integrate them:

-   **Security**: During missions or when defending against attacks, reduce the Challenge DC of relevant defensive Challenges by the Hotel’s Security level.
-   **Cohesion**: When resisting fear, despair, or internal strife, heroes gain Advantage or reduced DCs on Challenges equal to Cohesion.
-   **Resources**: When supply shortages, energy issues, or crafting come into play, reduce relevant Challenge DCs by Resources if Strong, or increase if Fragile
-   **Facilities**: Facilities grant narrative permission and reduce relevant Challenge DCs based on their current Characteristics (Strong or Exceptional). Energized Facilities provide full benefits, while unpowered (ones that are weak or critical) still grant narrative permission, but at a cost. Additionally, Facilities enable unique actions: the Radio Room can contact distant enclaves; the Tactical Room grants planning bonuses; the Medical Bay improves healing and disease resistance.

**For example,** A hero repairing a SWAT transport would need a facility even to get it working. A strong or exceptional Auto Shop would reduce the Challenge DC by the Facility’s Characteristics when rolling to repair the truck.

#### \<h4\> Utilizing Enclave Characteristics and Facilities

Bonuses from Enclave Characteristics and Facilities should only apply when the heroes are within the Hotel or directly connected to it through a Facility like the Radio Room or Tactical Room. Benefits outside the Enclave should be rare and always framed as the result of a specific Facility enabling remote support.

Encourage players to invest in their Facilities, reward those who take the initiative, and actively include them in their story and facility. This approach also encourages creative use of Skill Sets, highlighting how some things can only be achieved with a functioning facility.

### \<h3\>Facilities

Facilities are places within a hotel in which heroes can fully utilize their skill sets in a safe, secure area. Facilities have a rank enclave, just like enclave characteristics.

Heroes can build, repair, and upgrade Facilities over time through missions or downtime. Example Facilities include:

-   **Medical Bay:** Improves recovery times, allows heroes to treat diseases and wounds more effectively, and reduces the DCs of medical Challenges and saving throws to recover wounds.
-   **Security Hub:** Provides surveillance and advanced defenses; grants Advantage or lower DCs on detecting intrusions or defending against attacks.
-   **Short-Wave Radio Room:** Enables long-range communication with other enclaves or independent survivors, allowing communication between the heroes and the enclave while opening new story hooks and alliances.
-   **Tactical Room:** Filled with maps of the city, old satellite photos, it’s a place where heroes can plan future operations. If the heroes meet and plan in a tactical room, they gain one communal plot point they can spend during the issue. Keep in mind that smart players might use their plot points to alter a scene before they even arrive on site, “hey guys, I used to have a safe house nearby, maybe we can use that as a staging point and get a nights rest before we head into the complex”
-   **Maker’s Workshop:** Supports crafting, repairs, and jury-rigging equipment; reduces DCs for engineering or crafting Challenges.
-   **Training Room:** Allows heroes and bystanders to train; over time, can improve the capabilities of the supporting cast or unlock maneuvers.
-   **Facilities have three characteristics:** Inactive, Functional, and Advanced. Improving their characteristics enhances their benefits and reliability.

#### \<h4\> Developing Facilities

Creating or upgrading a Facility is more than just something that happens in between issues; it becomes part of the story, a sub-plot that plays out over the course of a few issues, representing the challenge of building effective facilities in a post-apocalyptic world.

When a player decides to establish a Facility, they create a **shopping list** of the materials and actions needed to build it. The Editor then creates a list, called a **blueprint**, which might incorporate some or all of the player's **shopping list** as well as a few requirements of their own. This reflects how you don’t always know what you need till you need it. The **Blueprint** is kept secret at first, then later revealed to the player after the first few successful challenges.

Completing a Facility commonly requires 10 tasks, which brings it online at the rank of **Steady**. Improving it to Strong requires 15 Blueprint tasks, and getting it to Exceptional takes another 20. Heroes need the right Skill Sets to contribute meaningfully, and multiple players can work together to get a facility up and running.

### \<h4\>Managing Big Dreams: Adjudicating Enclave Builds

It’s inevitable. Once they get their facilities online, at some point, your players are going to look around their enclave and say, “Hey, you know what we really need here? A teleport pad.” Or some other off-the-wall idea. And when that happens, your job is not to laugh them out of the room; your job is to turn that wild idea into a story worth telling.

Building new gear, gadgets, or facilities in the enclave should feel big, earned, and memorable. But it also needs to be balanced, cinematic, and, above all, fun to play out.

First, encourage your players to come up with a *Shopping List*. This is their brainstormed wish list of parts, tools, and ideas. Don’t worry if it doesn’t make much sense. In fact, don’t let them get bogged down trying to make it realistic; half the fun is seeing what they come up with. Once they’ve handed it over, you turn it into a *Blueprint*.

The Blueprint is *your* version of the plan. It’s the actual list of requirements, skill challenges, and complications they’ll face. Flesh it out with what’s missing, scale it to their current resources, and, importantly, add a few complications.

Every big build should have a chance to go wrong. Maybe the power source is unstable. Maybe the noise attracts unwanted attention. Maybe one of the key parts they need is sitting at the heart of a super-zombie nest. You don’t need to sabotage them, but you do need to make it interesting.

From there, you set the Difficulty. Standard gear? That’s low DC, no fuss, done in a single interlude. But anything that replicates a power, teleportation, force fields, or weather control, should climb the DC ladder fast. Make them work for it. Consider breaking especially ambitious builds into phases, each with its own challenge and potential setback. Sometimes you’ll want to let the build stretch across an entire Issue or more. That’s fine. That’s the making of a damn good story.

When deciding how hard to make it, lean on the same principles you’d use for Restricted Challenges and Skill Set Challenges. Big builds are the perfect opportunity to reward creative uses of Skill Sets, Edges, and Deep Cut Moments. If someone’s niche expertise finally shines through, make it matter! If nobody at the table has the right Skill Set, that’s a chance to bring in a supporting cast member, or for the players to go on a side mission to recruit someone who can help.

And don’t forget to scale the payoff. Builds that mimic powers should always come with limitations. They might be fragile, fixed in place, prone to burnout, have a long recharge time, prone to malfunctions at the most inopportune times, and it's simply too big to bring along in the field. That’s part of the point, their enclave assets, not just extra powers strapped to a character sheet.

At the end of the day, your role here is to say “yes, but.” Yes, they can build it. But it’ll take time, risk, and a little bit of luck to make it work. When they finally get the thing online, when the lights flicker, the panels hum, and the teleport pad actually works, that’s your chance to let them feel like heroes who built something that matters. That’s the payoff they’ll remember.

So let them dream big. But make them EARN it.

**\<h4\> Developing new Tech or Magtec-based Powers  
**If you have a player who wants to start working on some new gear that emulates a power for themselves or someone else in the party, have them follow the same path as for building an enclave build. Have the players develop a shopping list from which you build out the final blueprint. Once the item is done, the hero for whom the item is being made takes the *Acquire New Power* feat. Note that a player can “pre-take” this feat at a lower level and “activate it” once they acquire the new power. Don’t hand-wave away this moment! Lean into it and use it to tell a story of everything the heroes had to go through to build it, make it matter.

**\<h1\>Home Sweet Home (Building an Enclave)**

Building an enclave happens in three steps: you choose its style of governance, set its starting characteristics, and finally flesh out some of its survivors. This foundation determines not just how the enclave operates, but the kind of drama and challenges it may face.

### **\<h3\>**Enclave’s Characteristics

Every Enclave begins with three key characteristics: **Cohesion, Resources, and Security.** These don’t have numbers; they are set on the narrative five-rank scale below. Each attribute starts at **Steady** by default, but players can choose to weaken one to strengthen another, reflecting the kind of story they want to tell.  
  
This keeps the focus on the fiction, and not on random rolls. These ranks can rise or fall throughout play as heroes succeed or fail, and as the Editor weaves events into the story.

### **\<h3\>Determine the Hotel’s Governance**

Every community needs leadership, even if it’s chaotic. Players can work with you to choose a style of governance, which helps define the enclave’s culture and narrative strengths and weaknesses.

-   **Consensus:** Everyone has a say, but it’s slow and indecisive. Tends to strengthen Cohesion but leave Security Fragile.
-   **Representative:** Elected leaders keep order without too much tension. Solid Cohesion.
-   **Anarchy:** Nobody’s in charge, which is oddly liberating for some. Cohesion suffers.
-   **Theocratic:** Guided by faith and ritual. High Morale, but rigid.
-   **Military:** Disciplined and focused on defense. Security is strong, but morale may be low.
-   **Authoritarian:** Control is absolute, Security is high, but resentment festers.
-   **Hybrid:** A mix of any two styles above.

Involve your players from the start. Let them imagine the enclave’s flavor, describe bystanders, name the Hotel, and decide its vibe. You keep the actual ranks behind the curtain, they’ll feel the narrative consequences without ever seeing numbers.

**\<h3\>Create some bystanders.**

An Enclave is more than its leaders and heroes; it’s the people who live there. Each player should come up with one or two bystanders: ordinary survivors with names, quirks, and small roles to play. They’re not fully-fledged crew members, but they give the enclave depth and color, and offer you hooks to pull on during play.

## **\<H2\>** Describing the Hotel

Determine your hotel’s location; this is entirely in the hands of the players, as numerous options would be daunting to list.

**Other Wilderness Hotel Examples:**

*The Treehouse Sanctuary:* A network of interconnected treehouses hidden within a dense forest.

*The Cave Stronghold:* A massive cave system fortified with traps and defenses.

*The Mountain Watchtower:* A high-altitude outpost situated on a mountaintop, where your heroes keep a vigilant eye on the surrounding wilderness and coordinate rescue operations.

*The River Outpost:* A fortified outpost located along a major river, providing a strategic location for heroes to intercept infected creatures and provide aid to river-traveling survivors.

*The Cliffside Refuge:* A hidden hotel built into the cliffs, offering stunning views of the wilderness.

*The Oasis:* A hidden oasis in the middle of a vast desert where survivors gather to replenish supplies, rest, and exchange vital information.

*The Swamp Sanctuary:* A network of elevated platforms and huts built within a treacherous swamp.

**Other ideas for urban Hotels:**

*The Rooftop Refuge:* A network of interconnected rooftops accessed through hidden passageways, where heroes watch over the city and coordinate their efforts against the infected.

*The Subway Sanctuary:* A defunct subway station converted into an underground sanctuary, providing shelter, supplies, and transportation for survivors.

*The Mall Stronghold:* is a fortified shopping mall transformed into a self-sustaining hotel where survivors from other hotels gather and trade.

*The Bridge Bastion:* A heavily fortified bridge spanning across a river turned into a stronghold.

*The Theater Haven:* A grand theater repurposed as a sanctuary founded by a group of artists.

*The Corporate Tower:* A high-rise office building transformed into a hub of a scientific research facility by what’s left of a mega-corp. They work to find a cure and develop new abilities to combat the infection.

**Other Hotel Examples**

*The Heroic Hall:* A run-down colossal mansion with buggy state-of-the-art technology, secret passages, and a somewhat dependable high-tech training facility.

*The Villain's Lair:* A hidden underground fortress, complete with elaborate traps, high-security systems, and an arsenal of advanced weaponry, once a secret base for a supervillain and their loyal henchmen, is long dead, or Z’d.

*Paradise:* An island just off the coast of a major city, just safe enough, well, until you remember zombies can walk along the ocean bottom.

## *\<h2\>*Example Hotels and *their* enclaves.

### *\<h3\> The Citadel, Paradigm City*

The Citadel is a fortified skyscraper located at the heart of the city, towering over the urban ruins. Once a bustling office building, it has been transformed into a haven for survivors and a base of operations for urban superheroes. The upper floors serve as living quarters and communal spaces, while the lower levels are fortified with advanced security systems, creating a nearly impenetrable stronghold. The Citadel stands as a symbol of defiance against the chaos of Z-Day, its walls adorned with makeshift art and inspirational messages from its residents.

The enclave within the Citadel is led by Sergeant Robert "Dropshot" Billiards, a decorated marine sniper who found himself in the city when Z-Day struck. Under his leadership, the enclave operates with military-style governance, ensuring order and discipline in these tumultuous times. Sergeant Billiards has conscripted not only survivors, but also several aimless sidekicks who lost their sponsor heroes during the outbreak.

While safe, the enclave has begun to crack under the weight of Sergeant Robert “Dropshot” Billiards’ iron grip. His obsession with maintaining order has devolved into paranoia: random inspections, harsh punishments for “cowardice,” and a culture of fear.

The rescued sidekicks, once hopeful, are now forced into dangerous scavenging runs without proper support. Billiards justifies this as “hardening them for the war to come,” but whispers circulate that he’s sending dissenters into no-return missions on purpose.

The Citadel remains the safest stronghold in the city… but more than a few residents dream of escaping it.

| **Cohesion:**                  | **Stady**       | **Gunsmith Shop** | Exceptional |                   |         |
| **Resources**:                 | Strong          | **Carpentry**     | **Weak**    |                   |         |

### *\<h3\> The Underground Bunker:*

The Underground Bunker is a hidden network of tunnels sprawling beneath the city, offering a concealed refuge for survivors. Originally constructed as a part of the city's old subway system, it has been repurposed into a secure enclave. Today, the claustrophobic tunnels of the Underground Bunker are equal parts refuge and trap. The advanced systems that keep it running also keep its survivors shackled: lights flicker unpredictably, doors jam at the worst times, and life-support malfunctions are common.

Dr. Emily “Patch” Parker holds it all together through sheer brilliance and caffeine… but even she has begun to fray. Her once-bright optimism has become brittle, and her obsession with maintaining the bunker’s systems has isolated her from her people. Worse, the bunker’s security systems seem to have developed quirks that she refuses to discuss, sensors that track the wrong people, turrets that fire without warning.

The community remains close-knit, but some wonder if they’ve traded zombies for a different kind of death trap.

| **Security**               | Exceptional      | **Short-Wave Radio** | Strong      |   |   |

### *\<h3\> The Wilderness Retreat:*

The Wilderness Retreat is a secluded cabin nestled deep within a dense forest, far removed from the chaos of infected cities. Surrounded by towering trees and accessible only via a hidden trail, this refuge offers a serene haven for survivors and heroes alike. The cabin, built from sturdy timber, blends seamlessly with its natural surroundings, providing solid and yet well-hidden shelter.

The enclave within the Wilderness Retreat is led by "Silverhawk," an ex-sidekick turned A-lister superhero known for her agility, sharp senses, and unmatched archery skills. Once the protégé of the legendary hero "Sky Guardian," Although Silverhawk is the de facto leader, the enclave operates via a government of consensus, ensuring that every member has a voice in the decisions that affect their community.   
  
From a distance, the Wilderness Retreat seems idyllic, until you’re close enough to smell the smoke. The forest’s natural resources have begun to dwindle after years of overuse, and tensions run high among the enclave’s residents. Silverhawk’s authority has come under quiet challenge by a growing faction of survivalists who believe the group needs to abandon “consensus” and take a harder stance to secure what little remains.

Rumors abound of poachers raiding nearby streams and sabotaging traps, and two residents have already vanished without a trace, likely dragged away by something far worse than wolves. Even Silverhawk herself seems more withdrawn, her patrols growing longer and her temper shorter.

The Retreat is still a sanctuary, but for how much longer?

| **Security**               | Strong          | **Short-Wave Radio** | **Weak**    |   |   |

### *\<h3\> Hotel Paradise:*

Paradise is an island located just off the coast of Miami, offering a deceptive haven in a world overrun by the undead. The island, about two miles offshore, provides a beautiful yet precarious refuge for its inhabitants. While it boasts lush landscapes and a variety of natural resources, the constant threat of zombies walking along the ocean bottom to its shores poses a unique challenge. The survivors have erected numerous fences around the island to trap and slow down these relentless invaders, but the island's large size makes it difficult to defend every inch effectively.

The enclave on Paradise is led by "Oceanwalker," a former Coast Guard officer turned superhero with the ability to manipulate water. Oceanwalker's powers are instrumental in defending the island, allowing him to create barriers and divert zombie hordes. Among the survivors is a genius in drone technology known as "Techie" Tom, who uses his expertise to scout the city from the comfort of the island, deploying drones to monitor zombie movements and gather vital information.

Despite Oceanwalker’s calm facade, the island is fraying at the edges. The relentless undead keep finding new ways to breach the perimeter, and every storm chips away at their precious resources. The consensus governance is increasingly deadlocked between factions who want to fortify at all costs and those who argue for evacuation before it’s too late. Oceanwalker himself seems torn; recent sightings of him walking the shores alone, whispering to the waves, have unnerved even his closest allies.

Techie Tom’s drones are the only thing keeping them one step ahead of disaster… but even he admits the batteries won’t last much longer, and some of his footage shows things crawling on the ocean floor that no one wants to believe exist.

| **Hotel Paradise** | **Facilities:** |                      |             |               |        |

### \<h3\> The Overpass

Perched precariously on the crumbling remains of a highway overpass, this so-called enclave is little more than a collection of tents, tarps, and gutted cars lashed together with wire and desperation. Below, the roads are choked with wreckage and slow-moving hordes, and the constant moan of the dead serves as a reminder that there’s nowhere else to go.

The Overpass is less a community and more a prison of circumstance. It’s “run” by Marcus “One-Eye” Vick, a petty gang enforcer before Z-Day who seized control early by knifing his rivals and declaring himself the only one with the balls to lead. His idea of leadership is simple: take what you can, crush dissent, and keep the strongest fed so they can keep everyone else in line.

Supplies here are dangerously low. Water must be hauled up from a distant, barely functional pump, often at the cost of lives. Food is rationed tightly, but nobody can prove who’s hoarding and who’s starving. The wounded are left to die rather than waste precious bandages, and anyone caught sneaking off or plotting escape gets thrown off the side.

Every day, new faces show up… and just as many disappear. The place reeks of desperation, sweat, and rot. Whispers of cannibalism circulate, but no one dares ask.

Even the zombies seem reluctant to climb up and claim what’s left here. Perhaps even they know the Overpass is already dead.

| **The Overpass** | **Facilities:** |                  |      |   |   |

| **Cohesion:**    | Weak            |                  |      |   |   |
| **Resources**    | Weak            |                  |      |   |   |

# \<H1\> Running the Enclave

Once your enclave is founded, it becomes a living, breathing component of the game. Below, we present two ways to integrate your players' enclave into every issue.

At the start of each Issue, roll 2d20 on this table to spark a new narrative turn. Each event can be run as a single Challenge, escalated into a Dramatic Sequence, or even expanded into a full Issue, depending on pacing and narrative weight. The Editor sets a base DC, adjusting for relevant attribute ranks:

-   Exceptional: Reduce DC by 5
-   Strong: Reduce DC by 2
-   Steady: No change
-   Weak: Increase DC by 2
-   Critical: Increase DC by 5

Skill Sets that logically apply should be encouraged.

**Example Event:**

**A Super Z becomes aware of the Hotel.** A player rolls to meet a Challenge (base DC 15) to misdirect or distract the Super Z. An appropriate Skill Set (like Stealth or Combat Strategist) applies, and the DC is reduced if Security is Strong. Each time this event recurs, the base DC increases by 5.

## \<H2\> The Creeping Decline

Each session, at the time of your choosing, whether at the end of an Issue, during an enclave interlude, or as a result of inaction, select one Enclave’s characteristics to degrade by one rank. This does not have to feel mechanical or random; it can be integrated into the ongoing story. Perhaps morale falters after a tense loss. Perhaps supplies dwindle in a bad season. Perhaps security weakens as fences rot and guards become complacent. Even without an immediate triggering event, the world’s weight should slowly press in. In this way, the constant need for maintenance, repair, and care becomes part of the narrative.

Facilities can degrade as well if left unchecked. Systems break down, equipment wears out, and what was once a gleaming centerpiece can become a liability if not maintained.

### \<H3\> Show, Don’t Tell

Don’t think of characteristics as a set of Characteristics but more like a collection of story prompts that spur subplots. *The enclave’s ranks should be invisible to the players.* They should have no idea how close they might be to a crisis or just how lucky they are.

When cohesion starts slipping, show it through whispered arguments, cliques forming, and the occasional shoving match. If resources run thin, let them see the empty shelves, taste the watered-down rations, and watch survivors huddling around dying candles when the lights flicker out. Even security can feel different when it falters, uneasy glances at the shadows beyond the gate, extra footsteps on the watch, and the sound of nails being hastily hammered into weak points. And Facilities? Don’t list their status. Show the sputtering generator, the offline cameras, and the wounded being treated on bare cots instead of in the once-pristine medical bay.

When attributes reach Critical, the story itself shifts. Critical Cohesion can erupt into outright civil war, with factions forming and splintering off. Critical Morale sees survivors giving up entirely, walking out into the dead-filled streets rather than facing another day. Critical Resources or Energy can grind the entire operation to a halt, forcing rationing, blackouts, and hard choices about who gets what. Critical Security leaves the Hotel exposed, and enemies, humans and undead alike, will waste no time exploiting it.

Facilities, if left to degrade completely, may cease to function entirely, removing their bonuses and narrative benefits. They may even become liabilities, attract danger, or drain precious resources.

At its heart, the slow erosion of stability is not just a mechanic; it’s a story engine. It motivates players to take the initiative and gives every choice weight. Don’t tell the players they’ve “lost a rank of Security.” Show them the cracks in the wall, the growing unease, and the bloody handprint on the gate that wasn’t there yesterday. Then let them decide what they’re willing to risk setting things right.

### \<h3\> Home Improvement

When players take direct action to influence the Enclave or Hotel, tie their choices to Skill Set-driven Challenges. A successful medical intervention might stabilize morale. A clever engineering fix could shore up Security. A well-played negotiation between rival factions might mend fractures in Cohesion. These aren’t just rolls, they’re moments to showcase each hero’s strengths and leave a mark on the story. When a player leans into a particularly thematic Skill Set or embraces a defining aspect of their backstory in the process, take note. Reward those moments with narrative spotlight, memorable consequences, and even unexpected breakthroughs; that’s where the game shines.

A temporary boost to one of the enclave’s characteristics can usually be achieved with a single Enclave Interlude and a successful Challenge. Permanent increases are more arduous, often requiring sustained effort across several sessions and a series of successful Challenges. These upgrades should feel earned, the result of focus, teamwork, and creative choices.

Players who ignore the slow decay of their home will see it slide further into decline. Those who rise to meet the challenge, however, will not only restore what’s been lost, they’ll make the enclave stronger than it ever was.

### \<h3\> Time and Teamwork

The heroes’ time is one of their most precious resources. Every Enclave Interlude comes at a cost: what you choose to fix means something else must wait. Temporary gains can usually be secured in one Interlude with a successful Challenge, but permanent improvements demand sustained commitment and cooperation over multiple Issues.

When multiple heroes work together on the same project, they shorten the timeline and increase the likelihood of success. Let teamwork feel rewarding, a testament to their shared commitment to keeping their fragile sanctuary alive.

# \<h1\>When the hotel is compromised.

No hotel is 100% secure, and most will eventually fall. When a hotel is compromised, it creates a critical situation for your enclave. This event can be triggered by various factors, such as a large-scale attack by a zombie horde, a super zombie assault, or the discovery of the hotel's location by a dangerous faction.

This becomes a pivotal set of issues where the heroes must protect the enclave as they seek a new home. This can unfold over one or several issues, but it should be a harrowing experience as the heroes and those under their care are left without the protection of a hotel. The heroes will need to navigate treacherous terrain, fend off relentless threats, and manage dwindling resources, all while keeping the morale of their enclave from collapsing.

## \<h2\>Founding a New Hotel

When it comes time to build a new sanctuary, lean into the collaborative spirit of the game, the Editor-in-Chief sketches out the bare bones of the new location (its size, its quirks, and the dangers that come with it), but the players shape its heart. Their choices will determine what their next refuge becomes.

**Building the Next Sanctuary**

-   **Editor’s Foundation:** As the Editor-in-Chief, you define the bones of the new Hotel: where it is, what threats it’s vulnerable to, and what opportunities it offers. Perhaps it’s a half-collapsed hospital, a maze of subway tunnels, or a cluster of fortified rooftops connected by scaffolding. Every choice you make gives it potential and gives it problems, fertile ground for a story.
-   **Player Investment:** Invite players to spend Plot Points, offer creative suggestions, and narratively invest in their new home. Maybe they scavenge better generators for reliable energy. Maybe they will uncover a forgotten armory and turn it into a Security Hub. The more they invest, the more personal it feels, and the more satisfying it is when they defend it. Encourage them to draw on their Skill Sets here, adding details that make sense for who their characters are and what they bring to the table.
-   **Gameplay Decisions:** As the story unfolds, heroes encounter missions and challenges tied to the Hotel’s development, negotiating water rights with a nearby faction, clearing out a mutant nest occupying a key wing, or jury-rigging defenses to hold the line while the walls are still under construction. Each of these moments gives their new home narrative weight and reinforces that this isn’t just scenery, it’s something they’re fighting for.
-   **Ongoing Development:** Once the heroes have settled in, the work doesn’t stop. They’ll need to maintain and improve what they’ve built, addressing damage, upgrading systems, and training new members of the enclave. A Hotel is never truly finished; it grows and evolves with the players and their story.

By involving players in the rebuilding of their new sanctuary, you keep them invested in its survival. Every wall they reinforce, every Facility they rebuild, and every survivor they save makes the Hotel more than just a backdrop. It becomes a character, a testament to their struggle and their hope.
