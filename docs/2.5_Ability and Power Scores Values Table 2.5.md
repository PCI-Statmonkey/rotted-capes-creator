# \<h1\> Ability and Power Scores Values Table

Both ability scores and powers scores utilize the same chart; for example, ability scores or power of 14 would have a base die of d8 and a +2 Modifier.

## \<h2\>Data Points

You have probably noticed that the Master Values table has a few data points. Strength based data points are self-explanatory, with some handy examples of what a character with a particular Strength is able to lift.

#### \<h3\>**Throw** Range

Throw Range is the number of areas an object of maximum weight can be thrown. Lighter objects can be thrown a number of additional areas equal to the difference between the Heroâ€™s throw range and the weight of the object. For example, someone with 48 Strength tossing a 6-ton school bus would be able to throw that bus a total of 16 areas (48 Strength has a range of 14 areas, while a school bus would fall within 34 Strength, a 2-area difference).

\<h3\>**Speed Data Point**

Top MPH, is the top speed of a character while out of combat. In combat, characters are limited to their speed value in areas. For example, someone with a Speed of 28 would have a top speed of 90 mph, but in combat would be limited to 9 areas of movement.
