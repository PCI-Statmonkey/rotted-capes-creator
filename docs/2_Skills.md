*Good morning. My name is Kath O'Malley. I've been asked to pass on a
few little nuggets of information. With my powers, they should sink in.
Just kidding! I wouldn't do that to you.*

*First, treat this world like it's Noah's Ark. Always travel in pairs.
It doesn't matter what you have to do, always have someone keep an eye
on you. If you need to pee or take a dump, the time for being shy is
over. The last thing you want is some zombie attacking you with your
literal pants down.*

*Second, remember, fire is your best friend in this apocalypse. It's the
only treatment for zombie bites. Always have a way to make fire-hand
sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, matches, a lighter, and some type of cloth.
Then, be prepared to treat the burn. Keep a close watch on the bite
victim. If you see signs of infection, you may have to make a tough
call. But remember, you're in control. Act quickly and quietly. And if
the worst happens and the victim turns into a super zombie, remember,
you have the power to end it. *

*Third, zombies, for the most part, are stupid. They don't use tools.
They can't open doors or windows. They can't get out of seat belts. They
can't climb ladders. They tend to be slow and clumsy. All they want to
do is feed. Single zombies are generally no threat. They should be taken
out quietly. If you go in guns blazing, the sound will draw every zombie
for miles. Zombies are attracted by sound and movement. If they see you
move, they will follow you. Sound can be your friend. Car alarms, car
radios, boom boxes, and anything that makes noise will attract zombies.
Just make sure you aren't seen while setting off your noisemakers.*

*Then there are the super zombies. These zombies are apex
predator-eating machines. They have no morality, and their intellects
are intact. You want to avoid them at all costs. There is a rumor that
super zombies can acquire more powers by eating other supers. If I am
bitten and in danger of turning, please blow my head off. My powers are
emotion control, mind control, and telepathy.  If I become a super
zombie, I can easily fool the guards, walk right into camp, and
discreetly start feeding on who I want to. *

*Fourth, dogs. Dogs are no longer man's best friend. They are
territorial, travel in packs, and most haven't had their rabies shots.
There is no cure for rabies, just a long, painful death.*

*Fifth, other survivors. You never know what to expect from other
survivors. Mel Brooks wrote a song, "Hope for the Best. Expect the
Worst". Other survivors are just as scared of you as you are of them.
Some may offer trade. Some may be just barely getting by. Some may just
be ready to shoot you and loot your corpse. Just be cautious. *

*You can almost always tell a building that has people. The windows will
be boarded up on the first floor. The smallest window will have a big
pile of garbage outside of it. People don't want to live in their own
filth. Bodies may have been burned or possibly buried. If there are
bodies in the street, check the position the body is in. You may figure
out where other survivors are sniping from.*

*On scavenging. Don't kick in every door. Learn to pick locks. Also,
make a little noise before going in. You may hear zombies stumbling
around the place, even the clack, clack, clack of gnashing teeth. If a
building has large glass doors or windows, and you must break them to
get in, try to break the lower portions and crawl in. Zombies are too
stupid to crawl in after you. *

*Always look for traps. Super zombies still have their intellects.
Snares and tripwire may hurt or cripple you, but you're still fresh
meat. Also, survivors will protect a stash. Some "Last Man on Earth" may
have a whole series of booby traps protecting his place. *

*Always shop with a list. Just get the stuff you need and get home
safely. Are there things you should always look out for? Absolutely.
Multivitamins. Unless you live on a farm, your diet is canned crap.
First aid supplies. Fire extinguishers. There is no 911 service.
Ammunition. If you need personal items, bring someone with you. Don't be
embarrassed if you need underwear or tampons.*

*Thanks for listening. Please come back alive and in one piece. *

In this chapter, we break down skills and how to use them to tell your
stories. This list is detailed but not exhaustive. Detailing a system to
encompass every possibility you and your fellow players can come up with
would be a herculean task and, honestly, constrain your creativity.
These rules are your basic guidelines, a framework to give you and the
editor-in-chief what they need while hopefully giving you enough of an
edge so as not to become Zombie Chow.

# Skills and Ability Scores 

While skills are commonly linked to a particular Ability Score, which
represents its most common use, you may use another Ability Score if the
situation calls for it. For example, you may have used Charisma with
Influence to calm down a frightened kid. Still, you may later opt to use
your Intelligence with your Influence skill instead as you attempt to
trip up a suspicious scavenger with leading questions.

Make the most of your opportunities and try to find ways to pair your
best ability score with your skills; sometimes it’ll work, sometimes it
won’t, but you stand a good chance of getting the Editor-in-Chief on
your side if you have interesting ideas.

For instance, you can pair Intelligence with any skill when rolling to
know things related to that skill. You may use Intelligence (Academics)
to determine the programs of a former college, Intelligence (Melee) to
determine what sports equipment makes the best weapons, or Intelligence
(Medicine) to determine if any hospitals or clinics in the area may have
supplies.

## Ability Checks and Skill Checks

An Ability Check tests your innate talent in an effort to overcome a
challenge, while a Skill Check tests your proficiency with a particular
skill. The Editor-In-Chief may call for either an Ability Check or a
Skill Check when you or a creature under the Editor-In-Chief’s control
attempts an action that has a chance of failure.

When an Ability Check is called for, the Editor-In-Chief decides which
of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty
of the task. When a Skill Check is called for, the Editor-In-Chief
commonly decides which Skill to use and which ability to combine it
with. However, this combination is not set in stone; as mentioned above,
you may always propose another pairing if you can justify its use.

For example, the Editor-In-Chief may require a Dexterity (Stealth) check
to set up an ambush, dexterity being that skill’s primary ability score.
But you may propose an alternate use of the skill. To assist your
friends in hiding, you opt to survey the area for the most advantageous
hiding spots, allowing you to use your Intelligence with your Stealth
skill to give your allies Advantage on their skill checks.

Once an Ability or Skill check is called for, the Editor-In-Chief sets
your target number or Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult a task,
the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most
common DCs. To make an Ability Check, roll a d20 and add the relevant
ability modifier or your Ability Modifier + your Hero’s Rank for a Skill
Check. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties and compare
the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability
check succeeds. Otherwise, it’s a failure, and what that failure entails
is up to the Editor-In-Chief.

## \<h2\>Skill Training

The only school left after Z-Day hit is the School of Hard Knocks. And
while you can attempt things you have never had any training in, having
a solid foundation in certain skills can make all the difference. Anyone
can sneak around (use of the Stealth skill) or even have read a book on
Sociology (use of Academics). Someone without a firm grounding in
Engineering (Robotics) wouldn’t know the first thing about building a
robot. Below, we break down various levels of skill training: untrained,
standard, focused

### \<h3\>Untrained 

You may make untrained skill checks with any skill that allows untrained
skill checks. In these cases, you make a skill check using the most
appropriate Ability Score Bonus plus your Hero’s Rank with a
disadvantage.

### \<h3\>Standard Skill Training:

You possess a standard level of training in a particular skill,
representing a standard level of competency. In these cases, you make a
skill check using the most appropriate Ability Score Bonus plus your
Hero’s Rank.

### \<h3\>Focused: 

You possess exceptional training in a particular skill. When making a
skill check within a focused field of study or specialization, you make
the check with advantage, using the most appropriate Ability Score Bonus
plus your Hero’s Rank.

## \<h2\> Skill Check Modifiers 

### \<h3\> Circumstances 

There are times when the Editor-in-Chief may grant you Advantage or
Disadvantage to your skill check when circumstances are in your favor or
against it. For example, the Editor-in-Chief may grant you Advantage on
a stealth check while slowly walking across a soft carpet. Disadvantage
on that same skill check if the carpet is saturated with water, causing
your steps to make squishing sounds. See Advantage/Disadvantage on pg.
XX.

## Cooperation 

You can combine your efforts on a single Ability or Skill Check with
other Heroes when not in combat. The assisting hero or bystander may
forgo any check of their own, granting you a +2 bonus on that skill
check up to a maximum of +4 with two assistants.

## The Right Tools for the Job 

Making an Action Skill Roll without the appropriate tools for the job
imposes a -5 penalty to your skill check. However, at the
Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, you may attempt to work with makeshift
tools, lowering the penalty to -3. Lastly, there are times when the
Editor-in-Chief may deem a task impossible without any tools.

## Passive Skill Use

Some individuals reach a level of proficiency with their skills where
some tasks become second nature; a firearms expert can take apart and
reassemble an AR-15 blindfolded. A master mechanic can listen to a
running car and tell that it has a damaged engine mount.

Any skill you are trained in has a passive skill DC. Your Passive Skill
Number for any trained skill equals 10 + Primary Ability Score
Modifier + Hero’s Rank; this number can come into play in two ways.

***Trivial Tasks:*** If a skill check has a DC lower than the passive
skill number, you automatically succeed in that skill check. Tasks with
a significant cost of failure (like pulling yourself back onto the roof
from a precipice) are never trivial tasks.

***Passive Skill Challenge:*** Sometimes, you may be required to roll a
Skill Check, Attack Roll, or an Ability Check against another creature’s
passive skill, DC.

For example, Let’s say you’re trying to hack into a former
supervillain’s computer system, and that supervillain became zombie chow
years ago. You’d perform a Skill Check against the former supervillain’s
Technology skill’s passive skill DC.

## Skills in a Fight 

Commonly, skills used in combat take an action, but sometimes you may be
forced to perform a little faster than normal or, if you have nerves of
steel, to take a few seconds to help guarantee success.

***Rush Jobs:*** Any time you are utilizing a non-combat skill in
combat, you may reduce the time required to perform the skill to a bonus
action by suffering Disadvantage on our Skill Check.  
  
***Just give me a few more seconds!*** Alternatively, you may opt to
take some extra time by using a Demanding action to make your skill
check. You gain a +5 bonus to your Skill Check. But if you must remain
stationary during your check, if you take any damage or are moved, you
automatically fail your skill check.

## Social Encounters 

The two most important skills in social situations are Empathy and
Influence. Empathy is the ability to read another person’s emotional
state or the attempt to convey meaning through expressions and gestures.
Influence is the ability to convince someone to give you what you want
or convince them that they want to help you.

Before any dice are rolled, the Editor-in-Chief is going to ask you what
you intend to say and achieve. If you sound persuasive enough, that may
be the end of it; you get what you’re asking for, and the struggle for
survival continues. If the Editor-in-Chief feels that rolls are
necessary, then they might assign the appropriate skills and any
circumstantial modifiers (telling someone to run while pointing a
glowing hand at them makes your argument more persuasive).

# Skill Descriptions 

All skills list that skill’s **Primary Ability Score,** the most common
Ability Score used with the skill. And whether the skill can be used
**untrained** or not. In addition, some skills may have a list of
specializations and focus.

**Fields of Study:** List of possible skill foci; learning a skill focus
gives Advantage on all skill checks when performing a skill check
involving your focus.

No list is meant to be exhaustive of all possible fields of study. The
editor-in-chief and players should feel free to create fitting fields to
round out their heroes.

Any time the rules call out a skill focus, it will be presented as
*Skill (Field of Study you focused with)*

## Academics

and tumble through obstacles and opponents.

**Suggested Skill Uses:**

- **Reduce Fall Damage**: An Easy (DC 10) Acrobatics (Dexterity) check
  to reduce your damage from a fall. Subtract the result of your roll
  (in feet) from the distance fallen before determining falling damage,
  rounded up to the nearest area. A fall reduced to 0 feet (or less)
  deals no damage. A focus on Parkour would apply to this check.

- **Tumble Past an Obstacle**: The Editor-in-Chief sets the Difficulty
  based on the size and nature of the obstacle. If you’re trying to
  bypass opponents, the DC is opposed by their Melee Attack roll or
  Empathy (Wisdom) roll.

- **Navigate Obstacles**: This is a challenging (DC 20) Acrobatics check
  that allows you to bypass physical obstacles or tight spaces
  gracefully.

## Animal Handling 

**Primary Ability Score:** Wisdom

  solution in a high-stress situation, like rigging a broken drone to
  function temporarily.

- **Specialized Tasks**: Attempting specialized tasks with a DC of 20 or
  greater (such as hacking a secure PC) imposes Disadvantage on your
  skill check even if you have a focus in this skill.

## Drive 

**Primary Ability Score:** Dexterity

**Untrained:** Yes

**Fields of Study:** Automobiles, Motorcycle, Power Boat, Sailboat,
Trucks.

This skill allows you to drive motorcycles, trucks, and boats. Most
people are presumed to have a basic facility for driving. Being trained
in this skill allows you to perform complex maneuvers and conduct
regular maintenance.

**Suggested Skill Uses:**

- **Basic Driving**: Driving vehicles under normal conditions does not
  require a skill check.

## Empathy 

**Primary Ability Score:** Wisdom

**Untrained:** Yes

Empathy is your ability to read another’s emotional state and mannerisms
and, in general, notice when something is amiss. By no means is Empathy
a science; it’s more about relying upon your intuition and developing
insight into the motivations of others. Empathy is primarily used for
social encounters where you are trying to get a “read” on someone.

**Suggested Skill Uses:**

- **Get a “Read” of Someone**: An Empathy (Wisdom) check against your
  opponent’s Influence (Charisma) if they are attempting to convey
  different intentions or Influence (Intelligence) if they are using a
  poker face.

- **Convey Emotions**: This is a challenging (DC 20) skill check that
  requires using gestures and expressions to communicate nonverbally,
  such as indicating danger or expressing trust without words.

- **Sense Motives**: This is a routine (DC 15) skill check to determine
  if someone is nervous, fearful, or otherwise emotionally compromised,
  which might indicate they are hiding something or under duress.

- **Detect Subtle Changes**: Using Intelligence instead of Wisdom, a
  Routine (DC 15) skill check to detect subtle changes in someone’s
  behavior or body language that might indicate stress, deceit, or other
  underlying emotions.

  check to read the emotional atmosphere of a group, identifying
  underlying tensions, alliances, or conflicts.

\<side bar\>

**Editor’s Note: What Empathy is and is not.**  
Empathy is not the ability to know either when someone is telling a lie
or when someone is concealing something. This skill is not a
truth-detector, nor is it a substitute for role-playing. It is intended
solely to indicate another person's emotional state.  
\</side bar\>

## Engineering 

**Primary Ability Score:** Intelligence

**Untrained:** No

**Fields of Study:** Aeronautical Engineering, Automobile Mechanic,
Cybernetics, Electrical Engineering, Metalworking, Mechanical
Engineering, Robotics, Structural Engineering, and Weapons Engineering.

You can perform impressive acts of engineering, such as repairing an
experimental plasma rifle or repairing a set of low-light optics.
Complex and thorough repairs (such as rebuilding an engine) or building
items from scratch (and scraps!) require prolonged skill checks.

If you are not trained in Basic Engineering, when you are making a skill
check that includes some aspect of a specialization you are trained in,
you do not suffer Disadvantage on your skill check.

**Suggested Skill Uses:**

- **Basic Maintenance/Repairs**: Simple repairs that take about 30
  minutes and fall under your specialization do not require a skill
  check. Minor repairs that take an hour or two only require a
  successful Easy (DC 10) skill check.

- **Operate Devices**: Using common electronic devices and systems that
  fall under your specialization does not require a skill check.

- **Advanced Operations**: Hacking into systems or modifying advanced
  technology that falls under your specialization requires a successful
  Challenging (DC 20) skill check.

\</Side Bar\>

## Escape Artist

**Primary Ability Score:** Dexterity

**Untrained:** Yes

You know the assorted tricks and techniques that allow you to escape
bonds, such as handcuffs, ropes, shackles, and so on. You can also
contort your body into tight-fitting and small spaces. This skill often
involves various breathing exercises, dislocating your joints,
tightening and relaxing specific muscles, and the like. It is also a
purely physical skill, requiring no tools (although skill in Larceny and
a hidden set of lock-picks is always useful). The Editor-in-Chief will
determine the DC required to escape from a specific set of bonds.

**Suggested Skill Uses:**

- **Slip Bonds**: An Easy (DC 10) skill check to escape from handcuffs
  or zip ties. Escaping from a straitjacket requires a Challenging
  (DC 20) skill check.

- **Escape from a Grapple**: Use this skill in place of a Melee
  (Strength) check to escape from a grapple.

- **Contort Body**: A Routine (DC 15) skill check to fit through tight
  spaces or avoid physical constraints, such as squeezing through a
  narrow gap or slipping through a small window.

- **Hold Breath**: Using Constitution instead of Dexterity, a Routine
  (DC 15) skill check to hold your breath for extended periods, allowing
  you to endure underwater or in gas-filled environments longer than
  usual.

- **Avoid Traps**: A Challenging (DC 20) skill check to escape or avoid
  traps that rely on physical constraints, such as snares or nets.

## Influence 

**Primary Ability Score:** Charisma

**Untrained:** Yes

**Fields of Study:** Diplomacy, Intimidation, Persuasion, Seduction.

This skill enables you to convince others to do what you want, whether
through charm, debate, deceit, deliberation, intimidation, or
negotiation. More generally, Influence is used to engender fear,
respect, friendship, or even love. Most uses of Influence involve social
encounters, where you use the skill against an opponent’s Empathy. In
cases of debate, deliberation, or negotiation, your opponent may use her
Influence against yours, as you are both looking for something.

**Suggested Skill Uses:**

- **Deescalate**: An Influence (Charisma) roll can be used against the
  Discipline of an opponent so that they pause and listen to what you
  have to say, with a Routine (DC 15) skill check.

- **Negotiations**: Influence can be used for bartering goods and
  services in a world without currency. This is a routine (DC 15) skill
  check that may help you get extra supplies, such as an extra magazine
  or some extra water. Survivors are protective and knowledgeable about
  their needs, so taking advantage of someone is challenging.

- **Intimidate**: Issue threats or displays of power to influence
  others. This typically involves a skill check against the target’s
  Discipline defense, with a Routine (DC 15) skill check.

- **Persuade**: Using Intelligence instead of Charisma, a Routine
  (DC 15) skill check to present logical arguments and evidence to
  convince someone of your point of view.

- **Build Rapport**: This is a challenging (DC 20) skill check to
  establish a strong emotional connection with an NPC, gaining their
  trust and possibly their assistance in future endeavors.

## Investigation

**Primary Ability Score:** Intelligence

**Untrained:** Yes

This skill is used when looking for clues and making deductions based on
clues found. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern
from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or
determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse.

**Suggested Skill Uses:**

- **Search for Clues**: This is an easy (DC 10) to Routine (DC 15) skill
  check to find hidden or obscure evidence, such as locating a hidden
  compartment or finding bloodstains in an inconspicuous area.

- **Analyze Evidence**: This is an easy (DC 10) to Routine (DC 15) skill
  check to interpret clues and form conclusions, such as determining the
  type of weapon from a wound or the cause of damage to a structure.

- **Track Movements**: A Challenging (DC 20) skill check to follow
  trails or deduce the actions of others, such as tracking a person
  through a forest or piecing together a sequence of events from
