than equal to those of us who relied on a flashy power or two.*

# \<h1\> Maneuvers

During your turn, you may opt to use a Combat Maneuver. Some combat
maneuvers are attacks on their own, while others are combined with a
regular attack. You may only perform a single maneuver at a time.

The following is a list of general Maneuvers you can learn through
acquiring the Learn Maneuver feat \\ or as an advancement option for the
Highly Trained Origin.

All Maneuvers share the following format. If an entry is missing in a
particular write-up, it does not have that entry. For example, a
Maneuver without a Requirement has no requirements.

**Name (Type):** There are three types of maneuvers: Combat Maneuvers,
Leadership Maneuvers, and Weapon Maneuvers.

**Requirements:** Requirements necessary to learn to perform the
maneuver.

**Attack:** The Defense you are targeting with any modifiers to the
attack roll.

When attacking, use the appropriate power or skill bonus for the
weapon/power you are attacking with.

In cases where more than one defense or passive skill DC is listed, the
attack is performed against the highest DC unless otherwise noted.

For example*,* if the maneuver lists **Attack: Avoidance -3**, you make
an attack roll with a -3 penalty against your target's Avoidance. While
a maneuver lists Avoidance (Dexterity) for its attack, you would perform
the appropriate Attack Roll; attack bonus + your Dexterity against your
target's Avoidance, even if you were attempting a melee attack (which
commonly uses Strength on attack rolls).

**Action:** The Action required to perform the maneuver.

**Range**: Range of attack (melee or ranged) and, if ranged, the number
of areas the attack can reach and the possible number of targets; you
can attack targets beyond a stated range with Disadvantage up to a
maximum range of double the maneuvers base range.

**Effect:** The maneuver's effect upon a successful attack. The first
value is the maneuver's damage. Base means to roll damage normally for
that attack. Alternately, maneuvers may add a modifier to the damage,
for example, +1d6. In the case of a penalty, you deal a minimum of 1
point of damage. "None" means the maneuver deals no damage; this
includes maneuvers combined with a normal attack. Unarmed Attacks count
as kinetic damage unless otherwise noted.

**Special:** If the maneuver has any additional effects, they will be
listed here. This entry may be marked with additional tags, such as
Special (Limitation) or Special (Additional Effect), for ease of
reference.

destroyed, the target suffers any remaining damage (reduced by

your attack roll. On a failure, they move to another adjacent area of
their choice or fall prone.

**Special (Enhanced Strength)**: If you possess the Enhanced Strength
