# \<h1\> Hero Advancement

The thing about survival is, with time, you get better at it, or you
die. Crushing Z heads, fighting off marauders, fixing that finicky
generator, or finding a stash of antibiotics, the more you do it, the
better you get at it. Maybe you’ll sharpen your skills as you expand
your skill set. Maybe you finally get that new gadget to work, or put
the time in to mastering your powers, or even discover new ones along
the way. Or maybe you put the work in to improve your physicality or
sharpen your mind.

Before Z-Day, governments assigned power categories to both heroes and
villains, some governments adopted a categorization akin to powerful
storms with powered individuals given a numerical value from Category I
for the weakest powered individuals to Category V for the most powerful
earthy powered individuals and Category X being reserved for Cosmic
level threats. In the online space scores of vloggers, many
self-proclaimed superpower experts poured over hours and hours of
footage to develop power rankings. Ranking heroes using Greek
alphabetical letters ranging powered individuals from Delta for the
weakest to Omega for the most powerful of earth’s individuals. But it
was one naming convention that grew out of the classic media, enduring
even in alternate media space before Z day, one splitting heroes and
villains alike into A-Listers and Ultra-Listers, the big names, the ones
to watch, and the B-Lister, the forgettable street-level heroes and
villains or plucky sidekicks.

After completing an issue, your editor-in-chief will commonly award you
a level increase. Once you reach the 10<sup>th</sup> the next level sets
you at level 1 of the next rank. For Example, as an Epsilon (Rank 1)
hero, once you finish your 11<sup>th</sup> issue you would become a
level 1 Rank 2 (Delta) hero.

### \<h3\> Beyond rank 6: Omaga Level Heroes

Omega-level heroes and threats represent the pinnacle of power,
possessing cosmic-level abilities that far surpass the capabilities of
ordinary heroes. These beings, often referred to as Omaga-level heroes,
wield such immense power that they exist beyond the scope of typical
gameplay in Rotted Capes. While the game system is designed with limits
to maintain balance, it theoretically allows for conscious extrapolation
beyond Rank 7, imagining powers and threats of even greater magnitude.

## \<h2\> Leveling Features 

**Ability & Power Boost:** Increase any of your ability scores by 1 and
increase any of your power scores by 1; any points above your rank cap
are considered untapped potential.

**Ability Boost:** Increase one of your ability scores by 1; any points
above your rank cap are considered untapped potential.

**Rank Increase:** Increase your rank by 1. This increases your rank
bonus and grit by 1

**Feat:** Choose Feat or increase an ability or power score by 2 or any
two ability scores or power scores by 1; any points above your rank cap
are considered untapped potential.

**Feature:** Choose an Origin Feature

**Power Boost:** Increase all your power scores by 1; any points above
your rank cap are considered untapped potential.

## \<h2\> Rank Cap: Ability and Power Score Caps 

A hero or threat cannot have an ability score or power score higher than
their rank cap, which is equal to 20 + the hero rank x5; for ability
scores, this cap is before power modifications such as improved ability,
and for powers, this cap applies to a powers score including power
modifications.

Ability and Power Score’s final score exceeds this cap; it is capped at
this maximum. Any points above the cap are considered untapped
potential. As you increase in rank, you can utilize the power’s score up
to the new rank cap.

## \<h2\> Campaign Cap 

The editor-in-chief may set a rank cap for the campaign; once you reach
this cap, you simply no longer level. Most campaigns are capped at rank
4 (A-Listers), but again, your editor-in-chief may opt for a higher cap.
Keep in mind that Highly Trained heroes will have a hard time increasing
beyond rank 4; you can always give these heroes an additional Origin,
allowing them to develop new abilities beyond those of a Highly Trained
hero.

### \<h3\> Optional Rule: Retcon

Rotted Capes has a lot of character options, so much so that it’s very
easy for a player to create a hero they are just not happy playing. For
this, we have the Retcon rule: any time before the hero hits Alpha level
9, they can change their character’s ability scores and powers by going
back to those steps of hero creation and then applying any leveling
features they may have gained. Don’t allow this if someone is attempting
to game the system; retcon is meant to be a safety net for players new
to the game.

**\</side bar\>**

### \<h3\> Optional Rule: Starting at a higher level.

You may choose to run a higher power game if you do just allow your
players to make a character and improve it though the advancement system
to the starting power classification of your choice (for example rank 2
(Bata) heroes) heroes may learn a power stunt per rank 1. For example, a
rank 3 (Gamma) level hero may start playing with 3 power stunts. You are
still acquired to take the feat, master power stunt, to master a power
stunt.
