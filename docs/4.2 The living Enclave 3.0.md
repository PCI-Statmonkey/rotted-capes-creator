# \<H1\> The Living Enclave

Rotted capes is more than about punching zombies, it’s a story about survival, and the lives of those whom the heroes are fighting to protect. Your enclave is more than just a base of operations to start your missions from; it’s a living, breathing part of the story meant to be just as important as your excursions into the outside world.

Your enclave has unique characteristics, with ranks kept in secret by the Editor-in-Chief. Your actions in-game and in between during *Enclave Interludes* alter these scores, shaping the enclave’s culture and your hotel’s accommodations.

### \<h3\> Enclaves characteristics

**Cohesion** (moral, unity): Cohesion reflects the collective unity, trust, and emotional resilience of the enclave’s members. It measures how well the survivors work together under pressure, resolve disputes, and maintain hope in the face of the apocalypse. High Cohesion allows the community to act as one, supporting heroes in crises and reducing infighting. As survivors lose faith or factions emerge, Cohesion falters, making cooperation harder and risking fragmentation.

**Resources** (food, supplies, energy): Resources represent the enclave’s material abundance and stability, including food, water, power, and critical supplies. A strong Resources rating means the enclave can endure shortages, keep its Facilities operational, and provide heroes with what they need to succeed. As Resources dwindle, the community is forced to ration, Facilities shut down, and desperation sets in, making survival and recovery increasingly difficult.

**Security**: Security measures the enclave’s ability to defend itself against external threats. It encompasses fortifications, surveillance, concealment, and the vigilance of its guards. Strong Security keeps zombies, raiders, and rival factions at bay, buying the heroes time to act. As Security erodes, breaches become more frequent, attacks more dangerous, and fear more pervasive, threatening the enclave’s very existence.

**\<h3\> Facilities**   
In addition to the three characteristics above, your enclave can have any number of *facilities.*

Facilities give you something exceedingly rare in the post-apocalyptic world of rotted capes, a safe place to apply your skills with all the tools and resources you have in one organized place. Facilities enable you to utilize *Enclave Interludes*, the downtime between issues, to apply your skill sets in ways not possible in the outside world.   
  
Facilities are what make Enclave Interludes possible. Between Issues, during downtime, heroes can engage in Enclave Interludes to apply their Skill Sets in ways that aren’t possible while scavenging through ruined streets or fighting for their lives.

Different facilities provide tangible benefits tied to specific Skill Sets or narrative features. For example, a short-wave radio room grants your enclave the ability to reach out and communicate with other enclaves, expanding your options for trade, diplomacy, and alliances. A Tactical Room, lined with city maps and marked with the intel you’ve gathered from countless missions, lets your team plan their next foray into the city with precision.

Some enclaves will already have a number of facilities in place when play begins, while others might be little more than a fortified shell, leaving it to the heroes to build, expand, and upgrade as the campaign unfolds. Facilities have ranks of their own, just like enclaves, representing their condition, level of sophistication, and capacity. Unlike the overall ranks of the enclave itself, whose true scores are kept hidden by the Editor-in-Chief, a hero can usually determine the rank of a facility after spending some time working on or inspecting it with an appropriate Skill Set.

## \<H2\> Enclave Events

At the start of every issue, the Editor-in-Chief checks to see if an unusual incident occurred in the enclave. The significance of these occurrences varies, ranging from minor instances that are lightly addressed to major subplots that develop into independent storylines. Enclave events may present new challenges, opportunities, or dilemmas that affect the community.

## \<H2\> An Enclave in Crisis

Certain situations might push an enclave into a crisis. These crises can arise from fluctuations in characteristic scores during gameplay. For example, if you rescue a group of survivors and boost the enclave’s population beyond the hotel’s ability to feed them, or if an attempt to increase the hotel’s energy score fails dramatically, a crisis unfolds. During these crises, random event table rolls are bypassed, and the crisis itself might even become the central focus of the upcoming session.

When these events take place, you are given a limited timeframe to resolve the crisis. Failure to do so has consequences. For instance, if you cannot address the crisis in a timely manner, the enclave's morale and unity may deteriorate. People could go hungry due to the hotel’s inability to support new arrivals, or they might endure hardships stemming from a damaged energy source.  
  
Crises are resolved through narrative play and creative challenges, tailored to what the enclave is facing. Repairing a power grid, calming a panicked crowd, fortifying defenses, negotiating peace, these are moments for heroes to step up and make hard choices. When a hero’s backstory or unique experience comes into play, it can become a defining moment of their story.

## \<H2\> Enclave Interludes

Between Issues, heroes may engage in Enclave Interludes, narrative downtime where you step away from the front lines to focus on your personal goals, your community, and the long-term survival of your enclave. These quiet, deliberate moments are just as much a part of being a hero as punching zombies or fending off raiders.

During an Interlude, you can put your training and ingenuity to work in ways the chaos of the outside world doesn’t allow. You might train bystanders to help shoulder the burden of defense, shore up failing infrastructure, negotiate with neighboring factions, or pursue personal projects like occult research, crafting new technologies, or piecing together lost parts of your own identity.

The needs of the enclave should help guide your priorities. If danger looms, you might focus on Security: bolstering the walls, organizing militias, or reinforcing choke points. If times are calm, you might work to expand the enclave’s Resources by cultivating trade, scrounging supplies, or improving morale through events and outreach. Every choice you make here has consequences, weaving into the ongoing story and shaping the community you protect.

Below is a list of common Interlude activities, but it’s far from exhaustive. As with everything in Rotted Capes, creativity and collaboration between player and Editor-in-Chief are encouraged. Every Interlude can yield one of two kinds of benefits to the enclave. Temporary benefits are quick fixes or stopgaps, often accomplished in a single session, that improve an enclave characteristic for just the next Issue. Permanent benefits are longer-term, requiring commitment across multiple Interludes to raise a characteristic or facility rank permanently. How long it takes, and what it requires, is intentionally flexible.

***\<h3\>Sample Enclave Interlude Activities**

**Training:** You spend your time training bystanders, which can result in increased resources, security, or cohesion.

**Hunt & Scavenge:** You venture out into the wasteland to search for valuable supplies, equipment, or materials to benefit the enclave. Requires Skill Sets such as *Outdoorsman*, *Urban Forager*, *Survivalist,* or similar.

**Enclave Maintenance**: You dedicate time and effort to repairing and maintaining the enclave's infrastructure and defenses, ensuring its stability and security. Can involve Skill Sets like *Engineer*, *Technophile*, and *Academic*.

**Community Building:** You engage in activities that foster camaraderie and morale among the enclave's residents, such as organizing events, providing entertainment, or offering counseling services. Utilize skill sets such as *Performer, Counselor,* and *Team Leader.*

**Trade and Diplomacy:** You work to establish connections with other enclaves or factions, negotiating trade agreements and alliances or resolving conflicts diplomatically. Relevant Skill Sets include *Law Enforcement Crisis Negotiator*, *Trader*, and *Former UN Ambassador*.

**Exploration and Reconnaissance:** You can explore uncharted areas, map out the surroundings, and gather information about potential threats or valuable resources. Skill Sets such as *Military Ranger* and *Survivalist* are useful.

**Research and Development:** heroes with scientific or technical skills can work on developing new technologies, medicines, or enhancements that benefit the enclave. See *Building the Impossible* below.

**Intel Gathering:** You can gather intelligence on rival factions, potential threats, or hidden dangers, providing valuable data for future missions or decision-making. Any number of skill sets can be used here; this is a great way for the editor-in-chief to sprinkle in future plots. Successful challenges result in you stating the next issue with an extra plot point.

**Special Missions:** You can undertake specific missions or quests that directly impact the enclave's well-being, such as rescuing captured residents, securing vital resources, or eliminating dangerous threats. This activity is more like preparing for a side mission, rather than the mission itself; perhaps you scout an area to gather information or work to convince members of the enclave to allow the mission in the first place.

**Recovering/Reconstructing lost equipment:** There are times when you may lose access to one of your powers with the *Removable Item* power modification. In these cases, with the editor’s permission, you may use multiple Enclave Interludes to reconstruct your lost item. Techno-heroes can recover a single item with just the use of one Enclave Interlude or two items if they have access to a working facility.

**Establish a Facility:** Work with the Editor-in-Chief to propose a “shopping list” of resources and steps needed to build or improve a facility. Expect some curveballs, no plan survives first contact with reality, but you’ll get there.

**Restocking a medical kit:** Replenish medical supplies to keep your enclave ready for the inevitable injuries. The more advanced the kit, the more challenging it is to restock fully, but it could make all the difference in a future crisis.

## \<h2\> Building the Impossible (Or at Least Improbable)

When you’ve got an enclave full of heroes, bystanders, a handful of people who actually know which end of a wrench to hold, and just enough free time between zombie attacks, someone is bound to say: *“Hey… you know what we really need around here? A teleport pad.”*

And honestly? Why not.

So, how does it work?

It all starts with an idea, something you want to build. Don’t worry about making it realistic, that’s the Editor-in-Chief’s job. You say what you want if it’s something simple, a new water pump, a stockpile of bandages, maybe a couple of reinforced doors, that can usually be wrapped up in a single interlude without much fuss. But if what you’re asking for is a little more… ambitious? Like a functioning teleporter or a swarm of drones that watch over the city, well, now we are talking.

When you pitch an idea like that, you’ll need to put together what we call a *Shopping List*. This is just you and the rest of the table throwing out ideas for what it would take. What parts, what people, what weird alien crystals, what impossible power cores you’re going to scrounge up? Go big. Go weird. Have fun with it!

Once you’ve got your list, the Editor-in-Chief will turn it into a *Blueprint*. The Blueprint is the real plan, filled out with the things you didn’t think of, balanced against what resources you actually have, and maybe some complications to keep you on your toes.

From there? It’s up to you. It will take several in-game tasks as well as a string of skill set challenges. Maybe you’re a Garage Engineer with an Edge for repurposing alien tech. Maybe you’re a Scavenger who knows every abandoned factory in a five-mile radius. Maybe you’re just someone who doesn’t know how to quit. Whatever it is, you sell it to the Editor-in-Chief and roll your Skill Set Challenge.

Don’t be afraid to lean on your Edges. And if your idea ties into something deeply personal, your backstory, your defining traits, something only you could’ve thought to bring to the table, then you might trigger a Deep Cut Moment and earn yourself a little bonus for making the scene that much better.

Now, common stuff can be built in one interlude, no problem. But the bigger the idea, the more time it’ll take, sometimes an entire issue or longer. Also, the bigger the idea, the more likely it’ll come with a few downsides. A teleporter it’s just not portable and requires 48 hours to recharge. Those drones? Ya, they require a dozen recharge pads around the city that need regular maintenance. The point is: these aren’t just toys to strap to your belt and carry into the next scene. These are stories that shape the enclave and the world around you, and they leave a mark.
