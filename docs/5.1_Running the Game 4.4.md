# \< h1\> Running a Rotted Capes Game

## Awarding Levels 

Rotted Capes opens the door to many styles of play. You might lean into a campy, power-fantasy romp where the heroes kick Z’s ass and save the day. Or you can crank up the horror and have the heroes struggle against overwhelming odds, fighting to survive one issue at a time. You can even frame it as a gritty survival game, where every resource and every choice matters. Heck, you can change things up mid issue, that’s all part of the fun.

Rotted Capes is designed to be a low-powered game, with heroes relying on their wits as much as, if not more so, than their powers. *The default method has the Heroes advancing in level at the end of every issue*. While this may sound fast, the power level increases are minimal; as such power level increases very slowly.

### Optional Alternative Advancement Options: 

**Story Arc:** Instead of tying advancement to the number of issues completed. You can instead grant a level roughly in the middle of a story arch and one more level at the completion of the volume.

**Number of Issues:** As your players play, several issues will be needed to gain a level. Players all gain a survivor level after the first issue played; their next level comes after playing every 2 issues after that.

### Advancement and Sidekicks

If a player has a sidekick, the Sidekick advances at the same pace as their main hero.

## PLOT TWIST!: What can the Editor-in-Chief do with Plot Points? 

As the Editor-in-Chief, we have the power to use Plot Points just like the players do. Sure, as the Editor-in-Chief, we already have the ability to bend and break the rules to tell a better story, but using the players' spent Plot Points just adds to the moment.

But here's the thing, you don't always have to be the bad guy with Plot Points. Embrace the "rule of cool" and surprise your players with some epic moments! You can use a Plot Point to alter the scene, even if you could have done it anyway. Spending YOUR Plot Point adds an extra performative punch. It's all about creating an atmosphere at the table that makes everyone go, "Whoa! Heck ya"

Oh, and here's another tip: use awarding Plot Points to drop hints or give the players a nudge in the right direction. It's like your secret tool to guide them through the story without giving away too much. So get creative, let those plot points fly, and don't be greedy about handing them out.

###  Tag Lines, Personality Flaws, and Treats 

While you **don't gain** Plot Points from utilizing a villain’s Tag Lines and Personality Flaws, these are still invaluable tools for roleplaying your villains. A well-placed tagline can significantly enhance a scene.

## Adjudicating Power Stunts 

Power stunts offer players creative and cunning ways to utilize their abilities, providing a wide range of possibilities to enhance their characters' capabilities. As the editor-in-chief, you play a crucial role in overseeing and regulating power stunts, which can significantly impact the flow of your campaign.

**Player Creativity and Approval**

- Players propose a power stunt and discuss it with you.

<!-- -->

- Some powers may have pre-listed power stunts, offering potential abilities or duplications of other powers without requiring those specific powers. These pre-listed power stunts are available options to characters possessing those powers, but players are not limited to those stunts alone.

**\<side bar\>**

**Optional Rule: Other sources of power stunts**

Comic books and shows based on comics are a great source of power stunts; if a player can show you an example of a power stunt from a published comic book or animated film, give them one free, successful use of the power stunt.

**\</side bar\>**

**Determining Stunt Feasibility**

- When facing situations outside the suggested power stunts or character listings, you, the Editor, determine the possibility of the stunt. As a rule, power stunts should never surpass the effects of the derived power, or if they do, they do so at a lower score. Remember, emulated powers are emulated at -6 of the parent power's power score.

**Using Power Checks for Stunts**

- Once a power stunt is determined to be possible, the player is required to spend a plot point and roll a successful power check to perform the power stunt. They may use an additional plot point to gain Advantage on this power check.

| Number of successful attempts | DC  |
|-------------------------------|-----|
| 0                             | 20  |
| 1-2                           | 18  |
| 3-4                           | 16  |
| 5-6                           | 14  |
| 7-8                           | 12  |
| 9-10                          | 10  |

- The player rolls their power check against a DC set by the number of successful attempts the hero has had with a particular power stunt.

  - A successful role, the Hero pulls off the power stunt and gets one successful attempt.

  - A failed roll by 5 or less, the Hero still takes burnout but fails in their attempt, but they know it's possible.

  - A failed attempt by 10 or more, the Hero still takes burnout and is left in doubt that the stunt is even possible, they also suffer Disadvantage on their next check to attempt this power stunt.

### Skill Challenges, telling the story 

Skill Sets are designed to provide players with a mechanical framework that encourages them to engage with the story, allowing them to get creative in how they justify their interactions with the scene, and fostering a bit of storytelling along the way.

Challenges replace dry skill checks with opportunities to tell the story *together*, whether through triumph or dramatic failure. They are not just about rolling the dice (yes, that’s part of the fun), they are about creating cinematic moments that push the narrative forward.

**So, what makes a good Challenge?** Great challenges don’t sound like challenges at all; they are just you describing the scene and opening the narrative door to the players. Sometimes, a “so, what do you do?” might be needed, but once you set the table, it’s time for the players to take part.

Let them tell you how they interact with the scene. Once they do, if they have not told you already, ask, “So, how are you going to do that?”  
  
That question invites them to justify their actions through their Skill Sets and abilities. It keeps the moment grounded in the story and helps everyone stay immersed. Don’t lead them to an answer; let them pitch their approach to you. If it makes sense in the fiction, roll with it. If it’s clever or dramatic, even better, reward it.

###  Failure is an option, well, until it is. 

Failure is not the end of the challange, it’s a new twist. Maybe the door is unlocked, but now an alarm is blaring. Maybe the mob calms down… but someone slips away to spread rumors. Failure adds drama, tension, and creates new opportunities.  
  
Sometimes when failure happens, give the players a chance to describe the twist, allowing them to invest in the story and tell the rest of the party what happened, and reward them with a plot point when they really “embrace the suck”.  
  
Also, remember that a player can always willingly fail to meet a challenge; if it makes for a good story, they get a plot point.

### Example: A Good Challenge in Play

The players are attempting to cross an old suspension bridge at night in order to reach another part of the city. You describe the scene:

*The cables groan under the weight of the wind and the years. Parts of the deck are missing entirely, and in the distance, the images of zombies reflect off the water below. The smell of rust and rot fills the air. What do you do?*

One player says, “I’ll lead the way across, testing each panel before stepping on it.”

You nod. *“Okay…. and how are you going to do that?”*

They answer: *“I’m using my Urban Explorer Skill Set, watching for signs of weakness in the structure and feeling with my feet for loose boards. I’ll use Wisdom to trust my instincts about what’s safe.”*

That’s perfect. You set the Difficulty based on the wind and age of the bridge, maybe 15 for a routine Challenge.

They roll and fail. But instead of saying “you fall,” you lean into the drama:

*You hear a loud crack and feel the panel shift under your weight. You barely catch yourself, but the noise echoes out into the night. Across the river, you hear groans as the zombie horde stirs to life and starts moving toward the bridge.*

Failure didn’t stop the story; it escalated it. A good Challenge sets the tone, gives the player agency, and creates a new twist to deal with.

##  Dramatic Sequence

Dramatic Sequences are a narrative-driven way to present a string of challenges that allow players to engage in tense situations where their skills and abilities play a crucial role in determining the outcome. Dramatic Sequences are used to simulate complex tasks, dynamic scenes, and dramatic moments that require the heroes to meet multiple challenges to succeed.

**Initiating a Dramatic Sequence**

- First, as the editor-in-chief, introduce the Dramatic Sequence when the survivor faces a situation that involves multiple obstacles or objectives to overcome. Describe the scene, set the stakes, and lay out the goals that the heroes must achieve. But don't just tell them which skill sets to use; let the players figure that out; it's part of the challenge, allowing them to think outside the box.

**Challenges during a Dramatic Sequence**

- During a Dramatic Sequence, players describe their hero’s actions and propose the Skill Sets and Abilities they want to use to tackle the scene’s goals.

<!-- -->

- You set the Difficulty Class (DC) for each Challenge, representing how hard it is to succeed. Feel free to adjust DCs based on creativity or clever use of Skill Sets and reward smart play.

- Each successful Challenge “unlocks” the next stage of the sequence.

- A good Dramatic Sequence typically requires no more than three successful Challenges, though longer sequences are possible if the pacing stays tight and engaging. Too many will bog down the story.

**Collaboration and Teamwork:**

- Heroes can help each other instead of rolling individually. Encourage players to justify how they’re helping and let everyone contribute to the scene, even if they’re not making the main rolls. Assisted heroes gain Advantage on their Challenge roll. You can always choose to lower the DC as well, depending on how many heroes are assisting and the quality of their assistance.

**Consequences of Failure and Failing Forward:**

Dramatic Sequences are designed to emphasize the impact of failure, leaning into the concept of "failing forward," where even unsuccessful checks can lead to interesting and dramatic outcomes.Failing forward guarantees that even in the face of failure, the story progresses, and the players remain engaged. The consequences of failure become part of the ongoing narrative, offering opportunities for new challenges and unexpected twists.

When taking part in a Dramatic Sequence, heroes may encounter various consequences if they fail to achieve the required number of successful checks. Here are some examples of how failure can shape the narrative:

- **Setbacks and Complications:** The heroes trigger alarms, attract enemies, or set off traps that escalate the danger.

- **Time Constraints:** The sequence becomes more urgent, adding a ticking clock or shrinking window of opportunity.

- **Resource Depletion:** Ammunition, medical supplies, or other resources are burned up, forcing players to improvise.

- **Revisiting Successes:** The heroes might have to repeat or undo a previously successful step.

- **Partial Success:** They don’t achieve the full goal, but gain something — a clue, a hidden route, or an edge for the next attempt.

- **New Obstacles or Enemies:** Their failure attracts additional threats, reinforcements, or triggers an unexpected escalation.

- **Compromised Cover or Stealth:** If they were trying to remain hidden, failure blows their cover and makes things harder.

###  Example: Dramatic Sequence in Play

The heroes are trying to evacuate a group of civilians from a collapsing hospital while keeping them calm and avoiding the Super-Z prowling the lower floors. You describe the scene:

*The hospital groans under its own weight, ceiling tiles falling and lights flickering. A crowd of terrified survivors huddles in the stairwell, and from somewhere below you hear the low roar of something inhuman. The smell of smoke and dust fills the air. You’ve got to get these people out before the whole place comes down. What do you do?*

**Stage 1: Calm the Crowd**

One player, playing Apparition, steps forward.

*“I’ll calm them down and get them listening before they stampede or freeze up. Using my Ex-Law Enforcement Skill Set with Charisma to project calm authority and take charge.”*

You nod. *“Alright, DC 15 to cut through the panic and get them moving.”*

She rolls, succeeds. The crowd settles, looking to her for instructions.

### Stage 2: Scout the Route

The next player, playing Zero, speaks up.

*“I’ll dart ahead and scout the route to make sure it’s clear, using Urban Explorer with Wisdom to avoid debris and listen for the Super-Z.”*

You set the DC higher here, to DC 18, due to the noise and the unstable building. He rolls and succeeds, spotting a safe route through the west wing before the creature can cut them off. He signals for the group to follow.

### Stage 3: Keep the Path Open

Finally, Arch-lightinng chimes in.

*“I’ll stay behind the group and clear debris out of the way to keep the path open, using Strength and my Construction Worker Skill Set.”*

This time the roll fails, but instead of stopping the scene, you lean into *failing forward*:

*“You heave a heavy beam out of the way just as the stairwell collapses behind you, but the crash echoes through the halls. Below, the roar of the Super-Z gets louder as it zeroes in on your group. You’ve bought time, but it’s now chasing you.”*

The team successfully evacuates the survivors, but their failure on the last stage escalates the danger for the next scene, keeping the tension high and the narrative moving.

###  Social Challenges 

In the post-apocalyptic world of Rotted Capes, social encounters can be as impactful, if not more so, than battle against a super Z. Heroes will be dealing with other enclaves, lone wolf survivors, and their supporting cast, all with their own motivations.

Rewarding good roleplaying and the use of Skill Sets in social encounters requires some balance. Some players thrive in character, delivering impressive monologues or impassioned speeches. Others are less socially outgoing and prefer to lean on their hero’s Skill Sets, describing their intended outcome, their motivations, or crafting a logical argument to justify their approach. Both are equally valid ways to play, and both deserve to shine.

Some players will lean harder on their Skill Sets and mechanics; others will lean harder on their improvisation and acting. Encourage both, and reward creativity and investment wherever it comes from.

**When to Call for a Social Challenge**

Not every social encounter needs a roll. If the players present an irrefutable argument or the Heroes share the same goals as those they are interacting with, proceed with the story. Social Challenges should come into play when the Heroes' motivations and the people they are interacting with are in conflict, when logical arguments are insufficient, and when emotions are running high.  
  
**Balancing Roleplay and Skill Sets**

> Even in social scenes, remember: the fiction comes first. Encourage players to justify their approach using their Skill Sets and a relevant Ability.

For example:

*“I’m using my Community Organizer Skill Set with Charisma to rally the crowd to our side.”*

or

> *“I’m leaning on my Silver-Tongued Scoundrel Skill Set with Intelligence to convince them this plan is in their best interest.”*
>
> Reward strong roleplay, but don’t penalize players who prefer to describe rather than perform — let their Skill Sets carry them if that’s their style.

**Situational Modifiers in Social Challenges**

Below is a handy list of situational modifiers you can use to adjust Challenges during a social encounter. This is not exhaustive, and you should always consider the fiction and tone of the scene. And remember: sometimes, even the most persuasive hero can’t convince someone, you can’t talk a frightened bystander into holding a door against a charging Super-Z.

##  Time and Recovery 

Rotted Capes doesn’t track time in minutes, hours, or days. Time moves by panels, by pages, by the turn of the story. Just like in a comic book, what matters isn’t how long something takes on a clock, it’s when the tone shifts, when the focus moves, when the narrative demands a new beat.

Although these units feel narrative in nature, they serve a hard mechanical purpose: the recovery of resources depending on the time passed.

###  Scenes

A scene is a distinct narrative moment focused on a single conflict, goal, or location. A fight in a parking garage is a scene. Negotiating a truce between two factions? Another scene. As soon as the action shifts, combat ends, the heroes change locations, or the stakes transform, the scene ends, and a new one begins.

Scenes are **THE** foundation of the game’s pacing. Bunout, flaws, features, and some powers refresh when a new scene begins. A scene doesn’t care how much time has passed in-universe; it's about the story beat, the page turn.

When in doubt, treat any clear narrative shift as the start of a new scene.

###  Hiatus

A Hiatus is more than just a pause… It’s genuine downtime. Sleep. Shelter. A secure space to let your guard down. A Hiatus usually happens between scenes or might be a scene in itself, such as camping overnight in a tall building looking over the dark, quiet city below.

During a Hiatus, heroes recover all their stamina, some conditions, such as exhaustion, as well as all features recovered after completing a scene.

\<sidebar\>

###  Optional Rule: Brutal Continuity, Healing

For groups who want a darker, more punishing game, the Editor-in-Chief may enable Brutal Continuity.

In Brutal Continuity, Burnout is not automatically cleared at the end of a scene. Instead, it is reduced by 5 points. Any remaining Burnout can only be cleared by taking a Hiatus. Likewise, Stamina does not recover at the end of a scene; it only comes back during a Hiatus. This optional rule makes survival feel heavier and risk more permanent. It’s not for every campaign, but when you want the heroes to feel like they’re one bad decision away from collapse, it hits the tone perfectly.

Brutal Continuity works well in early-stage campaigns, horror arcs, or storylines where recovery is scarce. Every retreat feels earned. And when a hero finally rises to face the odds again, it means something.

\</sidebar\>

###  Enclave Interludes

Between Issues, when the smoke clears and the next crisis hasn’t yet begun, heroes may engage in an Enclave Interlude. These are the narrative lulls in the series, days or weeks spent within the safety of their hotel or hideout, focused on long-term goals, personal growth, and keeping their community alive.

During an Enclave Interlude, heroes can train allies, craft new gear, pursue research, or shape the direction of the enclave. This is when they fix generators, train bystanders, plot new alliances, and follow through on personal arcs. Interludes can be quiet or dramatic. They may grant temporary benefits to the next Issue, or if pursued over time, lead to permanent upgrades to Facilities, new capabilities, or even the acquisition of new feats and powers.

This is where the world breathes. This is where the story slows down just long enough to show what the heroes are fighting for. Editors should use Interludes to spotlight character development, shape future storylines, and ground the drama in something worth saving.

##  Running Hazards

### Contaminated Food and Water 

There will be times when heroes encounter contaminated supplies. A hero may attempt to avoid illness by making a Constitution-based ability check, applying a relevant Skill Set such as *Outdoorsman*, *Urban Forager*, or similar, at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion. Contaminated food and water can cause damage over time or impose Conditions such as *Exhaustion*, *Blindness*, or *Weakened*

These encounters are not meant to be “gotcha” traps. If the players are diligent about checking food and cleaning water, let them know they've avoided possible contamination on occasion to acknowledge their smart play.

### Disease 

An aspect rarely touched upon in the classic superhero genre is that of disease, but not so in *Rotted Capes*. Although the threat of being infected by the Z-Virus is a constant, it's not the only disease the Heroes have to worry about.

At the onset of the disease, roll an attack against the survivor's *Fortitude.* If it successfully hits, the target is infected and suffers the initial effects of the disease. After the allotted amount of time, the survivor must perform a Constitution Saving Throw against that disease stage's DC; a failed roll advances the victim to the next stage of infection, and so on. A successful Saving Throw moves the target up the track; if the target succeeds in his Saving Throw against the initial infection, he shakes off the disease.

Infection tracks can be 2 to 4 levels in length; the survivor only suffers damage from any particular stage of infection once and may not heal damage dealt by a disease until cured. Lastly, some diseases may require a specific cure, in which case a target cannot shrug off the disease and remains in the initial infection state until the cure is administered.

Players may add Plot Points to gain Advantage on their saving throw against a disease.

**Word on Antibiotics:** While most antibiotics have lost much of their potency in the years following Z-Day, they remain highly useful. If a survivor has access to antibiotics when attempting to fight off a disease, they gain a +5 bonus to their Saving Throws.

#### Contaminated Food / Water Poisoning (Disease)

Foodborne illnesses, of which there are many, are the most common diseases suffered after Z'day. When any creature consumes contaminated food, it may experience the following consequences.

**Attack:** +5 (Fortitude)

**Resistance:** Challenging (DC: 15)

**Infection Track:**

- *<u>Initial infection (1 day):</u>* The victim starts to suffer stomach pains and gains 1 level of Exhaustion.

- *<u>Advanced stage (2 days):</u>* The victim starts having fits of vomiting, and the victim gains an additional level of Exhaustion. Additionally, during a scene, the editor-in-chief may call for a DC: 20 Constitution Saving Throw; if they fail this Saving Throw, they are *Stunned (Lesser)* and start to vomit. At the end of each of their turns, they can make a new saving throw to end this effect. Alternatively, the Survivor can instantly resist by using a plot point.

- *<u>Final stage (2 Days):</u>* The situation has become untenable; the victim suffers an additional level of Exhaustion and can not hold down food or water. They are prone and restrained and suffer 1 wound of damage at the beginning of each day. At the end of every day, they may make a new Saving throw to move up 1 stage. If they do, they are out of danger, and each day move up an additional stage.

#### Gangrene, Dry (Disease)

Gangrene is a serious condition that arises when a considerable mass of body tissue dies. Gangrene has become a leading cause of death, only surpassed by zombie attacks.

Any time a survivor suffers a Wound of damage and does not later clean and bandage it, there is a chance the Wound gets infected.

**Attack:** +6 (Fortitude)

**Resistance:** Challenging (DC: 20)

**Infection Track:**

- *<u>Initial infection (2 days):</u>* The victim's skin starts to harden around the Wound and begins to smell like almonds; the victim suffers 2d6 Stamina.

- *<u>Advanced stage (2 days):</u>* The victim starts to lose all feeling around the original Wound; the smell becomes quite noticeable at this stage. The victim suffers 1 Wound.

- *<u>Final stage (2 Days):</u>* The infection has started to reach the bloodstream; alas, it's only a matter of time. The victim suffers 2 Wounds and is *Restrained (Immobilized).* If he fails his next Saving Throw, the victim dies.

**Optional effects of contaminated food or water:** Instead of death, the editor-in-chief can have the victim go blind or suffer some other permanent effect, such as a reduction to their base pace or penalty to saving throws to resist future infection, "having a soft stomach."

#### The Z-Virus 

Whenever a survivor receives a Wound from a zombie's bite or natural (physical) melee attack (like claws), there is a chance of infection.

The Z-virus functions like any other disease, with a few notable exceptions. First, the virus is 100% resistant to all known antiviral drugs. Second, the disease's initial attack gains a bonus, and Resistance DC is based on the victim's condition at the time of possible infection.

- +2 for each Wound currently being suffered by the creature.

- +4 if the creature is knocked unconscious due to Stamina damage.

- +4 if the creature is a Superhuman with any inborn power above a score of 20.

**Attack:** +10 (Fortitude)

**Resistance:** Challenging (DC: 20)

**Infection Track:**

- <u>Initial infection (1 Hour):</u> The skin around the initial Wound is surrounded by an ash-white patch. Although a normal victim does not suffer any damage at this stage, Superhumans will start to feel lightheaded and gain 1 level of Exhaustion.

- <u>Incubation Stage (2 hours):</u> The ash-white patch upon the victim's skin starts to spread as the Wound itself becomes painfully dry. The victim suffers 2d10 Stamina and gains 1 level of Exhaustion

- <u>Advanced stage (1 day, or 3 hours if superhuman):</u> The victim starts to lose all feeling around the original Wound. Normal victims now suffer 1 Wound, while Superhumans suffer 2 Wounds.

- <u>Final stage (2 Days):</u> The infection has reached its final stage; if the victim is not dead, they are now.

**Death and the Z-Virus:** If a victim is killed by the Z-Virus or killed while infected by the Z-Virus, they rise 1 turn later as a Zombie. Superhumans rise as Super-Zombies under Editor-in-Chief control.

**Cure and Treatment:** This affliction attacks at the cellular level, so amputation is an effective cure. Amputation, however, leaves one particularly vulnerable in a zombie apocalypse, so most victims opt for the almost as effective alternative: burning.

During the Initial and Incubation stages, the victim may opt to burn the Wound in an attempt to stop the disease from spreading. If they do so, they suffer a Wound from the initial burn but gain a second Saving Throw with Advantage. If they succeed at this roll, the infection is killed, with any accumulated penalties fading with proper healing within 24 hours.

### Weather

You will notice that no hard and fast rules are presented here, as the weather can serve as a powerful narrative tool and be effectively used in the telling of the story. Use weather to reinforce the post-apocalyptic atmosphere and create opportunities for great storytelling.

Weather, like powers, possesses an ability score, which measures the intensity of the event. For example, hurricane-force winds would be equivalent to moving an object of 30, with a +10 bonus to power checks, and a passive power DC of 20.

**Acid Rain (Energy Generation: Acid):** The skies darken, and acidic precipitation falls upon the survivors' enclave. For each round spent in the open, Heroes must make a Constitution Saving Throw to resist the corrosive effects.

**High Winds (Move Object):** Our heroes find themselves battered by powerful gusts. For each round spent in the open, Survivors must make a Strength Saving Throw or become prone or shoved into an adjacent area. High Winds can also carry harmful debris, causing damage or imposing penalties on pace and ranged attacks.

**Electrical Storm (Energy Bolt: Electricity):** A violent storm engulfs the skies, accompanied by crackling lightning and booming thunder. Survivors caught in the open are at risk of being struck by lightning, taking significant damage, or suffering debilitating effects.

**Blinding Sandstorm (Move Object, Secondary effect: Blindness):** An immense sandstorm whips across the landscape, creating a hostile environment where visibility is reduced to mere feet. Survivors must make Navigation checks to avoid becoming disoriented or lost. The sandstorm can also carry harmful debris, causing damage, slowing your pace, and hindering ranged attacks.

**Freezing Cold (Energy Generation: Cold):** Bitter cold grips the city, turning survival into a race against frostbite and hypothermia. Survivors must find shelter or protective clothing to stave off the freezing temperatures. Exposure to the cold for prolonged periods can lead to Exhaustion or even death.

**Sweltering Heatwave** **(Energy Generation: Heat):** Intense heat envelops the city. Survivors must manage their hydration and avoid heatstroke, seeking shade and water sources to survive. The heatwave can also heighten tensions among survivors, leading to conflicts and desperate resource competition.

### Holding ones Breath & Underwater Combat

Underwater environments pose unique challenges to survivors, requiring them to navigate both the dangers of combat and the limits of their breath. Here are the rules for holding your breath and underwater combat:

**Holding Your Breath**

- Creatures can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to their Constitution score before needing to make a Constitution saving throw to continue holding it.

- Each round spent holding breath beyond their Constitution score, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw. The DC increases by 2 for each subsequent round.

- If a creature fails the Saving Throw, it begins to suffocate and must make another Saving Throw on its subsequent turns until it can breathe again.

<!-- -->

- Once a creature reaches 0 stamina while suffocating, it falls unconscious and starts taking wound damage, 1 wound every turn it stays submerged in the water. Wounds suffered from suffocation are recovered when the heroes complete a Hiatus.

**Underwater Combat:**

- **Movement:** Creatures with a swim pace can move freely through the water without penalty.

- **Limited Movement:** Creatures without a Swim pace move at half their normal pace while underwater.

- **Range and Attacks:** Ranged attacks made underwater have their range halved unless they have the Aquatic power modification. Melee attacks are unaffected.

- **Visibility:** The visibility underwater is reduced, imposing Disadvantage on wisdom checks to notice things and ranged attacks made beyond a certain distance at the Editor's discretion.

- **Environmental Hazards:** Underwater combat may include hazards like strong currents, pressure, or aquatic creatures. You might be required to meet challenges to swim in difficult conditions.

### Fire & Ice

**Fire:**

Fires, like all other energy sources, would have a power score; you may have controlled flames or flames that are totally out of control; here we are discussing the latter. Areas on fire would have a power score, with the most intense fires receiving a score of 24 to 30 for raging flames. Creatures take the fire's base dice in fire damage any time they start a turn within an area *on fire.* Creatures in adjacent areas suffer half this damage for starting a turn in an area adjacent to an area *on fire.*

Fire, if not controlled, will spread into adjacent areas with combustible materials every turn.

A fire's intensity can be reduced by the use of powers and equipment (a fire extinguisher, for example). These are commonly performed as a skill check or power check against the DC set by the fire’s intensity.

**Effects of fire on materials**  
If a flame's power score is less than the MS of an object, it does not harm the object. The object may still retain its heat. A sword sitting in an open flame may not start immediately melting, but it would burn anyone dumb enough to grab it.

If the flame's power score is greater than that of the MS of the item in question, roll a power check for the fire against a DC equal to the MS of the object in question. If it suffers enough hits, it's broken (see Attacking and Destroying Objects pg XX)

Ice: Ice has an MS per inch as described under Attacking and Destroying Objects, pg XX Powers may create a stronger "more compact" form of ice, in which case, use the power's power score as the ice's MS, requiring the same number of hits as regular ice.

Prolonged exposure to ice and other freezing conditions results in the survivor suffering levels of Exhaustion, commonly one level of Exhaustion for every hour of direct exposure, although extreme temperatures may accelerate this process.

## Optional Rules: Psychosis, the lingering effects of madness

In the bleak world of Rotted Capes, the relentless horrors of the zombie apocalypse can take a toll on the survivors' sanity. These rules introduce a mechanic to reflect the psychological strain and potential descent into madness faced by your players’ heroes.

The following rules represent a gradual descent into madness, with increasingly severe consequences. Please note that this system is not designed to represent real mental illness, as such a system would be far too complex and nuanced and really has no place in a role-playing game.

### Going Mad: A descent into madness. 

When the mind is exposed to unthinkable levels of stress, whether through environmental events, exposure to unimaginable horrors, or mental attacks, it creates fractures in the creature's psyche. Psychosis, much like Exhaustion, is measured in six levels, with each level representing more severe damage to the mind. Anything that can cause madness also grants one or more levels of psychosis.

### Psychosis

| \<b\>Level\</b\> | \<b\>Effect\</b\> | \<b\>Diagnose\</b\> | \<b\>Treating Psychosis\</b\> |
|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | — | 20 | Time, Treatment |
| 2 | Psychotic compulsion | 15 | Time, Treatment |
| 3 | Unstable mind | 14 | Time, Treatment |
| 4 | Permanent psychotic compulsion | 13 | Powers, Treatment |
| 5 | Shattered mind | 12 | Powers, Treatment |
| 6 | Permanent madness | 10 | Temporary Reprieve |

### Gaining levels of Psychosis.

There are several ways to gain levels of Psychosis.

- Any creature that is subject to a critical strike from a power that deals with psychic damage gains 1 level of psychosis. If the target of the power \<i\>*mind control*\</i\>, especially its power stunt \<i\>*modify memory\</i\>* rolls a natural 1 on the Wisdom saving throw, they take one level of psychosis.

- Any effect that gives a creature either a temporary or permanent form of madness also gives 1 or 3 levels of psychosis, respectively.

- Also, effects from things like ancient artifacts, diseases, poisons, and magical effects from alien dimensions can all inflict psychosis.

A creature immune to psychic damage cannot gain further levels of psychosis but retains any levels already possessed. A creature with any resistance to psychic damage gets Advantage on saving throws to resist gaining levels of psychosis.

### The Effects of Psychosis 

As individuals gain levels of psychosis, they suffer the effects noted in the table above, with all effects being cumulative. Levels of psychosis do not dissipate once the duration of a madness effect has passed, but remain, representing the damaged condition of the creature's psyche.

**\<b\>Psychotic Compulsion:\</b\>** These are uncontrollable habits developed by the character. Perhaps the creature develops an uncontrollable chuckle, an irrational fear of snakes, an irrational attachment to a lucky charm, or low-level paranoia. These effects are not meant to be crippling, but rather serve as a role-playing effect. The Editor-in-Chief can require a player to spend a plot point to push past or control their compulsion for an hour. The psychotic compulsion remains until the creature is healed of all levels of psychosis.

***\<b\>Permanent Psychotic Compulsion:\</b\>*** Upon reaching 4 levels of psychosis, the creature gains a psychotic compulsion that can never be removed without the help of powers such as the power stunt from the \<i\>*heal*\</i\> power *\<i\>repair the psyche\</i\>.* If a creature suffering from a permanent psychotic compulsion suffers enough levels of psychosis to gain a psychotic compulsion, it will suffer from both. A creature can suffer multiple permanent psychotic compulsions.

\<bi\>Example of Psychotic Compulsions:\</bi\>

\<Start_Table\>

|  | Roll d10 |
|----|----|
| 1 | Becomes easily agitated by a particular action performed by others. |
| 2 | Becomes easily frustrated by the smallest setbacks. |
| 3 | Compulsive habit (armor must always be shined, sets their table just right before dinner). |
| 4 | Constantly chuckles and mumbles to themself. |
| 5 | They constantly play with their hair or other objects. |
| 6 | Develops an attachment to an object, such as their lucky rabbit's foot. |
| 7 | Develop an irrational fear of something (spiders, for example). |
| 8 | Has especially vivid dreams/nightmares that leave them feeling uneasy. |
| 9 | It gnaws at them when they come across something asymmetrical. |
| 10 | They are plagued by the feeling of déjà vu or the feeling they are being watched. |

\</table\>

**\<b\>Unstable Mind:\</b\>** An interesting side effect of psychosis is the acceptance of things that may fracture more stable minds. Creatures with unstable minds gain a +2 bonus to any saves and defenses to resist any effect that grants madness.

**\<b\>Shattered Mind:\</b\>** individuals that have reached this level of psychosis suffer from an additional \<i\>*psychotic compulsion\<i/\>* and gain a temporary madness effect. Additionally, if you are exposed to any effect that would grant madness, you automatically fail your saving throw to resist it, or in the case of an attack, your willpower is reduced to 10 to resist that attack.

**\<b\>Permanent Madness: \</b\>**The creature suffers from a madness that cannot be cured by any known means.

####  Editor's Option: Tailored Madness Effects 

Core rules provide a random collection of effects, but many times, the Editor may roll a random madness effect that really has little to do with the event that caused the madness. Instead of randomly rolling for random madness, tailor the psychotic compulsion to the individual or to the event that caused the psychological damage in the first place.

\< sidebar\>

####  StatMonkey's Advice: A Different Point of View

Those affected with levels of psychosis possess a different way of seeing the world, as such creatures may come across things that can only be understood by someone with psychosis levels. This can make for interesting puzzles or explain why can understand the “rambling notes of a madman”.

\</side bar\>

### **Diagnosis**

A hero with an appropriate Skill Set (e.g., Combat Medic, Therapist, Occult Scholar) can attempt a Skill Check against the table DC to identify a target’s psychosis level and nature.  
  
When a creature suffering from a psychotic compulsion is observed by a creature with an appropriate Skill Set (e.g., Combat Medic, Therapist, Occult Scholar) they can me asked to meet a challenge against the DC in the chart above to recognize the creature is suffering from a psychotic condition. If the creature surpasses the DC by 5 or more, the creature also determines the levels of psychosis the target creature is suffering from.

### Treating Psychosis

There are three methods of treating psychosis: Time, Treatment, and Powers.

***Time:*** A survivor can use out-of-frame activities to recover from the trauma they faced, requiring a number of Enclave Interudes equal to the level of psychosis they currently possess. Afterward, the creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the levels in psychosis +10, and a successful Saving throw reduces the creature's level of psychosis by one. If the character rolls a 1 on their saving throw, they gain an additional level of psychosis.

***Treatment:*** If the survivor is also receiving Treatment during this process (as in another individual with an appropriate skill using their Enclave Interudes to treat them) they get Advantage on their saving throw to reduce their levels in psychosis.

***Powers:*** A far safer and more assured method of curing psychosis is through the use of the healing power stunt *to heal the psyche; after completing a Hiatus, this power trick can reduce an* individual's psychosis level by 1.

***Temporary Reprieve:*** When a creature reaches 6 levels of psychosis, there is nothing that can be done to cure such a break to its psyche. At this level of damage, powers and treatment can provide only a reprieve from the effects of psychosis. An individual treated with a power or successfully receives treatment and makes their saving throw finds that their indefinite madness is suppressed for 1d4+1 days.

####  Player's Advice: lingering effects 

Being treated is not the end of the story, and as a player, you may choose to have the events that caused you to suffer from psychosis continue to affect you far beyond the time required to recover from it. In literature, many comic Heroes carry the scars of past events, so don't let the removal of levels of psychosis stop you from telling a good story. Recovering from psychosis does not necessarily mean you have forgotten or put those events behind you, as recovering from psychosis can represent a refortification of your psyche against further damage.

### Going Mad 

While there are exterior effects that may inflict a madness effect directly upon an individual (giving them levels of psychosis in the process), the most common way of gaining a madness effect is through the acquisition of levels of psychosis.

##  Madness Effects

Madness can be temporary or permanent.

An individual afflicted with **\<b\>temporary madness\</b\>** gains a madness effect that lasts 1d10 × 10 days; those afflicted with temporary madness can be treated through the use of powers or through receiving treatment during an Enclave Interlude. An afflicted individual only needs one Enclave Interlude while being treated by someone possessing an appropriate skill set (psychologist/counselor) to remove a temporary insanity before the next issue.

An individual afflicted with \<**b\>** **Permanent madness\</b\>** gains a new weakness from a permanent, incurable madness from the table below.

##  Utilizing Resource Scarcity

Rotted Capes does not require detailed resource management; ammo rules are abstract, and we don’t track meals and water precisely. Resource shortages are treated more like a story beat than a hard mechanic. There are countless ways to utilize implied scarcity in your games, but here are just a few.  
  
**Story Hooks:** The most common way to bring resource security to the forefront is by using it as a story hook in your issues. Use it as a way to get your heroes out of the hotel into the streets, where they might stumble upon the story hooks, or the entire focus of the issue might be recovering or discovering resources they need… raiding a hospital in the hopes of stocking up on medical supplies, or going deep into a Z infected area to an old solar panel manufacturing facility, or checking out an old superhero headquarters in the hopes they could find something useful for their enclave.

**Resource as Reward:** Playing into the above, the scarcity of resources provides a way to make rewards more meaningful. When the players complete an issue, reward them with limited supplies, useful equipment, or a cache of ammunition. However, ensure that these rewards feel valuable and earned.

**Trade and Bartering:** Encourage the players to engage in trade and bartering with bystanders from other enclaves or even members of their own. Let them trade their skills or valuable items for items they want.

**Crafting and Improvisation:** Encourage the players to craft their own equipment or improvise tools from available resources during an Enclave Interlude. Doing so can directly benefit them by giving them access to new powers when they get their next feat or as a way for them to affect their enclave’s characteristics. For instance, they can create makeshift weapons, traps, or armor from salvaged materials, improving the hotel’s security characteristics.

## The Cast

The cast is a collection of survivors controlled by the Editor-in-Chief, rather than one of the players, but this may not always be the case. The cast consists of the survivors your players interact with on a constant basis and is just as much part of the story, if not more so, than the super Zs your players face off against.

In Rotted Capes, the cast is split into three categories: Bystanders, Supporting Cast, and Sidekicks. Bystanders are common survivors that the players will encounter throughout their adventures. They may be scavengers, cultists, or a group of civilians in need of rescue. Bystanders typically have minimal skills, but they can still play an important role in supporting the enclave. They may provide valuable information and resources or serve as an extra set of hands to help with tasks.

Supporting Cast, on the other hand, are highly trained or very useful survivors who are personally connected to one of the players' heroes. These survivors can be family members, friends, or allies. They have their own motivations and goals that may intersect with the players' objectives. Supporting cast members are more fleshed out than bystanders, and they have unique personalities, skill sets, and abilities. They may even have their own story arcs that develop over time.

Lastly, we have the Sidekick. Sidekicks are low-powered heroes who are personally connected to one of the player's heroes and may offer assistance during Issues. While they may not be as skilled or powerful as the heroes, they can still provide valuable support and a unique perspective on the world. Sidekicks are notorious for having a mind of their own and can sometimes be more trouble than they're worth. They may venture outside the enclave on their own or act independently at the most inopportune times, potentially putting themselves and others in danger. Despite their unpredictable nature, many of the heroes in Rotted Capes started as Sidekicks themselves, so taking on a Sidekick can be a way for players to pass on their knowledge and skills to the next generation of survivors. Just make sure they give the heroes a few headaches along the way.  
  
\<side bar\>

#### Word from the Editor: Multiple Sidekicks  
You may very well end up with a party full of sidekicks, which can quickly become a headache for the editor-in-chief. In these cases, only allow one hero to take their Sidekick with them during an issue, and maybe even have the players swap out Sidekicks if the story allows.  
  
Having a lot of Sidekicks can be a LOT of fun if used correctly; maybe they constantly try to one-up each other or get the bright idea to form their own team (unbeknownst to the heroes) and venture out of the enclave. Perhaps you could even have the players play all their sidekicks as part of an issue or swap out their main hero for one of their sidekicks.  
\</side bar\>

###  Using the Cast

The Cast is your best tool to make the world feel alive. Use them to add drama, tension, or levity: a Supporting Cast member’s secret surfacing at the wrong time, a Bystander begging for help in the middle of a battle, or a long-lost loved one stepping out of the crowd.

Let players occasionally control Cast members during split-party scenes, flashbacks, or enclave-side stories. At the same time, the heroes are away, allowing everyone to stay engaged and explore the world from different perspectives.

The right Cast moment can be as memorable as any climactic fight. Don’t waste the opportunity.

### Building your cast 

There are three ways to build out your cast, and as the editor-in-chief, you can build out your cast. Point Buy, Standard Arrays, or grab a simple stat block.

#### Point Buy and Standard Arrays

One of the ways you can build out your cast members is by arranging the following stat arrays, or if you wish to build out some more unique cast members, you can always go with the point buy method.

When using point buy

- Bystander, you cannot start with a common background skill set.

- Supporting cast, use points for a hardened level threat. They have one skill set and one feat.

- Follow the rules for character creation, but replace build points as noted below as if the Sidekick were a Zeta-level threat.

### **Common Background Skill Sets**

These Skill Sets are available to all Bystanders

- **Caretaker** (basic first aid, childcare, community support)

- **Teacher** (history, critical thinking, organizing people)

- **Handyman** (simple repair, tool use, fix-it knowledge)

- **Cook** (meal planning, food preservation, basic chemistry)

- **Custodian** (scavenging, cleaning chemicals, building familiarity)

- **Retail Worker** (bartering, crowd management, survival in chaos)

- **Farmhand** (animal handling, gardening, weather sense)

- **Librarian** (research, knowledge of obscure topics, filing systems)

- **Bus Driver** (vehicle familiarity, basic navigation)

- **Janitor** (lock keys, maintenance shortcuts, problem-solving)

- **Parent** (emotional support, multitasking, comfort)

- **Veteran** *(but not Special Forces)* (basic first aid, discipline, simple tactics, firearms safety)

#### Modifying Stat blocks 

Alternatively, you can choose to pick a common survivor stat block or a hardened survivor stat block, which can be found below in the Adversary Archive chapter. Feel free to modify those stat blocks as you see fit, move around ability scores, change out equipment, or modify skill sets. Don't worry, we won't tell anyone.  
  
\<Sidebar\>

#### You don’t have to stat them all!

Keep in mind you do not have to fully stat out every cast member; in fact, you shouldn't keep some things vague; it gives you flexibility later as you are not tied down to static stats… It's a common trope for the heroes to learn something new about a survivor later in the story.  
  
\</sidebar\>

## Building Encounters

There’s no rigid encounter balancing system in *Rotted Capes*… this is by design. As Editor-in-Chief, it’s your job to read the table, feel the heroes’ capabilities, and craft scenes that challenge them in ways that fit the story. Don’t be afraid to tweak or even rewrite threat stat blocks on the fly. This is as much about cinematic, comic-book drama as it is about crunchy dice rolls and zombie headshots.

Sometimes the heroes should feel over their heads; it's a classic moment in comics. Just make sure they have a chance to win, escape, or pay a meaningful price. If you *do* plan for them to fail? Make it count. Losing the battle makes the eventual comeback that much sweeter.

Threat ranks are loosely inspired by the same danger-level categories used to classify supers before Z-Day. Survivors have adopted them to warn each other about super-zombies and villains lurking out there. Everyone knows to avoid an Alpha-level Z, and you *run* when an Omega-level threat shows up.

Because Rotted Capes intentionally allows heroes to be built with flavor and flexibility, no hard math will ever fit every group. A team of min-maxed powerhouses can plow through encounters that would terrify a more narrative-driven, “flawed” party. As a general guideline:

- A starting-level hero can usually solo a threat **one Rank above** their own.

- A full team of heroes can tackle threats **two to three Ranks above**.

- A skilled, coordinated team might even take down a threat **four Ranks above**, if they play smart and get lucky.

But the sweet spot? Somewhere within two to three Ranks of the team’s level. That’s where most parties will feel tension, and where the win feels earned.

Don’t overthink the math, use the rules to tell a story, lean into it, adjust as needed, and make the fight memorable.

### Threat Creation 

Within the grim panels of Rotted Capes, threats should feel larger than life, or unlife, while remaining fast and easy for the Editor to run. The *Threat Creation System* empowers you, the Editor, to craft cinematic, genre-appropriate challenges.

This system prioritizes Editor-friendliness or static crunchiness, empowering you to create memorable traits that deliver a narrative impact over complex statistics. Every threat, big or small, should feel like a story worth telling.

Use this guide to quickly create balanced, dramatic threats that fit seamlessly into your game.

### How to create a threat 

Creating a threat in Rotted Capes is a straightforward process that allows for some creativity.  
  
**1. Choose the Threat’s Rank**

Decide the threat’s Rank, from Bystander to Omega, based on its narrative role and level of danger. Refer to the Threat Parameters Table (p. XX) for baseline values appropriate to each Rank. Most minor threats fall into Zeta or Epsilon, while major villains or apex predators may climb as high as Beta, Alpha, or beyond.

**2. Reference the Threat Parameters Table**

Use the *Threat Parameters Table* to set the following baseline stats:

- Defenses (Primary / Secondary / Tertiary)

- Attack bonuses

- Stamina and Wounds

- Typical damage output (min–max and average)

These are a recommended starting point; adjust slightly if needed to fit your scene or the threat’s narrative role.

**3. Assign a Role**

Pick a Role (e.g., Bruiser, Controller, Ranged, Minion, Lurker) that defines how this threat behaves in an encounter. Each Role comes with suggested stat tweaks, narrative hooks, and tactics. For example, a Bruiser hits hard and soaks damage, while a Controller specializes in disrupting heroes.

**4. Determine Size**

Decide the threat’s Size (Tiny, Medium, Large, etc.) and apply any relevant modifiers. Larger threats are more imposing, harder to move, and often have extended reach.

**5. Select a Type**

Assign the threat’s Type**,** Origin, Survivor, Animal, Abomination, Construct, etc., which informs its nature, traits, and how powers interact with it.

**6. Add Traits**

Create 2–5 Traits to give the threat personality and mechanical bite. Traits are narrative-forward abilities that make the threat memorable while providing clear mechanical effects.

If you adapt a Power into a Trait, note the Power Score or Rank it represents (so that powers like Mimic or contests can interact with it).

For particularly complex threats, you may also include a simple list of Powers and their Ranks, even if they’re streamlined into Traits for play.

**7. Create Skill Sets**

Create one or two Skill Sets reflecting the threat’s training or instincts. Most threats have a single Skill Set, but highly trained or intelligent (Intelligence 20+) threats may have two or more, if appropriate to the story.

**8. Set Ability Scores**

Assign ability scores that fit the threat’s concept, Rank, and narrative role. There is no single “correct” method; use what works for you and the story.

You can either:

- Start with ability scores that feel right for the threat’s concept, then calculate saves and defenses from them.

- Or start defenses you want the threat to have, and backfill the ability scores to match.

Either approach is valid, as long as the threat’s ability scores remain within its Rank Cap (see Threat Parameters Table) and feel narratively appropriate.

For example, if you want an Epsilon-level threat’s Strength save to be around +7, you might choose Strength 20 (+5) and let the Rank bonus (+2) bring it to +7. Or you could pick the save you want first, then choose a Strength score that supports it.

Stay within Rank Cap limits, keep the numbers reasonable for the threat’s Rank and Role, and focus on what makes the scene exciting.

**9. Apply Templates (Optional)**

If the threat is a Zombie or otherwise mutated, apply the appropriate Template while keeping its original Type and Role. Templates adjust behavior, defenses, and vulnerabilities to match genre expectations.

####  Treat design table value descriptions: 

Remember, these numbers are guidelines, based on the expected progression of the average hero. Feel free to tweak these numbers to fit your party.

**To Hit – Single Target/Area of Effect:** This is your threat's attack bonus; there are two values, one for the threat's single target attack and the other for any area of effect attacks.

**Defenses - Primary/Secondary/Trinary:** This refers to your threat's defenses before the application of a role. Arrange the defenses in a way, or lower any defense, as to best fit the narrative. Don’t min-max, unless your players are…

**Saves - Primary/Secondary/Rest:** These are the saving throw bonuses for your threat, a primary save, a secondary save, and a flat bonus for all remaining ability scores. Again, assigning these values to fit your threat’s narrative feel, a speedster would have dexterity as a primary attribute, while a telepath would have wisdom or charisma, for example.

**Stamina/Wounds:** The Stamina and Wounds for your threat are balanced to allow threats over Zeta to survive 2-3 hits for average damage by a hero of the same rank.

**Damage (Average):** This is the damage range and average damage for single-target attacks. For area-of-effect attacks, use the average damage for an attack 1 rank lower.

\<sidebar\>  
### Advanced Treat Design: Threat Parameters  
While a little more advanced, you can pick and choose rank bonuses, defenses, durability, and attack values from different Ranks in *Table X-X: Threat Parameters* and average them to estimate the threat’s effective Rank. Be careful! Combined with Roles and Traits, you may create a challenge you *think* your heroes can handle, only to discover they’re in over their heads. Always be ready to adjust on the fly.

Refer to chapter 4, page XX, for descriptions and rules regarding creature size.

- **Wounds:** creatures of large size and bigger gain bonus wounds; they are just tougher to bring down.

- **DR:** Larger creatures have thicker skin; as such, they gain a base DR bonus against all damage with the exception of psychic damage, which is added to any DR they may already possess.

- **Reach:** the number of areas a treat can reach due to its size.

####  Treat Types: 

Every threat also has a Type**,** representing its nature and origin. Types help guide narrative decisions and add small adjustments to make each feel distinct. Types are separate from Roles and can be combined freely.

- **Origin:** A powered being, such as a mutant, demigod, mystic, or tech-enhanced individual, some of the heroes are villains, while others are just out for them selves.

- **Abomination:** The result of the Z-virus infecting someone with a recessive ultra-gene, or horrific experimentation gone wrong. Most abominations are grotesque and terrifying, with unstable biology.

- **Animal:** Natural or trained creatures, a trusty dog or horse, or wild creatures such as wolves, big cats, bears, birds, and snakes. Animals have learned to avoid the walking dead and have flourished in a new world with so few humans.

- **Construct:** Mechanical or artificial threats, such as drones, security bots, or animated machinery, are durable and unfeeling, though rare; when encountered, they can present a considerable threat.

- **Survivor:** fellow humans who endure through grit, training, and desperation; some may be raiders, cultists, snipers, or scavengers.

- **Zombies:** This is not limited to the classic mindless brain-eating variety, but also includes “strange” zombies that have developed unusual abilities or are just a little more clever than they have any right to be.

- **Super-Zombie:** The ones to be truly scared of, super zombies are superhumans and demigods who have succumbed to the Z-virus; these creatures retain all their memories and powers, but have lost all moral guardrails. Thankfully for the survivors, these creatures are very territorial and rarely venture out….. rarely.

### Designing Traits 

**Converting Powers into Traits**

When designing threats, you’re encouraged to take inspiration from powers in the game and convert them into simple, narrative-friendly Traits. Traits don’t need full mechanical write-ups; they’re shorthand abilities. If you want a threat to have the leaping power, you give them a Leaping Pace. Do you want a threat to have Energy Blast: Electrical? give them an Electric Energy Blast: Electrical as an attack. Regeneration? Give your threat a trait where it regenerates 5 stamina at the end of every turn.

However, whenever you base a Trait on a power, note the power it’s inspired by and assign it a default Rank, typically equal to the threat’s Rank. (for Mimic and power checks).

You can adjust the default Rank up or down if the ability is unusually strong or weak for the threat. Keeping the Rank consistent ensures that abilities feel balanced and that heroes interacting with those powers (via Mimic, Counter, etc.) have a clear mechanical anchor.

Traits remain narrative-first; they’re there to create memorable moments without bogging down the game, but this small bookkeeping step keeps them fully integrated into the system when needed.

**Creating Non-Power Traits & Ability Scores**

Not all Traits need to be derived from powers; threats can have Traits inspired by animals, human training, or environmental advantages. Examples: Pack Tactics (gains Advantage if adjacent to ally), Keen Senses (Advantage wisdom-based Challenges to Observe), or Adrenaline Surge (acts at initiative count 20 once per scene). You can also adapt player Maneuvers and Feats into Traits. Note: threats do not themselves take feats; instead, they express these as part of their Traits.

**Save DCs**

Some Traits require heroes to make saving throws. To calculate a Trait’s Save DC, use:

*8 + Threat’s Rank Bonus + relevant ability modifier = DC*

For example, a Strength-based grapple from an Epsilon threat (STR 20 (+5) + Rank Bonus +2), would set a DC of 15.

As a quick shortcut, you can also refer to the following table of typical Trait DCs by Rank:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 28%" />
<col style="width: 71%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th colspan="2"><strong>Table X-X Trait Save DCs</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Rank</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Typical Trait Save DC</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zeta</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Epsilon</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delta</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gamma</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beta</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">17</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alpha</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">18</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Theta+</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">19–20</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You are encouraged to adjust DCs slightly if a Trait is unusually potent or weak for its Rank, trust your judgment.

**Recharge**

Some Traits represent powerful abilities that can shift the entire flow of a battle, area attacks, or debilitating conditions like *Stunned* or *Frightened*. To keep these traits from becoming too overwhelming, assign them a Recharge mechanic rather than allowing them every turn.

When should you apply a Recharge value to a trait? Basically, any trait that targets multiple heroes (Area of Effect), imposes strong conditions (Stun, Prone, Restrained, Fear), or bypasses normal defenses or forces multiple saves.

Recharge checks are triggered at the start of every turn or when the target suffers a wound; roll a single 1d6 and compare the result to all traits which have been used and are waiting to be *recharged*.

- Strong single-target conditions (like Stun) should have a Recharge of 5-6

- Area of Effect damage or moderate debuffs: Recharge 4-6

- Massive tide-turning effects: Recharge 6

**Iconic Traits**  
Some traits are so devastating, so cinematic, that they should be limited to **once per scene**. These are the kind of moments that would deserve a *two-page splash panel* in a comic; they should feel iconic and dramatic.

\<sidebar\>  
### Standard Trait Format

**Trait Name**  
*Flavor line / narrative hook*  
Action Type Required (if any)

Effect: Mechanical effect in plain language, target(s), and resolution.

Attack traits include:

- Attack bonus

- Defense targeted (Avoidance, Fortitude, or Discipline)

- Range or area of effect and number of targets

- Damage (dice + static), Damage type (Ballistic, Slashing, Sonic, etc.)

- Any ongoing or triggered conditions with Save DC

- Any recharge mechanic, if applicable, or how many uses per scene.

Other traits should follow:

- Range or area of effect with the number of targets

- Any ongoing or triggered conditions with save DC

- Any recharge mechanic, if applicable, or how many uses per scene.

#### Attack Trait Examples

Below are two attack trait examples: Seismic Slam is an expression of *Enhanced Ability Score (Strength),* Sonic Wave is an expression of *Energy Attack (Sonic),* and Psychic Crush is envisioned as a power stunt for *Psychic Attack.*

**Seismic Slam**  
*“The ground shook under his fists, and we all went flying.”*

Action  
**Effect:** This creature slams the ground, affecting its area and all adjacent areas. Each enemy in the affected Areas must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Half damage on a success. Recharge: 5–6.  
  
**Sonic Wave**  
*“A focused beam of pure sound slammed into me like a truck.”*

Action  
**Effect:** +9 vs Avoidance, 10 area range, 1 target, deals 4d6+2 Sonic damage.

**Psychic Crush**  
*“It felt like my skull was going to split open.”*

Action  
**Effect:** As an Action, the creature targets one hero within 2 Areas. The hero must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn. Recharge: 5–6.

#### Narrative Trait Examples

These are some traits that represent creature behavior or unique abilities. Use these to create a narrative for your threat and reinforce its behavior through the mechanics. *Unshaken Resolve* and *The Mask Never Cracks* below could be a good expression of the *Invulnerability* power.

**Horde Mentality**  
*“There were so many of them, so many.”*  
**Effect:** Gains +1 Attack bonus for each allied zombie in the same Area, up to +3.

**Minions are expendable**  
*“I don’t understand how they follow that madman.”*  
Reaction

**Effect:** When this threat is targeted by an attack they are aware of, they may redirect the attack to an allied creature of lower Rank within the same area. The ally takes the full effect of the attack instead.

**Not Without My Horde**

*"Their devotion gives him strength, even as it drains theirs*."  
**Effect:** This threat gains Advantage on all attacks and saving throws while at least one allied minion is present in the same Area. If no allies remain, the threat suffers Disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of the scene.

**Unshaken Resolve**

*"You could see it in his eyes - nothing we did was going to stop him."*  
**Effect:** The first time this threat would be Stunned, Prone, or otherwise lose its next turn, it ignores the effect entirely. This can occur once per scene.

**The Mask Never Cracks**

*"Even as we tore him apart, he never let us see the pain."*  
**Effect:** The threat never visibly shows harm or distress, regardless of the number of wounds it has suffered. This threat is immune to the *Wounded* condition. Additionally, when below half Wounds, the threat gains Advantage on challenges to intimidate or otherwise unnerve oppoents.

### Default power score guidelines 

When designing powered threats in *Rotted Capes,* you don’t necessarily use the powers, but use them more as a guideline when creating traits as mentioned above, but to properly interact with some powers, you should list the powers and their power scores on your threat’s statblock.  
  
Not only does this provide you with everything you need to roll power checks and have the necessary information for players with powers such as nullify and mimic. However, it provides you with additional tools when running encounters. You should lean into a threat's traits, but sometimes a threat may want to try something a little out of the box with their powers.

Here is a quick guideline when assigning power scores:

- One primary power can approach the Rank Cap.

- Each additional power is typically 3 to 5 points lower than the previous one.

The more powers a threat has, the less individually potent each power becomes.  
  
Remember, threats can also possess power stunts; they may emulate powers or power tricks, both of which should be represented as traits. Just keep in mind that emulated powers have a power score of -6, that of their parents' score, which should be represented in the trait’s capabilities (dealing damage as a power one rank lower, for example).

#### Advanced Threat Design: Point Pools & Granular Control

If you prefer more granular control, you can build advanced threats using a *Power Point Pool by Rank.*

Just assign the threat a pool of points equal to: Rank Cap × Number of Powers ÷ 1.5 (rounded down).

Distribute these points among their powers as you see fit, respecting individual power caps, of course.

For example:

Delta Rank (Rank Cap 30),

2 Powers: 30 × 2 ÷ 1.5 = 40 points total.

Allocate: Power 1 = 26, Power 2 = 14.

Or, for 4 powers:

Delta Rank (Rank Cap 30),

4 Powers: 30 × 4 ÷ 1.5 = 80 points.

Allocate: 20 / 18 / 16 / 16.

This approach offers full flexibility and helps balance unusual or highly customized threats.

####  Zombie Traits 

**Attrition:** Zombies must feed to stay active. If they have not fed in a few months, they will slip into a semi-active state, remaining still like corpses for weeks on end. During this time, zombies decompose at a much slower rate and will "wake up" when they hear any loud noise within 10 areas or smell a living creature within 3 Areas.

**Enhanced Zombie Senses:** +5 bonus to all challenges when attempting to perceive living creatures through sight, smell, or sound. Additionally, they can see in natural darkness.

**The Speed of the Dammed: A** Zombie that has fed on fresh meat over the last week has its walking pace increased by 3

**Relentless Nature:** Zombies attack the living with little regard for their safety. If they do not use actions to end the *engulfed* condition.

####  Common Traits 

These are a collection of common threat traits

**Ambusher**

*I swear to you, it came out of nowhere, that… thing. Cut down Steve before he knew what hit him, honesty a better way to go truth be told.*

**Effect:** In the first round of a combat, a creature with this feature has Advantage on attack rolls against any creature it surprised

**Aggressive**

*I'm telling you, it just tossed a car to the side as it came at us; I had no idea something that big could move that fast,*

**Effect:** As a bonus action once per scene, a creature with this trait can move an additional 2 areas as long as it is moving toward a hostile creature. If the creature has a high strength score to move an object in its path, it may do so as part of its movement.

**Cannibalistic Zombie**

*Dude, I know what I saw! I saw that 10-foot THING grab a zombie and take its head right off with a single bite! It was eating Z's man, Z's! Umm… ok… I think I'm going to throw up again.*

**Requirement:** Zombie or Abomination

**Effect:** Some very rare zombies have been seen eating other zombies. This could be due to a lack of food or a mutation of the Z-virus; regardless, zombies with this Advantage can trigger both *Speed of the Dammed* by eating other zombies. Some abominations have also been seen eating zombies, in which case they gain 20 temporary stamina for 1 hour after eating a zombie.

**Claws of the Dammed**

*They took him down! They pulled Titan to the ground, I tell you! I saw it with my own eyes.*

**Requirement:** Zombie

**Effect:** Anytime a zombie succeeds in a Grab attempt, it also deals its melee attack damage, which can result in infection.

**Cunning Zombie**

*The look in its eyes, I'm telling you, that Zombie in the blue shirt was not like the rest of them. It always stayed behind the others, almost using them as cover! I was lucky to escape alive.*

**Requirement:** Zombie

**Effect:** Unlike other zombies, Cunning Zombies do not have their mental abilities reduced. Also, unlike other zombies, it will seek to preserve itself and even overcome the automatic feeding desire that comes with the Consumption of the Flesh. They will take the time to put out fires and attempt to escape to preserve their undead existence. Set the Zombie’s intelligence, wisdom, and charisma to 10.

**Enhanced Strength  **
*“If you throw another semi-truck at me, I’m going to lose it” – Arch Lighting.* **  
Requirement:** 20+ Str  
**Effect:** Ceature’s strength score is doubled to determine how much they can lift, carry, or drag. The creature also has Advantage on strength checks and strength saving throws.

**Grappler**

*They literally pulled Titan Down; I'm telling you, they literally pulled him down.*

**Effect:** Upon a successful melee attack, the creature with this trait may attempt the grab combat maneuver as a bonus action. Once they have a creature grappled, they gain a +2 bonus on all grappling combat maneuvers.

**Home Field Advantage**

*Always choose where the battle takes place; when you don't, you become the prey, not the hunter.*

**Effect:** When a creature with this trait fights in its lair or territory (a city block or so), it gains a +1 bonus to all its defenses and a +1 bonus to hit.

**  
Innocent Appearance**

*I saw that Zombie again, the one in the blue shirt. It waved to me, almost like it was calling me over! We need to take that thing out; if I didn't know better, I could have sworn it was a breather.*

**Requirement:** Cunning Zombie

**Effect:** By using a combination of shadows and a slightly more "life-like" skin, the zombie appears human from even a close distance. Oppoents suffer Disadvantage on all Wisdom and Intelligence challenges to recognize the zombie's true nature.

Commonly referred to as "*Damsels*," these zombies sometimes mimic frightened Bystanders in the hope of drawing a Survivor close. Unlike other zombie types, damsels don't travel in groups, preferring to surround themselves with other zombie types, which they will use to their Advantage.

**Mimicry**

*It was calling out for help, but there was just something about that voice that threw me off. Thank God, I know how many others feel for it.*

**Effect:** Creatures with this trait can mimic simple sounds they have heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. Oppoents must succeed in DC: 15 (Wisdom or Intelligence) challenge to recognize the sound is just “off”.

**Virulent Infection**

*I'm telling you he turned within an hour, not days. hours… I saw it happen!!!*

**Requirement:** Zombie

**Effect:** Zombies with this trait have a super changed version of the Z virus (see pg XX), increasing the attack bonus to +12, Resistance DC to 30, and the infection track gets spent up to 30min, 1hr, 2hr, and 3hr respectively.

**Wolf Pack Tactics**

*The way Z's bring down pray reminds me of a pack of wolves, but not as… strategic. Maybe more like ants swarming a body? I don't know, but it's creepy as hell.*

**Effect:** Creatures with this trait gain Advantage on an attack roll against a target if at least one of the creatures' allies is in the same area as the target and the ally isn't incapacitated.
