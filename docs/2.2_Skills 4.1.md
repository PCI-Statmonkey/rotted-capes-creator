*Good morning. My name is Kath O'Malley. I've been asked to pass on a few little nuggets of information. With my powers, they should sink in. Just kidding! I wouldn't do that to you.*

*First, treat this world like it's Noah's Ark. Always travel in pairs. It doesn't matter what you have to do, always have someone keep an eye on you. If you need to pee or take a dump, the time for being shy is over. The last thing you want is some zombie attacking you with your literal pants down.*

*Second, remember, fire is your best friend in this apocalypse. It's the only treatment for zombie bites. Always have a way to make fire-hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, matches, a lighter, and some type of cloth. Then, be prepared to treat the burn. Keep a close watch on the bite victim. If you see signs of infection, you may have to make a tough call. But remember, you're in control. Act quickly and quietly. And if the worst happens and the victim turns into a super zombie, remember, you have the power to end it. *

*Third, zombies, for the most part, are stupid. They don't use tools. They can't open doors or windows. They can't get out of seat belts. They can't climb ladders. They tend to be slow and clumsy. All they want to do is feed. Single zombies are generally no threat. They should be taken out quietly. If you go in guns blazing, the sound will draw every zombie for miles. Zombies are attracted by sound and movement. If they see you move, they will follow you. Sound can be your friend. Car alarms, car radios, boom boxes, and anything that makes noise will attract zombies. Just make sure you aren't seen while setting off your noisemakers.*

*Then there are the super zombies. These zombies are apex predator-eating machines. They have no morality, and their intellects are intact. You want to avoid them at all costs. There is a rumor that super zombies can acquire more powers by eating other supers. If I am bitten and in danger of turning, please blow my head off. My powers are emotion control, mind control, and telepathy.  If I become a super zombie, I can easily fool the guards, walk right into camp, and discreetly start feeding on who I want to. *

*Fourth, dogs. Dogs are no longer man's best friend. They are territorial, travel in packs, and most haven't had their rabies shots. There is no cure for rabies, just a long, painful death.*

*Fifth, other survivors. You never know what to expect from other survivors. Mel Brooks wrote a song, "Hope for the Best. Expect the Worst". Other survivors are just as scared of you as you are of them. Some may offer trade. Some may be just barely getting by. Some may just be ready to shoot you and loot your corpse. Just be cautious. *

*You can almost always tell a building that has people. The windows will be boarded up on the first floor. The smallest window will have a big pile of garbage outside of it. People don't want to live in their own filth. Bodies may have been burned or possibly buried. If there are bodies in the street, check the position the body is in. You may figure out where other survivors are sniping from.*

*On scavenging. Don't kick in every door. Learn to pick locks. Also, make a little noise before going in. You may hear zombies stumbling around the place, even the clack, clack, clack of gnashing teeth. If a building has large glass doors or windows, and you must break them to get in, try to break the lower portions and crawl in. Zombies are too stupid to crawl in after you. *

*Always look for traps. Super zombies still have their intellects. Snares and tripwire may hurt or cripple you, but you're still fresh meat. Also, survivors will protect a stash. Some "Last Man on Earth" may have a whole series of booby traps protecting his place. *

*Always shop with a list. Just get the stuff you need and get home safely. Are there things you should always look out for? Absolutely. Multivitamins. Unless you live on a farm, your diet is canned crap. First aid supplies. Fire extinguishers. There is no 911 service. Ammunition. If you need personal items, bring someone with you. Don't be embarrassed if you need underwear or tampons.*

*Thanks for listening. Please come back alive and in one piece. *

In this chapter, we break down **Skill Sets** and how to use them to tell your stories.

Rather than selecting individual skills, *Rotted Capes* uses Skill Sets; punchy, thematic descriptions that reflect your hero’s background, training, and survivor experience. Instead of being trained in something narrow like "Engineering" or "Stealth," your hero might be a *former law enforcement officer* and an *amateur athlete*, or a *retired intelligence operative* with an *obsession for old sci-fi movies.*

Don’t underestimate what you can learn from movies…  
*“I have an idea. Hey, do you remember that old movie... Aliens?”*

What we give you here is nowhere near a complete list of possible Skill Sets. Instead, look at this as a launch pad with a few dozen examples to ignite ideas. Take one as-is, tweak it to fit your hero, or invent something brand new. The rules aren’t here to constrain your creativity; they're here to unlock it.

The following rules are basic guidelines, a flexible framework that gives both you and the Editor-in-Chief what you need to keep things moving, tell cinematic stories, and hopefully keep you from becoming Super-Z’s chow.

# Using Ability Scores and Skill Sets

Throughout the game, there will be moments when your hero’s abilities will be tested. Maybe you're negotiating with the leader of a desperate enclave, rewiring a busted drone, sneaking past an occupied Super-Z, or sprinting across a collapsing rooftop, these events are referred to as Challenges.  
  
Challenges are not issued for common skill use, but reserved for when failure has a tangible effect, and success moves the story forward.

When issued a Challenge, you will either make an **ability check** or, if applicable, a **skill check** to meet the Challenge. Ability checks represent raw, innate talent. While skills are a demonstration of your experience, training, or learned instinct.

When you are asked to make a check to meet a challenge, it’s up to you to describe to the Editor-in-Chief how one of your skill sets might apply and which ability score you wish to use on your skill check. If the Editor-in-Chief agrees, you roll your skill check; if you can’t apply any of your skill sets to the check, you instead roll a standard ability check.

Ability Checks are a d20 roll + your ability score modifier. If you can apply a skill set to meet the challenge, you also get to add your rank bonus to the roll.

## Editor-in-Chief's Guide to Ability Scores use

When a Challenge arises, and a player proposes a Skill Set + Ability Score combo, your job as Editor-in-Chief is to determine whether it makes sense in context. Here’s a quick cheat sheet to help you decide which ability best fits the action at hand.

| **Ability** | **Typical Use Cases** |
|----|----|
| **Strength** | Physical force, lifting, breaking, melee power, brute intimidation. |
| **Dexterity** | Stealth, agility, balance, aiming, reflex-based reaction time. |
| **Constitution** | Endurance, resisting fatigue, holding breath, withstanding pain or toxins. |
| **Intelligence** | Academic knowledge, deductive reasoning, analysis, tech use, tactical planning. |
| **Wisdom** | Perception, gut instinct, emotional read, survival sense, spiritual insight. |
| **Charisma** | Persuasion, leadership, deception, confidence, rallying others under pressure. |

Editors don’t forget to let players pitch creative combinations, like Wisdom for calming a crowd, or Intelligence for predicting an ambush. If it fits the fiction, run with it.  
  
\</side bar\>

## Edges 

Skill Sets can have any number of Edges, which are statements that describe a particular aspect of your skill set that you are exceptionally good at. Edges should be descriptive and thought-provoking but not overly broad. Any time you meet a challenge for which you can apply an edge you add double your rank bonus to your skill check.

For example, for Combat Medic, you might have “I can stabilize anyone, anywhere,” or “I did some work for the CDC.”

### Deep Cut Moments 

Not all Skill Sets see equal screen time. Some are highly situational or tied to specific character backstories that only occasionally take center stage. When an obscure Skill Set becomes suddenly vital, or when a challenge hits close to your hero’s personal history, it triggers a *Deep Cut Moment**.***

When you have a *deep cut moment,* you gain an Advantage to meet the challenge**;** in addition, you earn **1 Plot Point** for leaning into your character’s unique flavor.

Deep Cut Moments are a tool for spotlighting niche Skill Sets and character arcs. Don’t force them, they’re special because they’re rare. When one naturally emerges in the fiction, reward it.

## Difficulty Class 

Any time there is a challenge, it's the Editor-In-Chief who sets your target number or Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check succeeds. Otherwise, it’s a failure, and what that failure entails is up to the Editor-In-Chief.

## Examples of Skill Sets in Play 

## Example 1: "It’s Not My First Riot"

Apparitions’ team is trying to calm down a panicked group of survivors who’ve just escaped a Z’d ambush. One man is screaming at the group’s leader, threatening to leave. The Editor-in-Chief calls for a Challenge; if someone doesn’t intervene, the group will fracture and take essential supplies with them.

Apparitions’ player says:

*“I want to step in and de-escalate, I’ve got the ‘Ex-Law Enforcement’ Skill Set, and my Focus is ‘I’ve talked down worse.’ I’m using **Charisma** to project calm authority and take control of the situation.”*

The Editor-in-Chief agrees that it fits the Skill Set and Focus. The Challenge DC is set at 15.

Apparitions’ player rolls:

d20 + double their Rank Bonus + Charisma Modifier

She rolls a total of 19 and succeeds.

With that, the Editor-in-Chief exclaims *“With the crowd calmed and order restored, the group agrees to stay,”* buying the heroes time and gaining a valuable ally.

### Example 2: “Built This in My Garage”

Zero is trying to reactivate a rusted-out security drone buried in the wreckage of a mall. The Editor-in-Chief calls for a Challenge; if successful, the team gains a mobile scout. If not, the failure might trigger a sensor ping or damage the drone beyond use.

Zero’s player says:  
*“I’m using my ‘Garage Engineer’ Skill Set. I literally rebuilt a salvaged servo-leg with a spatula and a soldering iron once. I want to roll with **Intelligence**.*

The Editor-in-Chief approves. The drone is fragile and long dormant, so the DC is set at 20.

Zero rolls:

d20 + their Rank Bonus + Intelligence Modifier

*She rolls a total of 12 and fails the check.*

The Editor-in-Chief rules that the drone sparks, briefly hums to life, and then shorts out completely. Worse, the noise echoes across the loading bay, something hears it.

## Face-Offs

Most Challenges pit a hero against the world, a crumbling rooftop, a rusted generator, a ticking bomb. But sometimes? It’s personal. A stare-down across a rooftop. A clash of ideals in front of a crowd. A digital duel in the guts of a dying server. That’s when you enter a Face-Off.

In a Face-Off, two characters roll to meet the same Challenge from opposite sides. Each side uses the relevant Ability Score and applies bonuses from any applicable Skill Sets, Edges, or powers.

Whoever rolls higher wins the moment. With ties going to the initiator of the face-off,

If both sides are reacting (e.g., two defenders), the outcome is a stalemate, and neither side gains ground.

Face-Offs are best reserved for moments of narrative tension, not for every debate or stealth roll. Use them when both sides matter, and when the outcome shifts the story.  
**  
Examples of Face-Offs:**

***Shadows and Searchlights***

*A hero creeps across the rooftop (Dexterity + Urban Explorer) while a bystander scans the dark (Wisdom + Enclave Watchman).*

***Digital Duel***

*A techno-hero tries to breach an ancient AI firewall (Intelligence + Visionary) while the AI digs in (Intelligence + Machine Security Protocol).*

***Words Like Weapons***

*A cult leader (Charisma + Cult Savior) rallies the frightened crowd. The hero steps forward (Charisma + Community Organizer), trying to break his hold over his followers.*

## Restricted Challenges

Not every Challenge can be met by just anyone. While most obstacles can be approached with creative justification, some tasks demand experience, full stop.

As Editor-in-Chief, you have the authority to decide when a Challenge is restricted, meaning it can only be attempted by a hero with a relevant Skill Set.

For general tasks, such as climbing a wall, calming a frightened civilian, or scavenging supplies, anyone can make an Ability Check. Skill Sets give an edge, context, or bonus, but they’re not mandatory. If a player can sell you on how their ability applies, let them try.

But certain actions cross a line into expertise. You don’t land a plane by guessing. You don’t perform surgery just because you’re smart. For these, the Challenge is restricted unless the character has an applicable Skill Set.

Examples might include:

- Flying an aircraft (e.g., needs Pilot Training or Air Force Experience)

- Performing battlefield surgery (Combat Medic, Trauma Nurse)

- Bypassing high-level security (Tactical Infiltration, Black Hat)

- Reprogramming alien tech (Visionary, First Contact Specialist)

- Performing ancient rituals or banishments (Mystic Acolyte, Occult Scholar)

If no one at the table has the Skill Set? That’s the point. Not every door opens. Not every problem has a brute force solution. This is not punishing players, you’re preserving the spotlight. Letting anyone fly a jet makes the *Ex-Air Force Ace* feel pointless. Sometimes the best answer is: “You can’t do that… but maybe someone else in your enclave can.”

###  Circumstances 

Sometimes the situation itself tips the odds, either in your favor or against you.

The Editor-in-Chief may grant you Advantage or Disadvantage on a check depending on the circumstances surrounding the Challenge.

> *For example:*  
> Sneaking down a hallway covered in soft carpet? You might get Advantage.
>
> That same carpet, now soaked and squishy with water? You’re probably rolling with Disadvantage.

When the environment, gear, weather, or even narrative timing makes a difference, the Editor-in-Chief has the freedom to tilt the odds accordingly.

See Advantage/Disadvantage, pg. XX, for more details.

## The Right Tools for the Job 

Having the right tools can mean the difference between rousing success or a catastrophic mess.

When attempting a Skill Set check that clearly requires specific tools, such as performing field surgery, repairing a drone, or picking a high-security lock, attempting it without the proper gear imposes a -5 penalty to your roll.

If you have something that could work, improvised tools, jury-rigged gear, or a creative workaround, the Editor-in-Chief may allow the check, but with a reduced penalty of -3 instead.

In some cases, though, the Editor-in-Chief might rule that the challenge is flat-out impossible without tools, especially if it's something highly technical, delicate, or dangerous.

## Failing Forward 

Just because you didn’t meet the Challenge doesn’t mean you *failed*, at least, not in the traditional sense.

Sometimes you still succeed, just not cleanly. The Editor-in-Chief may let the action succeed, but with a twist, setback, or complication. Maybe you get what you wanted, but not how you wanted it, or not without drawing attention, burning a resource, or making things worse elsewhere.

If you, the player, suggest your *own* complication, something dramatic, dangerous, or just plain cool, you might earn a **Plot Point** for leaning into it, especially if it adds something juicy to the scene.

Don’t treat this like punishment; it’s an opportunity.

You’re not just failing… you’re **making the story better**.

If your idea makes the Editor-in-Chief grin, wince, or scribble in their notes, there’s a Plot Point with your name on it.

So, when things go sideways? Lean in. Make it count. Make it *memorable*.

## Skills in a Fight 

Commonly, most of the time, meeting a Challenge in combat could be part of your normal action, such as jumping to an adjacent rooftop, noticing the fact that the ceiling might be about to come down, or noticing a super zombie hiding in the shadows about to pounce. However, sometimes a Challenge may take you longer to complete, requiring more time and attention.  
  
Your Editor-in-Chief assigns what kind of action the challenge might entail, anything from a bonus action to a demanding action.

Once the action type is settled upon, with the Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may then choose to meet the challenge normally, perform a *Rush Job,* or choose to *Take Your Time.*

***Rush Jobs:*** You can **reduce the time** the action takes by one step (e.g., from an Action to a Bonus Action), but you roll with **Disadvantage**.  
  
***Take Your Time:*** You can **take longer** than usual, step the action *up* by one level (e.g., a Bonus Action becomes a full Action). When you do, you roll with **Advantage**.  
  
**Social Encounters**

Not every obstacle can be punched through; sometimes, survival depends on saying the right thing at the right time.

In social encounters, your hero’s background, instincts, and experience matter just as much as their words. Maybe you were a grifter, a beat cop, a preacher, or a washed-up news anchor, whatever your story, your Skill Sets can shape how you deal with people.

Before any dice are rolled, the Editor-in-Chief will ask what you're saying and what you're trying to accomplish. If you make a strong case in-character, that may be enough, no roll required. Good roleplaying with clear intent can open doors without ever touching the dice.

But when the stakes are high, or the outcome uncertain, the Editor-in-Chief may call for a Challenge, and it’s up to you to:

- Describe **how** one of your Skill Sets applies to the situation.

- Propose an **Ability Score** that reflects how you're approaching the moment (Charisma to inspire, Intelligence to outmaneuver, Wisdom to read someone, etc.)

Modifiers may also apply depending on the circumstances—having a weapon drawn, recent shared trauma, bribes, glowing super-hands, or just plain desperation.

Example,

*“I’m a former Cult Survivor. I know the fear in his eyes because I used to have it. I’m not trying to intimidate him, I want to use **Wisdom**, not my Charisma. I want him to know I understand what he’s feeling and that he’s not alone.”*

This system is intended to draw upon the character’s story and context. The more believable and logical your approach is, the better chance you'll have of swaying hearts, minds... or at least not getting shot.

## Sample Skill Sets: From Grounded to Cinematic

The world’s ended, but your story hasn’t, and how you survived (or thrived) matters.

What follows are over 40 Skill Sets to choose from: first, we have a list of more grounded skill sets followed by more cinematic options to match your style of play, a good skill sets pulls double duty, they give you skills you can use while they shape your hero’s backstory, giving them a little more depth.

Some skill sets are gritty and deadpan, like former law enforcement, ex-gang muscle, combat medic. Then, later, we give you stylized nods to the kind of hero (or anti-hero) you might have been if the world hadn’t gone to hell: the billionaire playboy, the long-lived wanderer, the mask that outlived its legacy.

Each Skill Set comes with a short write-up to guide how it might be used in play, and you might notice some cross over here and there, this is normal, people from completely different walks of live can commonly come at a problem from two different directions. Use these skill sets as-is, tweak them to fit, or create your own. Crafting a good skill set is simple: reflect on who your hero was before everything changed, and how that past still matters when the Z’d are clawing through the door.

### Grounded Skill Set

**Beat Cop**  
You weren’t a superhero, but you wore a badge and tried to make a difference. You know how to read a crowd, take down a threat without killing them, and recognize when someone’s about to crack. The law’s dead, but your instincts aren’t.

**Confidence Artist**  
You don't lie. You tell better stories than the truth. You have a face people trust, a voice they lean into, and a bag full of tricks to keep them leaning until you've got what you want. In the new world, that makes you dangerous, and very, very valuable.

**Corporate Power Broker**  
You’ve sat at the head of the table and closed deals that moved billions. You understand how systems work, how to leverage influence, bury scandals, or launch initiatives with a signature. You shine in negotiation, corporate manipulation, and turning resources into results.

**Cybercriminal**  
You weren’t hacking for justice; you did it for profit, sabotage, or fun. But now your fingers still know how to crack firewalls, spoof signals, and manipulate old-world systems. This Skill Set thrives in digital ruins and compromised networks.

**Diplomatic Protocol**  
You’ve been trained in political etiquette, negotiation under tension, and how to read the cues of diplomatic posturing. You know how to avoid war with a word, and when to let silence speak. Use this to navigate power structures, negotiate tense standoffs, and defuse a crisis.

**Disaster Responder**  
You were there when the levees broke, the fires raged, or the buildings came down. Before Z-Day, you already knew how to work in chaos. You move fast, think faster, and carry people who can’t move at all. You were a frontline responder before it was cool. Or mandatory.

**Entrepreneur**  
You used to live in a world of pitches, pivots, and backchannel deals. Negotiating is second nature, and reading people is your bread and butter. The game’s changed now, but you still know how to hustle, schmooze, and get what your team needs with a smile and a handshake. Especially if it’s not totally legal.

**Ex-Military Operative**  
You’ve served special ops, black-ops, or just a hardened grunt. You know how to clear rooms, plan ambushes, and survive when everything goes to hell. Use this set for tactics, weapon proficiency, or intimidating green survivors into shape.

**Field Engineer**  
You can build, repair, and improvise under pressure. Whether fixing a collapsed tunnel or building a one-use gadget from spare parts, you make things work when they shouldn’t. You shine in battlefield repair, scavenged tech builds, and makeshift defenses.

**Former Publicist**  
Once you managed celebrity crises, now you manage scared survivors and nervous enclave leaders. You shine when smoothing tensions, shaping narratives, and getting people to follow your lead, even if they don’t want to.

**Forensic Analyst**  
Long before Z-Day, you studied patterns, blood spatter, broken routines, missing people. Now you’re still looking at evidence, only its rot patterns, claw marks, or the subtle signs of a staged scene. You're methodical, observant, and absolutely not fooled by a tidy surface.

**Media Manipulation**  
You understand public perception, spin, and the power of image. Maybe you worked in PR, journalism, or politics, but now you use that savvy to control a room, rally a crowd, or put just the right fear into someone’s heart. Useful for influence, reputation, and strategic messaging.

**Occult Hobbyist**  
You weren’t born to the mystic life, but you’ve dabbled. You’ve been to the wrong forums, read the forbidden texts, and survived a few strange nights. You're not sure if it’s real, but the stuff you’ve seen? The chants that work? You don’t talk about it unless you trust someone. And you rarely trust anyone.

**Occult Scholar**  
You’ve seen the patterns in ancient books or whispered across the dark web. You know the symbols that make blood run cold and how to pronounce names that shouldn't be spoken. Others think it's nonsense, until the symbols start glowing and the dead move with purpose.

**Olympic Hopeful**  
Before the world fell apart, you trained to be the best. Your life revolved around peak physical conditioning and competitive discipline. Now those same reflexes, bursts of strength, and team instincts are survival tools. You can vault a rooftop gap or recognize someone’s breathing pattern in a crowd—because you’ve pushed your body beyond average.

**Outdoor Survivalist**  
Pre-Z-Day you were a park ranger, prepper, or survivalist nut. Now? You’re the reason the group is still breathing. This skill set helps with wilderness survival, scavenging, animal threats, and guiding groups through the wilds.

**Private Investigator**  
You made your living in the shadows of the city, trailing cheaters, digging through lies, and asking the questions no one wanted answered. You’re skilled at reading people, noticing what’s off, and piecing together a puzzle from scraps and contradictions. You shine in investigations, tailing suspects, and uncovering hard truths, especially the ones nobody asked for.

**Professional Thief**  
You didn’t just steal to survive, you stole for the thrill, the money, or because you were damn good at it. You know how to get in, get out, and leave no trace. Great for infiltration, causing enclaves, or bypassing security, old or new.

**Saboteur**  
You're not here to win fair. You're here to make sure the other guy loses hard. You know where to plant the charge, when to cut the brake line, and how to vanish into the dust. Chaos is your signature, and you rarely need to pull the trigger twice.

**Science YouTuber**  
Before the fall, you were just another face on a screen explaining particle physics with puppets and pop culture. Now, you're still breaking down complicated concepts, only it's to help your team understand how to weaponize fertilizer or rig solar panels. You make science feel like magic again.

**Scientific Fieldwork**  
You weren’t stuck in a lab, you were out there gathering samples, running diagnostics, and solving real-world problems with limited gear. You shine in improvised analysis, problem-solving under pressure, and applying scientific principles outside sterile environments.

**Strategic Command Training**  
You’ve been trained in battlefield tactics, threat assessment, and team coordination, whether in the military, paramilitary, or as part of a crisis response unit, or maybe even a superhero team. You’re rarely surprised and always thinking three moves ahead. You shine when organizing groups, calling plays, or seeing angles others miss.

**Street Magician**  
You’ve got fast hands and a smooth tongue. Whether it’s palming a coin or distracting someone with a well-timed card trick, you live by sleight of hand and misdirection. Great for infiltration, charm, or escaping sticky situations.

**Street Mechanic**  
No certifications. No paperwork. Just hands-on, knuckle-busted experience. Whether under the hood or cobbling together gear from scrap, you know how machines think. You learned it in back alleys, salvage yards, and stolen moments with working tech. You make things run, sometimes better than they were built.

**Street Performer**  
You lived for the crowd. Sleight of hand, spoken word, or a guitar solo at dusk, you knew how to make people feel something. Now, you do the same to distract zombies, rally survivors, or disguise sleight of hand with flair. In a dead world, you're still making moments come alive.

**Tactical Infiltration**  
You specialize in getting in where others can’t. Locks, vents, sensors, and even zombie patrols, you know how to bypass or disable them. Whether in black ops or high-end theft, you’ve earned your skill the hard way.

**Undercover Operative**  
You've been trained to become someone else, how to blend, how to lie without blinking, how to wear the right mask for the job. You’re skilled in infiltration, social manipulation, and operating without backup.

**Underworld Courier**  
When someone needed something moved and couldn't trust the postal service or police, they called you. Now you still carry packages, data drives, medicines, or desperate notes, and you still get them through. You don’t ask what’s in the bag. You just get it there. Alive, if possible.

**Urban Explorer**  
You knew how to navigate the city before the fall, now those skills are vital. Whether parkouring rooftops, avoiding Z swarms via storm drains, or scrounging in forgotten bunkers, this set helps you survive the concrete jungle.

**Urban Recon Training**  
You’ve studied how to navigate, observe, and act within a city environment, on foot, across rooftops, through sewers, or behind a scope. Whether you were military, law enforcement, or just a skilled freelancer, you’re the eyes and ears in hostile territory.

**Visionary**  
Where others see scrap, you see potential. Where others see the laws of physics, you see design challenges. Maybe you’ve built tech no one else could even sketch, battle suits, AI systems, adaptive weapons, contingency networks. Your genius isn’t just raw intelligence; it’s the ability to see ten steps ahead and build the tools you’ll need before the problem exists. You shine when pushing the boundaries of engineering, repurposing impossible tech, or building miracles under pressure.

### Cinematic Skill Sets

**Alien Scout**

You’ve got alien tech, training in advanced systems, and maybe a different understanding of physics altogether. This is great for intuitive tech roles, deciphering Earth customs, or finding unexpected solutions via off-world knowledge.

**Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist**  
You were never the strongest, but you were always the smartest, the richest, or the most charming person in the room, and you weaponized that. You excel at resource coordination, high-society manipulation, press-facing spin, and turning favors into victories. Even now, the game is just played with fewer rules and sharper stakes.

**Black Market Fixer**  
If someone wanted it pre-Z, you could get it. Now, you still can. You know what things are worth, how to negotiate, and who trades what. This set excels in scavenging, bartering, and recognizing what’s truly valuable.

**Born to Wear the Mask**  
You grew up in legacy, tradition, and expectations. The costume wasn’t a calling; it was an inheritance. You were trained to inspire, to lead, and to represent something larger than yourself. You shine in public settings, with formal command, and when carrying the weight of a symbol.

**Comic Book Archivist**

Pre-Z-Day, you were a mega-fan, deep in lore. And now? Well, it turns out comics got a lot right. You shine when referencing tropes, recognizing power types, or giving surprisingly good tactical advice based on superhero logic.

**Conspiracy Theorist**

Sure, everyone laughed when you said the government was hiding zombies under Area 51, until Z-Day hit. Now your “crazy” theories might just be right. You shine in connecting bizarre dots, spouting fringe science, and improvising with weird, scavenged gear.

**Ex-Supervillain Lackey**

You weren’t the big bad, but you were in the room. You carried gear, built death rays, and managed lairs. You know how the villain playbook works, and maybe you’re still playing it, just in a different way now.

**Former Sidekick**

You were trained by a bigger name, someone famous. Maybe they’re gone, maybe they turned. Either way, you’ve inherited their habits and some of their training. You shine in action scenes and dramatic legacy moments.

**Freelance Cryptid Hunter**

Before the world fell apart, you were chasing Bigfoot. Now you hunt even stranger things. This set helps in tracking, occult reasoning, and recognizing the signs of Supernatural weirdness before it kills you.

**Gadgeteer Tinkerer**

You're not a full-on tech hero, but damn if duct tape and scavenged microchips don’t become something special in your hands. You shine when building gadgets under pressure or reverse-engineering enemy tech.

**Hollow-Eyed Lab Tech**

You worked in a lab, maybe on superhumans, maybe on something darker. You shine in medical scenes, genetic theory, or when diagnosing just what the hell went wrong with that survivor’s blood sample.

**Hunter of the In-Between**

You were trained to stalk what doesn’t want to be found. Whether beasts, criminals, or the supernatural, you know how to track, observe, and strike. You shine when patience matters more than firepower, and when others would already have lost the trail.

**I’ve Seen Empires Rise and Fall**

You’ve watched the world change, slowly, brutally, beautifully. Whether you’re two hundred years old or just extremely well-read and widely traveled, your perspective gives you an edge. You shine when recognizing patterns, understanding cultures, and navigating crises with the calm of someone who’s seen worse.

**Legacy Technician**  
You didn’t invent the tech, but you’ve inherited it, maintained it, and quietly improved it. Whether it was alien, magical, or just genius-level engineering, you’ve kept it functional. You excel in maintenance under pressure, repurposing powerful devices, and knowing just enough to avoid disaster.

**Masked Detective**  
You’ve read the files, walked through the alleys, and followed the threads. You’re not just tough, you’re sharp. Ideal for investigation, intuition, and unraveling schemes before anyone else sees them.

**Mystic Field Agent**  
You combine cold practicality with arcane insight. You’ve trained with sigils and firearms, read both alchemy and ops manuals. You’re not just a sorcerer, you’re a problem-solver with backup plans and backup weapons. You can read an omen and a room, then make both go quiet.

**Mystical Chosen**  
You didn’t ask for your powers; they were bestowed. This set emphasizes intuition, fate-reading, and ritualistic traditions. You shine when interpreting omens, communicating with spirits, or invoking supernatural rules.

**Parkour Courier**  
When the streets were choked with traffic, checkpoints, or chaos, you ran. Rooftops, fire escapes, shattered overpasses, you turned the city into your track. You know how to move fast, fluid, and unnoticed. You shine when outrunning danger, navigating urban terrain, or slipping through tight zones without ever setting foot on the street.

**Superhero Support Specialist**

You weren’t the one in the spotlight, but you were the reason they kept going. Butler, handler, medic, counselor, quartermaster, call it what you will. You brewed the coffee, stitched the wounds, maintained the gear, and talked them down after the worst nights. You understand routine, resilience, and the thousand little things that keep a hero alive and sane. You shine when managing logistics, treating trauma (physical or emotional), and delivering just the right words, or tools, at the exact moment they’re needed.

**Super-Science Intern**  
You were never the lead genius, but you learned from the best. You’ve swept labs, dodged exploding prototypes, and watched brilliant minds work. Now you apply that half-learned brilliance on your own, with courage and duct tape.

**Trained by the Old Ways**  
Your knowledge doesn’t come from labs or manuals; it comes from scrolls, whispers, and rituals passed from one hand to another. You understand discipline, honor, and forces older than the Z plague. You shine in spiritual crises, mystical interference, and when modern tech fails.

**Trained Since Childhood**  
While other kids played, you practiced. Your guardians, harsh, strict, or distant, saw potential and molded it into precision. Now, your instincts are calibrated for combat, strategy, and survival under pressure. You don’t flinch. Don’t hesitate. You execute.

**Wheelman**  
You used to be the guy behind the wheel, the one they trusted when things got hot. You know how to move a vehicle like it’s an extension of your body, how to escape a tail, and when to slam the brakes so the guy behind you eats dashboard. You shine in high-speed situations, vehicular escapes, or making an old junker dance like its factory new.
