Let’s face it: not all of us can shoot lasers from our fingertips or
stop a bullet with our skin. The vast majority of us have a power or two
that gives us the confidence to put on a mask and fight crime. Powers
are what bystanders think of when they say “superhero,” and sometimes,
all that stands between being alive and being zombie chow is a power.

‘Course, our powers aren’t all accidents of birth or augmentation. The
Crimson Sorceress claimed her powers were magical, while GearJack built
his powers from junk at a scrap yard. The Bengal Tiger once told me his
Martial Arts were fueled with mystic energy. None of that mattered to
the zombies, of course; they Z’d all three of them just the same.

# \<h2\>Power Checks

Sometimes, you will be required to make a Power Check when attempting to
utilize a power. When a power check is called for, roll a d20 + your
powers modifier + its primary ability score modifier. Not all powers
utilize power checks; some powers may have different uses, requiring
skill checks or utilizing a different ability score.

#### \<h3\>Passive Power DC

Some powers will refer to a passive power DC calculated like a passive
skill DC, 10 + Primary Ability Score Modifier + Power Score Modifier.
Any time a power calls for a saving throw, it is against the power’s
passive power DC.

#### \<h3\>Power Score Data Points

Like ability scores, powers share the same table to determine their
effects. Refer to the Ability/Power Score Table on pg. XX and Appendix
XX.

For example, someone with a Strength of 20 would have a +5 to hit and
damage in melee and be able to throw an object 7 areas, whereas a hero
with Energy Blast of 20 would have a +5 bonus to hit, base damage die of
d10, and a range of 10 areas.

The chart covers the basics for many powers; if the Power Description
gives an alternative benefit for Power Scores, it overrides the general
progression given.

#### \<h3\>Holding Back

Heroes and villains are not always required to use their full power. You
may choose to “pull your punch” and use power at a lower power score;
when you do so, you still use your total power score when making any
power check, but you can do less damage or reduce the number of areas
affected by a power.

# \<h2\>Power Descriptions and Signatures 

Many powers described herein have deliberately vague flavor text to
allow you, the player, to craft your Hero’s signature look. Some powers
(Speed, for example) allow for some creative flexibility. Whereas one
hero may slide on sheets of Ice she produces in front of him; another
hero may be the classic speedster.

It’s also worth noting that every Hero and villain possesses a
particular “power signature,” which is a specific look their power has
when used. Two fire manipulators can have two very different
manifestations. One may throw balls of flame at his targets, while the
other, surrounded by flames, might direct her flames to strike out in
quick whips against her opponents.

\<Sidebar\>

### Energy Types and Targeted Defense 

Many powers require you to key them to a particular type of energy; this
not only dictates the damage type but the defense attacked (see table
below)

| Energy Type | Description | Defense Attacked |
|:---|----|:--:|
| Acid | A corrosive substance that eats away at targets, causing melting or disintegration | Avoidance |
| Cold | Extreme cold or ice-based attacks that freeze or slow down targets. | Avoidance |
| Cosmic | The boundless energy of the universe itself, power that manipulates reality, space, and time. | Avoidance |
| Electricity | Electric shocks or discharges that deliver high-voltage damage to targets | Avoidance |
| Fire | Flames and intense heat which burn and scorch targets. | Avoidance |
| Kinetic | Physical impact or force-based attacks that rely on sheer momentum or concussive blows. | Avoidance |
| Light | Refers to attacks that harness the power of intense light to harm or hinder targets. | Avoidance |
| Radioactive | Ionizing radiation which melts objects, burns flesh, and causes cellular damage or radiation sickness. | Avoidance |
| Sonic | Sound-based attacks that utilize powerful vibrations or shockwaves to damage targets. | Fortitude |
| Psychic | Psychic damage is a form of mental assault that affects the target's mind, causing pain, confusion, or emotional distress. | Willpower |

Feel free to create new energy types, but be warned: if the selection is
too exotic, some powers will become too powerful while others might
become useless.

\</sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Power Sources and Effects

Powers come from various sources, and it is up to you to determine the
source of your powers, which is usually shaped by your origin and power
modifications given to each power. For example, your Energy Blast power
could result from mutated ocular blasts or a blaster pistol.

While each Hero possesses a power source, all the Hero’s powers are not
required to be part and parcel of that source.

## Power Modifications

As fully explained at the end of this section, Power Modifications
change how powers work and how they are used or accessed. These
modifiers are applied once you have purchased your starting powers.
Power modifications increase or decrease your power score.

## Power Stunts 

When you use a power often enough, you master its use in unique ways.
Kind of like how Basilisk can ricochet his energy beam off walls to hit
targets at crazy angles or how Flair can shift the power of her energy
sheath into a front-heavy shield, and don’t forget Cat5 how they had
such control over their wind powers that they were able to lift and move
small objects with ease.

There are two types of Power Stunts: *Emulated Powers* and *Power
Tricks.*

### \<h3\>Emulated Powers 

Some powers have a list of emulated powers, which are other powers you
can duplicate using that power. Emulated powers use the parent power’s
primary attribute and have a power score 6 points lower than the parent
power. Additionally, emulated powers inherit all of the parent power’s
modifications. You cannot, however, use an emulated power to emulate
other powers.

You can always propose new emulated powers, which your Editor-in-chief
must approve.

For instance, you may possess Move Object 20 and later learn to emulate
Energy Blast (Kinetic), which you would have at a Power Score of 14.

### \<h3\>Power Tricks 

Power tricks are innovative ways to use existing powers. Energy beams
ricocheting off a wall, using an energy blast on all the targets in an
area, or increasing the chance of a knockback at the cost of accuracy or
damage are just a few examples.

Power Tricks grant advantages or additional effects in exchange for
increasing the power’s burnout value, suffering Disadvantage, requiring
multiple actions, or applying penalties to hit or damage.

When you wish to perform a new Power Trick, you must first describe it
to your editor-in-chief, who then decides if it is possible, what its
effects are, what burnout costs are, and what any other modifications
are required.

We have created and presented a few in sidebars, among the powers
section below.

\<side bar\>

A Quick guide to understanding Power Tricks

*Powers:* The powers that may perform this power trick.

*Cost:* list of penalties that apply to the power trick.

*Effect:* The effect of using the power trick.

\</side bar\>

### \<h3\>Developing and Mastering Power Stunts 

When attempting to develop a new power stunt, you are limited to using
that power stunt once per scene at the cost of a plot point. When
developing a new power stunt, the editor-in-chief may require a power
check to perform it successfully; if such a roll is required, you are
only required to spend a plot point if the roll is successful.

Once you have performed a particular Power Stunt 10 times, the next time
you gain a feat, you may take the *Master Power Stunt* Feat to master
it, allowing you to use that stunt as many times as you wish without the
expenditure of a plot point.

Once you have mastered an Emulated Power, you may later separate an
emulated power from its parent power by using the *Master Emulated
Power* feat, making it a separate power that can now be increased
independently with all the parent power’s modifications.

Example: You possess Move Object:20 and Master the Emulated Power of
Energy Blast (Kinetic): 10. Later, you can take the *Master Emulated
Power* feat and choose to separate Energy Blast (Kinetic), making it an
independent power.

### \<h3\>Understanding Powers

Powers are presented in a universal format with entries as listed below.
If a power lacks a particular entry, it simply does not apply.

## \<Power Name\>

**Characteristic:** Continuous, Damaging, Interruptible, Melee, Ranged,
Scene

**Primary Ability:**

**Action:**

**Attack:**

**Burnout:**

*\<Descriptive flavor text\>*

**Effect:**

### Characteristics: 

Below is a list of possible characteristics. Sometimes, possible
limitations, such as Super-Human Only, may also be included*.*

*Continuous:* This power is continuous and does not need to be
activated.

*Damaging:* Powers with this characteristic deal your power’s base power
die + the power score modifier in damage as indicated by your power
score.

*Interruptible:* This use of this power is considered an *Interruptible*
action *(*See pg. XX).

*Ranged:* Any power with this characteristic is utilized at range.
Unless a static number of areas are noted (with 0 being the same area),
a ranged power’s range is equal to your power score modifier (minimum of
2) in areas. Also, unless otherwise noted, you must have a direct line
of sight to your intended target.

*Melee:* powers with a *Melee* characteristic may only be used against
targets in the same area.

*Scene:* Once this power is activated, it lasts until the end of the
Scene. Powers with this duration may be shut off at the hero’s
discretion before the end of the scene as a bonus action on their turn.

### Primary Ability:

All powers possess a Primary Ability, which is utilized when you are
required to perform a Power Check. If two ability scores are listed,
upon acquiring the power, you must pick one; once chosen, you cannot
change the power’s Primary Ability.

### Action: 

The action required to utilize this power.

### Attack:

The Defense targeted by the power; any attack that attacks the target’s
Avoidance requires either the *Ranged* or *Melee* attack roll. Powers
that attack the target’s Fortitude or Discipline require a *Power*
attack roll.

### Burnout:

In Rotted Capes, the continued use of some powers causes stress and
fatigue, leading to the phenomenon referred to as *burnout*.

As you use your powers, you must keep track of your burnout score. Your
total accumulated burnout is reduced by 1 each time you complete a turn
without using powers with a burnout cost.

However, any time you start your turn with an accumulated Burnout above
your Burnout Threshold, you must make a Burnout check by rolling a d20.
You must succeed or find that you can’t use any of your power’s burnout
value for the remainder of the scene.

The DC of your Burnout Check starts at a DC:10 but increases by 5 every
time you are forced to make a burnout check during that scene to a
maximum of DC: 20.

At the end of the scene, your accumulated burnout is commonly reduced to
0 if there are a few moments for you to catch your breath unless the
Editor-in-Chief has other plans.

\<side bar\>

#### \<h4\>Optional Rule: Taping your Maximum Potential

Commonly, you cannot benefit from a score above your rank cap. But under
specific circumstances, you might be able to tap into your untapped
potential.

With the Editor-In-Chief’s approval, a hero can tap into their untapped
potential for one action or reaction by expending a plot point; after
you take this action, you pay enough burnout to surpass your burnout
threshold by 1 if you are already past your burnout threshold you make
all Burnout Check with Disadvantage till the end of the scene. Such
instances should be rare, perhaps under extreme duress or extraordinary
circumstances.  
\<side bar\>

***External Power Sources:*** Some powers may have their own Burnout
Threshold due to an external power source. Burnout of each power source
is tracked separately. If you fail a Burnout Check with such a power
source, all powers that use that power source, regardless of whether it
has a burnout value, become inert until the end of the scene.

\<Side Bar\>

**Hard Core Alternate Rule: Burnout and Exhaustion  **

Each time you successfully resist burning out (e.g., rolling higher than
the threshold on a Burnout check), you gain a level of Exhaustion.
Exhaustion represents the physical and mental strain of pushing your
powers to the limit. The levels of Exhaustion have cumulative effects on
your character, such as penalties to ability checks, pace, and combat
abilities. These effects can be detailed on page XX, and the specific
penalties can increase with each additional level of Exhaustion gained.

\</Side Bar\>

## Retaining Powers Scene to Scene 

Powers with the *Scene* characteristic may be retained from scene to
scene. If you choose to keep a power active, you start the new scene
with an amount of burnout as if they had just activated their power.

## \<h2\>Power Descriptions

### \<h3\>Aquatic Adaptation 

**Primary Ability:** Constitution

*You possess the incredible ability to adapt to underwater environments,
granting you enhanced swimming abilities and the ability to hold your
breath for extended periods of time.*

**Effect:** You gain a swim pace equal to your power score modifier and
the ability to hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your
power score. Additionally, you gain the ability to see clearly in murky
water, making it easier to navigate and interact with underwater
environments.

**Power Stunts:**

Emulated Power: *Life Support:* Breathing underwater only

### \<h3\>Absorb Energy

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Constitution

*You can use the energy of incoming attacks to boost your potential.*

**Effect:** Choose an energy type, such as cold, fire, or kinetic, that
you can absorb. Additionally, select either an ability score or power
that this power can boost.

When you suffer damage of the chosen energy type, the ability score or
power you've selected is temporarily boosted by an amount equal to the
damage suffered, up to a maximum of your Absorb Energy's power score
modifier. This boost remains in effect until the end of your next turn.

If both your Absorb Energy and the power it boosts are *linked* (see
power modifications on Pg. xx), Absorbed Energy also grants you Damage
Resistance (DR) against the chosen energy type, equal to your power
score modifier while still boosting your chosen power.

**Note:** If you suffer damage from the chosen energy type multiple
times between turns, only the highest boost is considered for the
ability score or power.

For example, Plastinex has the power Energy Absorption (Kinetic): 20,
which boosts her Energy Blast (Kinetic): 16. After she takes her turn,
she gets punched by zombie and takes 2 points of kinetic damage,
boosting her Elemental/Energy Blast to 18, and right after gets hit by a
garbage bin thrown by an abomination taking 10 points of kinetic damage,
boosting her Elemental/Energy Blast to 21 until the end of her next turn
(as her power score modifier is +5)

**Special (Access):** You can take this power multiple times, choosing
either a different energy type *or* a different ability/power into which
the absorbed energy is channeled, with each power tracked separately. If
you have multiple powers that can be empowered by the same energy type
any time you suffer damage of that type, you must choose which
ability/power takes the absorbed damage.

**Special (Unique Power Modification):  **
*Explosive Limitation (+2 flaw):* As an optional power modification
unique to this ability, you may choose to have an absorption limit. If
you take more damage of your chosen damage type than your power score
between turns, you risk having an explosive burst. At the beginning of
your turn, make a constitution saving throw against a DC equal to the
total damage taken. Upon a successful check, you control your power and
may proceed as usual. Upon a failed check, you explode as an action,
making a single power attack roll against the Avoidance of everyone in
your area. Creatures you hit suffer your Power Score Die in the same
damage you absorbed, with creatures you missed (and you) suffering half
as much damage. Items in the area suffer this damage as if they were
being directly attacked (see destroying items pg. XX)

### \<h3\>Absorb Matter 

Scene

**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom or Charisma

**Action:** Bonus

**Burnout:** 8

*You can touch something - a length of wood, a chunk of stone, a piece
of twisted metal - and gain the properties of the substance.*

**Effect:** By touching a natural or manufactured substance, you can
gain the resilience of that substance (see Attacking and Destroying
Objects pg. XX). You can only absorb the properties of solid objects.
Thus, this power will not let you absorb the qualities of air, fire,
water, etc. By advancing in power score, you can absorb the properties
of tougher and stronger materials. The table below shows the minimum
power score needed to absorb a particular substance (or its equivalent).

If unusual objects or substances are not listed, the Editor-in-Chief
will decide what benefits you gain. For example, touching the sheet
metal exterior of a car might qualify as aluminum, while touching an
armored composite material might qualify as iron. Touching glass has no
effect, but certain forms of armored glass might qualify as anything
from ceramics to brick (and so on). You must pay the Burnout cost each
time you touch a new substance.

You may only fully absorb materials with an MS equal to or below your
power score. If you attempt to absorb material with a higher MS, you
will maximize your power’s potential instead.

You gain modifiers to your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution
depending on the material you absorbed or your power score on the chart
below, whichever is lower.

</table>

*For example,* Sponge possesses Absorb Material: 14; before entering a
room, he touches the floor, taking on the properties of the ceramic
tiles, gaining a +1 bonus to his strength and constitution, and paying 5
Burnout. Walking up a set of stairs, he realizes that the rails on the
side of the staircase are made of Iron, paying another 5 Burnout. But,
instead of absorbing Iron, he caps out power score, gaining +2 Strength
and +4 Constitution until the end of the scene.

**Special (Unique Power Modifications):**

*Appearance (+0 Flaw):* You take on the look like the substances you
absorb.

*Slow as Stone (+2 Flaw):* You get slower the stronger material you
absorb; your pace is reduced by the number of points you gain in
Strength to a minimum of 1 area.

*Absorb Material Strength (-4 Perk):* You gain DR against physical
damage equal to the MS of the material you absorb or 2+ your power score
modifier, whichever is lower.

### \<h3\>Adoptive Muscle Memory

Scene

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Action/Bonus

**Burnout:** 8/2

*You possess the extraordinary ability to rapidly learn and replicate
physical skills and feats you observe in action.*

**Effect:** You can replicate the use of any physical skill (those
relying on Strength or Dexterity) or any Feat you witness in action. To
adopt a skill or feat, you must observe it in person (within 2 areas) or
by watching it on video. Once you've observed a skill or feat you wish
to adopt, you may use an Action and pay 8 Burnout to commit it to
memory. You may memorize a total number of feats/skills equal to half
your power score modifier. If you wish to adopt a new skill or feat and
have reached your limit, you can choose to replace one of your
previously adopted skills or feats.

Once you have adopted a skill/feat as a bonus action, you can recall it
for the remainder of the scene, paying 2 Burnout.

Newly adopted skills are adopted at the hero rank you observed the skill
being used at or your power score modifier, whichever is lower. You
start play with one adopted feat or skill of your choice, which is
acquired at a +1 rank bonus.

Example: KopyKat has Adoptive Muscle Memory with a Power Score of 18.
She witnesses a bystander using the Larceny skill with a +2 rank bonus
to pick a lock. If KopyKat chooses to learn the skill, she pays 8
Burnout, but she is initially limited to a +2 bonus in the skill, even
though her Power Score Modifier is +4. After months, KopyKat raised her
Adoptive Muscle Memory score to 24; she can recall the Larceny skill for
2 Burnout, but she is still capped at the +2 rank bonus she acquired the
skill at initially.

### \<h3\>Animate Object 

Scene, Melee

**Primary Attribute:** Charisma

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 8/2

*You possess the extraordinary ability to bring non-living matter to
life and command objects to perform tasks on your behalf.*

**Effect:** By touch, you can animate objects of medium or smaller size
with a Material Strength (MS) equal to or less than your power score.
Once animated, you provide a simple command to the object, which it
follows to the best of its ability. After completing the task, the
object becomes motionless until the end of the scene, or you issue a new
command. Initiating object animation requires an action and 8 Burnout,
but issuing a new command is a bonus action for 2 Burnout.

You can include stipulations in a command, but the number of
stipulations cannot exceed your power score modifier. For instance, if
Mara Yaga aims to animate a bucket of water to fill her bathtub, she
might initially command the bucket to "Fill the tub." However, to ensure
specificity, she would need to say "Fill the tub with water" (requiring
a power score of at least 14) or even more detail like "Fill the tub
with hot water" (requiring two qualifiers) and "Fill the tub with hot
water until I tell you to stop" (requiring a score of 16).

You can animate only one object at a time; starting a new animation ends
the previous one. As your power score increases, you can animate larger
objects—large-sized objects at a power score of 20 and huge-sized
objects at a power score of 30.

Animated objects possess a Strength and Dexterity score equal to your
Charisma score. They have an Avoidance and Fortitude defense of 12 but
lack a Willpower defense as they lack consciousness. Animated objects
use Material Strength (MS) instead of Stamina and Wounds, with their
mental abilities all 0 unless affected by the Imbue Consciousness Power.
When commanded to attack, animated objects execute basic melee attacks
with a total bonus to hit equal to your power score modifier, dealing
damage based on your power score's base die (Kinetic, Slashing, or
Piercing).

This power functions solely on non-living, non-sentient objects. Please
note that zombies and other undead creatures are considered "living" for
the purpose of this power.

**Special (Synergy):** You may take the synergy power modification
synergizing Animate Object and Imbue Consciousness.

**Special (Combining Effects):** You can combine this power with Animate
Object and Imbue Consciousness using both powers simultaneously for 10
burnout.

### \<h3\>Armor

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Constitution or Dexterity

*You possess a level of protection from physical attacks.*

**Effect:** You possess Damage Reduction (DR) equal to your power score
modifier against Physical Damage. This power is significantly less
effective against energy attacks, granting you only half your power
score modifier against Energy Damage and no DR against attacks that deal
Psychic or Poison damage.

### \<h3\>Bestial Transformation

Scene

Primary Ability: Constitution

**Action:** Action

Burnout: 6

*You can shapeshift into an animal.*

**Effect:** You can change your shape to become any animal of medium
size. You retain your Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
ability scores, Feats, Defenses, and Stamina/Wounds, but replace your
Strength and Dexterity scores with that of the animal, as well as
gaining the animal’s Attacks, natural abilities and Pace.

While using this power, all your equipment melds into your new form
(becoming unusable for the duration of this ability).

You can change into the form of any animal you have personally seen; you
start play with a number of animal forms equal to half your Power Score
Modifier.

**Special (Combining Effects):** You can combine this power with Growth
and Shrinking Powers to take animal forms of different sizes. When doing
so, you only pay one-half the Burnout from both powers, rounded up. For
example, taking the form of a large animal would give you 6 burnout (3
for Growth and 3 for Bestial Transformation).

**Special (Unique Power Modification):**

*Limitation (+2 flaw):* Limit your power to a single animal type (For
example, dogs)

*Limitation (+2 flaw):* May only take on a hybrid form (see power trick:
hybrid form below) instead of animal forms.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* You may learn both Enhanced Attribute (Dexterity) and
Enhanced Attribute (Strength), but these are restricted to use in your
animal or hybrid form (see below). Additionally, you may learn Chameleon
and Multiple Limbs, but only if appropriate to beast or hybrid form.

*Power Trick: Hybrid Form*

You may learn a single hybrid animal form (a cross between animal and
man, like the classic movie Werewolf). When you take a hybrid form, you
gain the animal’s strength and dexterity scores if they are higher than
yours. Also, any time you take your hybrid form, you may choose two of
the following: the creature’s pace, attacks, or natural abilities. For
example, if you take the form of the wolf-man mentioned above, you may
choose the wolf's pace and bite attack or the wolf’s pace and natural
abilities of enhanced senses (smell) and senses (hearing). Supernatural
creatures who take this power learn this power trick automatically know
this power trick.

### \<h3\>Botanokinesis

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence

**Action: Action**

**Burnout:** 5

*You can mentally summon, control, and manipulate plants and
vegetation.*

**Effect:** With Botanokinesis, you can manipulate plants and vegetation
in various ways, utilizing your power score as a measure of your control
and effectiveness. Some possible applications of this power include:

- **Plant Manipulation:** You can mentally control plants' growth,
  movement, and shape within a radius equal to your power score modifier
  in areas. You can make them grow rapidly, change their shape, or even
  animate them to perform simple tasks. You can also command plants to
  entangle or restrain targets, using your power score instead of
  *Athletics* skill with a strength equal to your power score.

- **Plant Growth:** By channeling your power, you can accelerate the
  growth and maturation of plants, causing them to sprout, bloom, and
  bear fruits or flowers almost instantaneously. This ability allows you
  to create obstacles or difficult terrain by rapidly growing dense
  vegetation.

- **Healing and Restoration:** You can heal and restore plants, mending
  damaged foliage, accelerating recovery from diseases or pests, and
  revitalizing wilted or dying vegetation.

- **Environmental Influence:** You can manipulate the local environment
  to a limited extent. You can generate localized changes in temperature
  and humidity, create areas of shade or sunlight, or even purify the
  air by enhancing the plant's natural filtration capabilities.

**Special (Limitation):** Your control over plants is limited to
existing vegetation and cannot create new plants or generate plant life
from nothing. The effectiveness and size of your manipulation depend on
the availability and proximity of suitable plant life in the area.

**Special (Synergy):** You may take synergy power modification,
synergizing Botanokinesis and Communicate with Plants.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Communicate with Plants, Chameleon (by manipulating
plants to create natural camouflage to conceal yourself), Energy Blast
(Kinetic, hitting with rapidly growing roots), Entangle, Move Object,
Poison.

### \<h3\>Broadcast 

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence

**Action: Action** (to tune in)

**Burnout:** 5 (to broadcast for one Scene)

You can tune in to electromagnetic broadcasts.

**Effect:** By taking an action to “tune in” to a particular frequency,
you can pick up electromagnetic communication such as radio, television,
and wireless LAN broadcasts in your area. At higher Power Scores, you
can also broadcast on your chosen frequency to a distance equal to your
power score modifier x1000 feet. This broadcast is considered the
strongest transmission within this range, replacing any other broadcasts
on that frequency. As you increase your power score, you can receive
visual communications, “seeing” them in your mind and even broadcast
visual communications, either broadcasting what you see or constructing
simple images in your imagination.

The Editor-in-Chief may require skill checks to construct or alter
complex visual images. Making visual images that look realistic should
at least require a Daunting (DC:25) skill check. Images being
transmitted unaltered from what you see never require a skill check.

| Power Score | Capability |
|----|----|
| 10-11 | Receive shortwave radio broadcasts. |
| 12-13 | Receive all radio broadcasts. |
| 14-15 | Broadcast shortwave radio broadcasts |
| 16-17 | Broadcast all radio broadcasts. |
| 18-20 | Receive all wireless electromagnetic communications, including visual and wireless LAN. |
| 21-25 | Broadcast all audio wireless electromagnetic communications. |
| 26-29 | Receive all electromagnetic communications, wireless or not, in your area. |
| 30-39 | Broadcast all wireless electromagnetic communications, including visual and wireless LAN. |
| 40+ | Broadcast all electromagnetic communications, wireless or not, in your area. These broadcasts interrupt and replace any broadcasts going through wired systems. |

### \<h3\>Cat Fall 

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Dexterity

**Speed:** Reaction

*You can fall greater distances than normal and usually land on your
feet.*

**Effect:** Any time you fall, you may, as a reaction, reduce the damage
you take from a fall by reducing the number of areas “fallen” by your
power score modifier +1. If you reduce the damage to 0, you land on your
feet.

### \<h3\>Celerity

**Primary Ability:** Dexterity

**Action:** Special (See Below)

**Burnout:** 5

*You may perform actions with amazing Dexterity*

**Effect:** You may reduce the speed of any action by one step, from
*Demanding Action* to *Action* or *Action* to *Bonus Action.*
Additionally, you may use this ability to take a second *Reaction*
before the start of your next turn. This power is particularly taxing;
you may use this power a number of times equal to your power score
modifier before requiring a long rest.

**For Example:**

Celerity finds himself facing two scavengers armed with shotguns. Going
first, he chooses to reduce the cost of his Attack Action to Bonus
Action, allowing him to attack one of the scavengers with his Katana,
gaining 5 points of burnout. After this, he can attack the same
scavenger or even the other with his action.

After the scavenger’s actions, where both of them used their very loud
shotguns, Celerity decides it’s better to get the heck out of dodge as
the noise of those two shotguns will start attracting Z’s from all over
the place. So, he starts his turn by choosing to attack one scavenger
with his action and then take the dash action, bringing his total
burnout to 10.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers*: Temporal Fugue

### \<H3\>Chameleon 

Scene

**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom

**Speed:** Action

**Burnout:** 4

*You can take on the colors of the world around you.*

**Effect:** The power allows you to blend into your surroundings,
provided you’re not moving (or moving very slowly). Once you activate
this power, you gain a bonus for stealth (dexterity) skill checks equal
to your power score modifier. This power works best if you don’t move,
as you usually can’t adapt to your changing surroundings quickly enough
to remain blended in. If you move more than 1 area per turn, you only
gain half your power score modifier to your Stealth (Dexterity) skill
checks.

When you use this power, you must have something to blend into—the
Editor-in-Chief may ask for a Power Check versus the DC of your
surroundings to blend in. Note that nearly empty, very plain, or
monochromatic areas will be far easier to disappear into than very
colorfully cluttered areas or backgrounds with moving colors (LED
screens and the like, moving smoke, and so on).

### \<h3\>Communicate with Animals 

Continuous, Ranged (0)

**Primary Ability:** Charisma

*You can communicate with animals.*

**Effect:** You can communicate telepathically with animals of all
kinds. You may communicate with a few animal types equal to half your
power score modifier.

This power does not allow for complex communication at first. When this
power is in use, you imbue animals with an echo of your sentience; as
such, you increase an animal’s effective intelligence by half your power
score modifier, rounded down to a minimum of 1.

So, if you possess Communicate with Animals: 14, you would increase the
target animal’s intelligence by +2. Keep in mind that Mammals,
Cetaceans, and Primates are capable of conveying much more complex
thoughts.

**Animal Type**

Cetaceans

Primates

Marsupials

Birds

Reptiles

Fish

Amphibians

Arachnids

Insects

Mollusks

> Echinoderms
>
> Annelids

**Special (Unique Power Modification)**

*Limitation Power Flaw (+2/+4/+8):* You may limit this power to a
particular habitat or animal type. Limiting communications to land-based
animals is a +2 flaw while limiting communications to marine or alien
animals would be a +4 flaw. Alternately, a Hero could limit the power to
one of the types listed above, allowing them to ONLY communicate with
that category of animals and gain a +8 bonus to the power’s starting
power score.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Summon Animal

### \<H3\>Communicate with Plants 

Continuous, Ranged

**Primary Attribute:** Charisma

**Action: Action**

**Burnout:** 5

*You possess the ability to potentially communicate telepathically with
plants of all kinds.* **Effect:** This power works a little differently
than Communication with Animals as it imparts a shard of sentience upon
the target, defined as an echo of your consciousness. You may
communicate with a number of plant types equal to half your power score
modifier.

**Plant types**

Trees

Ferns

Weeds

Grasses

Flowering Plants

Moss and Fungus

> Algae
>
> Lichens

This power does not allow for complex communication at first. Even when
imbued with an echo of your sentience, the plant’s effective
intelligence of half your power score modifier rounded down to a minimum
of 1. So, if you possess Communicate with Plants: 14, you would imbue
the target plant (such as a fern) with an intelligence of 2, while
someone with a power score of 30 in this power would grant the plant an
intelligence of 5, roughly equal to that of a below average human.

**Special (Unique Power Modification)**

*Limitation Power Flaw (+2/+6):* You may limit this power to a
particular habitat. Limiting communications to land-based plants is a +2
Flaw while limiting communications to marine or alien plants would be a
+6 Flaw. Alternatively, you could limit the power to one of the
categories listed above, such as Trees, Flowering Plants, or Moss,
allowing them to ONLY communicate with that plant category and gain a +8
bonus to the power’s starting power score.

**Special (Synergy):** You may take synergy power modification,
synergizing Botanokinesis and Communicate with Plants.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Botanokinesis

### \<h3\>Control Weather 

Interruptible, Ranged, Scene

**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom

**Action: Action**

**Burnout:** 5

*You can change the weather. You can make it rain on a sunny day, call
forth snow in the middle of summer, whip up tornadoes, and so on.*

**Effect:** With this power, you can alter local weather conditions in
various ways, with the extent of the change depending on your power
score. The greater your power score, the greater the weather changes you
can create. When controlling the weather, you lack precise control over
the weather and its effects. The best you can do is expand and reduce
the number of areas affected; you affect a minimum number of areas equal
to half your power score modifier and may affect a number of areas equal
to your total power score modifier.

You can cancel or mitigate the effects of local weather conditions (or
another use of this power) by performing a Power Check against a DC
equal to the score of the power used to create the weather you’re trying
to affect (for natural weather conditions, use the chart below to
determine the DC you need to overcome). For each point equal to or
beyond the DC, you can reduce the weather conditions by one row. The
following chart shows what affects you can create, the power score
required, and what damage these effects can inflict. Note that you can
create a lesser effect at a greater power score. The damage you do will
then be based on the Power Score Die of the new power score.

10-11: You can increase or decrease the ambient temperature. At the
beginning of every turn that a target is within the area of this effect,
they must make a constitution saving throw to avoid taking your power
score modifier in stamina damage. Creatures with the appropriate score
in Life Support are immune to this effect.

12-13: Create light rain, fog, snow, or a steady breeze. All creatures
in the areas you affect suffer a penalty equal to your power score
modifier to hearing (rain) or sight (snow/fog) based perception checks.
The breeze will push all unsecured objects with a weight equal to half
the amount listed in the max lift column for the power score used. Those
outside the area suffer the same penalty to see or hear into the
impacted area.

14-17: Create steady rain or snow or strong breezes and gusts of wind.
Creatures in the areas affected suffer your power score modifier to
either hearing (rain) or sight (snow) based perception checks. The wind
now pushes all unsecured objects with a weight equal to the amount
listed in the Max Lift column for the power score used. Objects with a
weight equal to half the amount listed in the Max Lift column are picked
up and hurled about. Roll a power attack against the Avoidance of all
creatures in the area, and any creature you hit suffers your Power Score
Die in kinetic damage.

18-20: Create medium to heavy rain or snow. Creatures in the areas
affected suffer your power score modifier to either hearing (rain) or
sight (snow) based perception checks. At this point, the rain can start
to wash small objects away or create flash flood conditions in confined
Areas. The snow can accumulate quickly enough to cover mud, grass,
gravel tracks, or ice over small bodies of still water.

21-29: Create heavy rains, snow, or strong, buffeting winds. Creatures
in the areas affected suffer your power score modifier to either hearing
(rain) or sight (snow) based perception skill checks. The rain can start
to push objects large objects around (up to and including trash
dumpsters and small cars) and easily wash out dirt or gravel roads,
while the weight of the accumulating snow can break tree branches and
collapse unsupported roofing. In addition, the rain and snow create
areas of difficult terrain if the weather is sustained for more than one
turn.

30-39: Create thunderstorms, snowstorms, or windstorms. Creatures in the
areas affected suffer a penalty to their hearing (rain) or sight (snow
of fog) based perception checks equal to your power score modifier. The
wind can now push unsecured objects with a weight equal to the amount
listed in the Push/Drag column for the power score used. Unsecured
objects with a weight equal to the amount listed in the Max Lift column
may be picked up and hurled about doing damage equal to the Power Score
Die to any targets in the affected area with a successful power attack
against the Avoidance of the creatures in the area. At this point, the
rain can create flash flood conditions in Areas with poor drainage,
while the snow can quickly create large drifts. The area affected is now
considered Difficult Ground. By the end of the turn, the power is used.
In addition, large snow drifts may count as Obstacles.

40+: Create blizzards, hurricanes, or tornadoes. At this point, the hero
can create some of the most destructive forms of weather possible.
Creatures in the areas affected suffer your power score modifier to
either hearing (rain) or sight (snow) based perception checks. That
said, blizzards can create white-out conditions, where it is nearly
impossible to see clearly, while the howl of tornadoes may make it
impossible to hear. The winds created by a hurricane can push objects
with a weight equal to the amount listed in the Push/Drag column for the
power score used. Tornadoes can pick up objects with a weight equal to
the amount listed in the Max Lift column. In both cases, Objects with a
weight equal to the amount listed in the Max Lift column may be picked
up and hurled about doing damage equal to the Power Score Die to all
creatures in the affected area with a successful power attack against
the Avoidance of the creatures in the area. As with Rank 30-39 storms,
the area affected is now considered Difficult Ground by the end of the
turn. In addition, large snow drifts may count as Obstacles. Finally,
the various weather effects noted under the previous ranks (such as
flash flooding, washing out areas, snow collapsing structures, and
freezing water) apply.

**Special (Unique Power Modifications):**  
*Limitations +2/+4:* You can limit your power to a specific type of
weather. For example, if you can only create various forms of wind (up
to and including tornadoes), this is a +2 flaw. If you can only make it
hot (or cold), then it’s a +4 flaw.

**Power Stunts**

*Emulated Powers:* Energy Blast (electrical, lighting bolts), Move
Object (controlled use of wind to move items)

### \<h3\>Convert Matter

Interruptible, Melee, Scene

**Primary Ability:** Intelligence

**Action:** Demanding

**Burnout:** 5

*You can convert non-living matter into another type of non-living
matter.*

**Effect:** You can convert non-living matter into another type of
non-living matter. The weight of the matter converted is determined by
your Power Score, which is one-fourth of your power score Max Lift. For
example, someone with Convert Matter: 20 could convert 200 lbs. of
material. Organic matter is okay so long as it is not alive (you can
convert a wooden door into a metal chair but not a trash dumpster into a
tree). Both the matter being converted and the new matter must be mainly
of the same substance, with the rest just dropping away (so transforming
a wooden door into a metal shield would gain you a metal shield and a
doorknob since the doorknob was already metal and thus not converted).

You may automatically convert objects from or into a substance with a
Material Strength equal to or below your passive power DC. Alternately,
you may attempt to convert objects with a higher material strength with
a successful Power Check against a DC equal to the target object’s
material strength.

Items revert to their original shape/material at the end of the scene.
With the permission of the Editor-in-Chief, an item may be made
permanent with the expenditure of a Plot Point.

For example, if you possessed Convert Matter: 15 and had an Intelligence
of 14, you may attempt to convert Titanium (MS: 30) into Steel (MS: 20)
with a successful Power Check DC: 30.

For more examples of the MS of specific objects and materials, see
Attacking and Destroying Objects, pg. XX.

**Special (Undead):** Undead creatures, such as the ubiquitous zombies,
count as “alive” for purposes of this power.

**Crafting Items with emulated powers:**

With this power, you can create gear and equipment on the fly by
emulating *Manifest Gear* and/or *Inventive gadgetry.*

*\<side bar\>*

Creative Use of Convert material may sometimes constitute “changing a
scene” and require the use of a plot point; this is not always the case,
but such requirements are left up to the editor-in-chief.

\</side bar\>

### \<h3\>Damaging Form 

Scene

**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom

**Action: Bonus**

**Burnout:** 5

*It hurts to hit you.*

**Effect:** Choose an Energy (except Psychic damage. See below); as a
bonus action, you surround yourself with a damaging field of your chosen
energy type. Any creature that hits you with a melee attack or starts
its turn grappling you suffers your Power Score Die damage. In the case
of kinetic energy, you may be so dense (or invulnerable) that hitting
you hurts, or you may have a body covered with spikes or the like.

**Special (psychic shields):** Alternately, you may choose psychic
energy as your energy type; if you do, this power is only effective
against psychic attacks. Any attacker who deals psychic damage to you or
attempts to control your mind is damaged by this power. Due to the
limited scope of this power, you also add your wisdom modifier to the
damage dealt.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Energy Sheath

### \<h3\>Darkness

Ranged (0)

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 3

*You seem to emanate darkness from your body, and with it, you may
control the brightness of an area or plunge it into pitch blackness.*

**Effect:** You can project darkness from your body. This is not the
absence of light per se but a unique energy conjured from an unknown
dimension.

With this power, you lower the illumination (see pg. XX) of the area you
are in plus a number of adjacent areas equal to half your Power Score
Modifier (Minimum of 1) by one step. (for example, bright light to
shadowy) You may further reduce the illumination by reducing the maximum
number of areas you can affect by 2 for each additional step. (Reducing
an area from bright light to total darkness would be 2 steps, reducing
the number of areas you can affect by 2)

Any time a Power that produces light is brought into or activated within
an area you are affecting, you must make a Power Check against a DC
equal to that power’s passive power DC. Non-powered light sources (such
as flashlights) have a DC equal to the number of areas of bright light
they produce +10. If successful, the new light source increases the
illumination level within its area by one step. Still, it can’t
penetrate beyond that, with failure resulting in the light source
behaving normally within its area and affecting only 1 area beyond that.

Interestingly, this power also grants you the ability to see perfectly
through your darkness, as if you possessed the power of Super Sense at
an equal Power Score.

**Special (Access):** You may learn Elemental/Energy Manipulation
(Darkness), allowing you to shape the darkness you generate into a
physical form. You may also learn a special kind of Super Sense
(Darkness Sense) that would allow you to see within the darkness effects
of others and listen into the areas of any area you are affecting with
your power. Unless you possess the Darkness power, you may *not* acquire
Elemental/Energy Manipulation (Darkness) or Super Sense (Darkness Sense)

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Power:* Energy Manipulation (Darkness), Environmental
Manipulation (shadows), Super Sense (Darkness Sense)

### \<h3\>Deflection 

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Strength or Dexterity

**Action:** Reaction

**Burnout:** 3 each attack deflected

*You can knock away incoming attacks.*

**Effect:** When you are the target of a ranged attack, you may make
Power Check and compare the result to the result of the attack roll
against you. If you are successful, you deflect away damage equal to
your power score; you take any damage remaining, which DR may further
reduce.

**Special (Unique Power Modifications):**

*Limited Defection (+2/+6):* You can use this Flaw to define what you
can deflect. Deflect bullets would be worth +2 (everyone has bullets),
while if you can only deflect laser beams, such a flaw may be worth +6.

**Power Stunts:**

*Power Trick:* Reflection

\<Side Bar\>

### Power Trick: Reflection 

**Powers:** Deflection

**Cost:** +5 Burnout

**Attack:** Avoidance

**Effect:** When you successfully deflect an incoming attack, you may
reflect that damage to any creature within range of the attacking power
with a successful attack roll.

\</Side Bar\>

### \<h3\>Density Control 

Scene

**Primary Attribute:** Constitution

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 5

*You can increase your mass, becoming physically denser and harder to
hurt.*

**Effect:** You may increase your mass to a level dictated by your power
score (see the accompanying chart). When you do so, increase your
Strength by half your power score modifier; you gain DR equal to your
power score modifier against Physical damage attacks.

The following chart gives a rough idea of your character’s mass when
purchasing Density Control.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 10%" />
<col style="width: 89%" />

</tbody>
</table>

**Note:** Becoming supermassive on certain surfaces may result in your
crashing right through the floor. At the end of every turn, roll your
modified Strength Attribute Die and Power Score Die and apply the result
against the Material Strength of the floor; if you surpass the amount of
Hits on the surface you’re walking on, you fall through the floor. See
Attacking and Destroying Objects pg. XX

### \<h3\>Duplicate

Scene (or special, see below)

**Primary Ability:** Charisma

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 8

*There are more of you. This power allows you to do the work of two men.
Or ten!*

**Effect:** You can create an identical copy of yourself. While capable
of independent thought, you and your copy usually work in tandem with
each other. Each dup has all your characteristics but none of your gear
(except clothing). Also, dubs don’t have a burnout threshold, so they
cannot use any power with a burnout cost. Each dup has stamina equal to
your power score, possesses one wound, and can telepathically
communicate with you and each other within a number of miles equal to
your power score modifier (min of 1).

When you activate this power, you create a number of dups equal to half
your power score modifier (minimum of 1) and may dismiss them at any
time as a bonus action. Any time one of these dups “pops” out of
existence due to being butchered, it causes a psionic bio-feedback loop,
leaving you and any remaining dups shaken (See combat, pg. XX) until the
beginning of your next turn.

At the end of the scene, all duplicates instantly recombine with you,
regardless of range; you gain all of your dup’s memories.

If one of your dups is Z’d, it will not recombine automatically as it
has been substantially changed. However, until it is destroyed, your
Burnout Threshold is reduced by 10, and it will continue to count as a
duplicate you created, although you no longer have any control over it.

Alternatively, you may create a single dup, which may be kept in
existence for an indefinite amount of time. As long as that dup exists,
you cannot access this power, and your Burnout Threshold is reduced by
10.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Multiple Limbs

### \<h3\>Dynamic Power

Scene

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

*You have an interesting knack for having the right power at the right
time.*

**Effect:** This power allows you to emulate one or more powers whose
total power score is equal to your power score of this power -6. You may
choose your powers at the start of the scene or start the scene without
any powers and choose them on the fly at the cost of a plot point. Your
chosen powers remain as selected until the end of the scene. At the
editor-in-chief’s discretion, you may be allowed to switch powers
mid-scene in life-or-death situations at the cost of a plot die, such as
being thrown off a building.

### \<h3\>Eidetic Memory 

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence

**Action: Action**

*Commonly referred to as photographic memory, Eidetic Memory is a
psychological or medical term popularly defined as the ability to recall
images, sounds, or objects in memory with extreme precision.*

**Effect:** This power grants the following benefits

- You gain a bonus to all Intelligence-based skill checks equal to half
  your power score modifier.

- You may attempt to recall useful information to help you with the task
  at hand. Roll a power check against the DC of any skill check +5; if
  successful, you gain an Advantage on that skill check.

- Recall a scene you have witnessed, a location you may have visited, or
  even something you may have read, which you do so with picture-perfect
  clarity.

**Special (Additional Skill Uses):** After recalling a scene, location,
or something you read, the Editor-in-Chief may ask you to perform an
Investigation (Intelligence) skill check to notice particular details
about what you remember.

**Power Stunts:**  
*Power Trick:* Total Recall

### \<h3\>Elasticity 

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Constitution

**Action:** Bonus or Reaction

**Burnout:** None / 3

*Your body has rubber-like elasticity. You can expand and contract limbs
and gain some protection from your body stretching during an attack.*

**Effect:** This power has two effects: a Continuous effect and an
Activated effect.

- **Continuous Effect:** You can absorb more damage than most due to
  your elastic nature. You possess gain DR against Physical damage equal
  to your power score modifier. This effect has no burnout and is
  permanently active.

- **Activated Effect:** You may stretch any part of your body out a
  number of areas equal to your power score modifier. However, doing so
  may expose you to possible attacks. This does allow you to make
  *Melee* attacks from that number of areas away. You may also use this
  power to take on shapes, such as a ball, or a parachute. As noted, you
  may use this activation as a reaction in conjunction with an
  opportunity attack or a situation where changing your shape would be
  advantageous (such as falling and being able to turn into a
  parachute).

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Catfall, Enhanced Attack, Multiple Limbs

### \<h3\>Emotion Control

Scene, Ranged

**Primary Ability:** Charisma

**Attack:** Discipline

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 4

*You can influence the emotional states of others.*

**Effect:** Select an emotion. You can instill this emotion into a
target with a successful Power Attack versus the target’s Willpower. You
can also specify to whom the target feels the emotion. The
Editor-in-Chief determines any situational modifiers (advantage or
disadvantage) for your attack roll depending on the current emotional
state of your target. For example, if Cara is deeply in love with
Randall, you may suffer Disadvantage if you try to make Cara feel malice
towards Randall.

If you instill emotions towards you, you gain a bonus to any
charisma-based skill check equal to your power’s Passive Modifier. For
example, feelings of admiration or trust may give you a bonus on Empathy
skill checks. Instilling feelings of fear or distrust might give you a
bonus on Influence skill check when attempting to intimidate someone.

The number of targets you may affect with this power is equal to your
power score modifier and may only install a number of different emotions
equal to half your power score modifier.

With a successful attack, you may instead choose to instill the
*charmed* or *frightened* condition on a single target until the end of
the scene. Affected creatures get a Charisma saving throw at the end of
their turn to end this effect.

This is a mental power, and as such, it does not work on zombies or
non-sentient targets.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Weaken (Mental Attributes only)

*Power Tricks:* Aura of Fear, Influence the Masses

\<Sidebar\>

### \<h3\> Power Tricks

####  \<h4\> Aura of Fear

**Powers:** Emotion Control

**Cost:** +3 Burnout

**Effect:** You may use your power to *frighten* mobs of bystanders
until the end of the scene. To do so, perform a single attack against
the mob’s Willpower. You may affect a number of mobs per scene equal to
half your power score modifier. On their turn, a mob affected by your
power can make a Charisma saving throw against your power’s passive DC.
On a successful save, the effect ends for that mob.

#### \<h4\> Influence the Masses

**Powers:** Emotion Control and Telepathy

**Cost:** +3 Burnout

**Effect:** You may use your power on mobs, allowing you to implant a
single powerful emotion and target that emotion on all affected. To do
so, perform a single attack roll against the Willpower defense of any
creatures you wish to affect within your area and every adjacent area.
You may affect a number of mobs per scene equal to half your power’s
score modifier.

\</Sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Endurance 

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Constitution

*You are a tireless engine, able to push yourself far beyond the limits
of exhaustion.*

**Effect:** Add your Power Score to your total stamina. Additionally,
you can go a number of days equal to the power score modifier without
any rest or sleep. So long as you are within this period, you
automatically succeed in all checks to resist exhaustion due to lack of
rest or normal exhaustion (like a forced march, you may not be able to
run fast, but you can keep on running long after everyone else has
collapsed). While this power does not make you immune to powers or other
abilities that cause exhaustion or sleep, you add your Power Score
Modifier to your Defenses and saving throws to resist those effects.

### \<h3\>Energy Blast

Damaging, Ranged.

**Primary Ability:** Dexterity

**Action:** Action

**Attack:** by energy type (see energy types and targeted defenses)

**Burnout:** 4

*You generate blasts of energy or hurl a bolt of a particular element.*

**Effect:** Choose an Energy type from the *Energy Types and Targeted
defense* *table* (see pg XX) you may use this power to attack a single
target within range, dealing your chosen energy type in damage.

**Special (Access):** You can take this power multiple times, choosing
different energy types, each of which is tracked as its own power.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Enhanced Attack (same Energy type), Energy Explosion
(same Energy type)

*Power Tricks:* Energy Burst, Rapid Blast

\<sidebar\>

### Power Trick: Energy Burst

**Powers:** Energy Blast, Energy Manipulation

**Cost:** +3 Burnout

**Effect:** A Hero can opt for a burst effect targeting everyone in a
single area rather than a single target. Every person within the burst,
friend, and foe, is affected by the burst as if they were personally
attacked.

### Power Trick: Rapid Blast

**Powers:** Energy Blast

**Cost:** +6 Burnout

**Effect:** You quickly let loose with two blasts, one right after the
other. After attacking with your energy blast, you may make another
attack as a bonus action.

\</sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Energy Explosion

Damaging, Ranged

**Primary Attribute:** Constitution

**Action: Action**

**Attack:** by energy type (see energy types and targeted defenses)

**Burnout:** 3

*You generate an explosion around you, affecting friend and foe alike.*

**Effect:** Choose an Energy type. When you use this power, you attack
everyone in your area and a number of adjoining areas equal to half your
power score modifier. You can take this power multiple times, choosing
different energy types, each being tracked as its own power.

**Power Stunts:**  
*Emulated Powers:* Energy Blast (same Energy type)

### \<h3\>Energy Generation

Damaging, Range (0)

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Action

**Attack:** by energy type (see energy types and targeted defenses)

**Burnout:** 5

*You seem to radiate energy from your own body.*

**Effect:** You project a specific type of energy (chosen from *Energy
Types and Targeted defense* *table* (see pg XX). This power only grants
you the ability to create energy, not shape it, with the power’s score
representing the intensity of its generation. You can take this power
multiple times, choosing different energy types, each being tracked as
its own power.

You may also attempt to use this power to haphazardly attack with this
power with a successful power attack roll, affecting everyone in the
same area, whether friend or foe.

**Special (Synergy):** You may take synergy power modification,
synergizing Energy Generation, and Energy Manipulation if they share the
same energy type.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Absorb Energy (same type), Enhanced Attack, Energy
Blast, Energy Explosion (same type), Energy Manipulation, Energy Sheath,
Environmental Manipulation (same type)

### \<h3\>Energy /Element Manipulation

Scene, Ranged

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Attack:** Avoidance

**Burnout:** 5/2

*You can shape a particular form of energy, allowing you to give it a
semblance of mass.*

**Effect:** Choose an energy type (chosen from *the Energy Types and
Targeted defense table (see pg XX),* or you may choose earth, air, or
water. You can shape that Energy/Element into whatever form you desire.
While simple forms are relatively straightforward, more complex forms
require a Power Check with a DC set, depending on the complexity of the
item you are attempting to create. Objects you create remain till the
end of the scene, after which they fall back into their original
components or harmlessly dissipate.

While simple items (such as a wall) do not require a Power Check, an
item like a cage with a swinging door may require a DC: 10 Power Check.
Something with complex gears like a drawbridge would require a DC: 20
Power Check.

Items created with this power possess hardness equal to your power score
and a number of hits equal to one-third of your Power Score Modifier
(minimum of 1).

If an item made of energy is destroyed, all creatures sharing the same
area with the item suffer this power’s base die in damage as the item
loses all cohesion and explodes.

This power does not produce energy; it only grants you the ability to
shape it. You can take this power multiple times, choosing different
energy types, each being tracked as its own power.

Once an item is created, it lasts until the end of your next turn; you
may choose to refresh this duration, paying 2 burnout at the start of
your turn.

**Special (Light, illuminate):** Someone manipulating light can also use
their power to improve light conditions in an area. Thus, this power
allows you to increase Shadowy light conditions to Bright light,
affecting a number of areas equal to your Power Score Modifier.

**Special (Synergy):** You may take the synergy power modification to
synergize Energy Generation and Energy Manipulation but only if they
share the same energy type.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Absorb Energy\*, Animate Object (allowing you to
animate an object you create through this power), Energy Blast\*, Energy
Explosion\*, Energy Sheath\*, Enhanced Attack\*  
\*same energy type as the parent power.

*Power Tricks:* Energy Burst, Blinding Flash (Energy Manipulation: Light
Only).

\<sidebar\>

### Power Trick: Blinding Flash 

You suddenly hyper-focus the ambient light around you, creating a
blinding flash of light.

**Powers:** Light, Energy Manipulation: Light

**Cost:** +3 Burnout

**Attack:** Fortitude

**Effect:** With a successful attack, you blind all creatures in your
area until the end of your next turn. Once a creature is affected by
this ability you suffer disadvantage of affecting them again, as they
know what you’re capable of and will move to divert their eyes.

Editor’s Note:

Note that although the power trick above is limited to light, there is
no reason why a player cannot develop a similar power trick using a
different energy type, such as comic energy or even fire. Although power
tricks throughout this book are examples of power tricks, you and your
players should feel free to develop new ones.

\</sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Energy Sheath

Scene

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Bonus

**Burnout:** 4

You are surrounded by an energy field that protects you from damage.

**Effect:** You can surround your body with a specific type of energy,
generating intense cold, fire, or light. This power allows you to create
an energy sheath, not manipulate it. You gain DR equal to double your
power score against the energy type you are sheathed in and DR against
Physical and Energy damage equal to half your power score modifier.

Applying enough force to the sheath dissipates around the pressure
point, so you can stand without damaging the floor, grab an object, or
punch a foe while still receiving protection. You receive no bonus for
melee damage while in an energy sheath.

You can take this power multiple times, choosing different energy types,
each of which is tracked as its own power. However, only one Energy
Sheath can be active at a time.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Absorb Energy (same type), Damaging Form, Energy
Blast, Energy Generation, Energy Manipulation, and Enhanced Attack.

### \<h3\>Enhanced Ability Score

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Ability being increased.

*One of your attributes has been… enhanced.*

**Effect:** Select an ability score; increase that ability score by this
power’s score modifier (minimum of +1). You can take this power multiple
times, each time for a different ability score.

**Special (Rank Cap):** if an ability boost provided by this power
pushes an ability score past your rank cap, your ability score is capped
at your rank cap, and any scores beyond that are considered untapped
potential.

### \<h3\>Enhanced Melee Attack 

Continuous, Damaging (special, see below), Melee *or* Weapon

**Primary Ability:** Strength, Dexterity, *or* Wisdom

**Action:** None/Bonus

*Your melee attacks are especially devastating.*

**Effect:** You possess some form of an enhanced melee attack (such as
claws or enveloping your fists in energy, for example) or the ability to
empower a weapon with devastating effectiveness. You can take this power
multiple times, choosing different damage/energy types or weapons, with
each one being tracked as its own power; multiple uses of this power do
not stack with each other.

- *Enhanced Melee Attack:* When choosing this power, you must decide
  whether it can be concealed/turned off and its damage type. If your
  enhanced attack can be concealed /turned off, the power requires a
  bonus action to activate/deactivate it (popping your claws, setting
  your fists on fire, summoning a sword of light, and so on). Your melee
  attacks deal your base power die + your power modifier + your power’s
  primary attribute modifier in damage.

- *Enhanced Melee Weapon Attack:* You may choose to have this power to
  improve the effectiveness of a specific melee weapon instead of
  augmenting your melee attacks. When doing so, choose a melee weapon
  (For example, a Fireman’s Axe, katana, or a baseball bat) and a damage
  type, and if this additional effect can be concealed/turned off it
  requires a bonus action to activate/deactivate it. (For example,
  setting your sword on fire or activating the electrical shock option
  on your escrima sticks) Any time you use that weapon while this effect
  is active, you deal your power score base die in additional damage of
  your chosen type.

### \<h3\>Enhanced Sense

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

*One of your senses is enhanced.*

**Effect:** Choose one of the five senses; when making a perception
check, add your power score modifier while using that sense. You can
take this power multiple times, choosing a different sense each time.

### \<h3\>Entangle

Damaging (special), Interruptible, Range (Passive)

**Primary Ability:** Strength *or* Wisdom

**Action:** Action

**Attack:** Avoidance

**Burnout:** 4

*You can use your powers to envelop and pin an opponent.*

**Effect:** You may grab/grapple an opponent within range utilizing a
power check instead of your *Melee attack* or *Athletics* skill check.
Your target cannot reverse the grapple (See Grappling pg. XX). You may
use this power to *punish* a successfully grappled opponent dealing
Kinetic damage as you squeeze them. You must pay for this power’s
burnout at the beginning of every turn that you maintain this power.

### \<h3\>Flight

**Primary Ability:** Dexterity

**Burnout:** 2

*You can fly.*

**Effect:** During combat, until the end of your next turn, you gain a
fly pace equal to your power score modifier with maneuverability, as
indicated by flying (pg. XX). While in flight, you may reduce your power
score by 2 to increase your maneuverability by one category, from Clumsy
to Agile or Agile to Perfect.

Out of combat, you may fly at a pace equal to your power score, but any
attack against you while flying at this speed is done so with Advantage
as you are focused on your flight.

You must pay the burnout cost of this power at the beginning of every
turn that you use this power to remain aloft.

While flying, you may carry anything your strength can typically carry
up to your max lift.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Power:* Glide

### \<h3\>Force Field

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Burnout:** Action/Reaction

**Burnout:** 5

*You can erect a force field to protect yourself or others.*

**Effect:** As an action or in response to an attack, of which you must
be aware, you can generate a force field that covers a number of areas
up to half your Power Score Modifier (minimum of 1). Each additional
area beyond the first reduces the effective Power Score of the force
field by 2. For example, a force field spanning 4 areas would have its
power score reduced by 8. Creatures cannot pass through an active force
field, and the force field can withstand or hold back a maximum weight
in accordance with its Power Score.

Once a force field is active, it lasts until the end of your next turn;
you can refresh its duration and stamina as a bonus action by paying the
power's burnout cost. The force field has Stamina points equal to your
Power Score. All attacks from outside the force field to those within
damage the forcefield first.

If the force field absorbs Stamina damage greater than your Power Score
or if you suffer a wound, the force field is brought down, ending its
effect. Those within the force field take no damage from the attack that
brought it down. However, you must make a successful Wisdom saving throw
with a DC equal to the damage dealt by that attack or become *shaken*
until the end of your next turn.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Damaging Form, Deflection, Energy Blast (kinetic),
Energy Explosion (kinetic), Enhanced Attack (kinetic), Force Shield.

### \<h3\>Force Field, Personal

Scene

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom *or* Intelligence

**Burnout:** Action

**Burnout:** 5

*You can create a personal, skin-tight force field.*

**Effect:** As an action on your turn, you can generate a personal force
field to protect yourself. The force field grants you temporary stamina
points equal to your power score modifier, which remain until the end of
the scene. If, at any point during the scene, you start a turn with
fewer temporary stamina points than your power score modifier, the force
field regenerates back to its original value, up to a maximum number of
temporary stamina points equal to your power score modifier. If your
personal force field absorbs a total amount of damage equal to your
power score in one turn, it is brought down, ending its effect. Note
that the force field only protects you and not anyone else.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Deflection, Elemental/Energy Blast (kinetic),
Enhanced Attack (kinetic), Force Shield, Life-Support.

### \<h3\>Force Shield

Scene

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Bonus

**Burnout:** 2

*You can create a shield of pure force.*

**Effect:** You can create a shield of pure force. This shield works
like a normal shield (see shields under Equipment, pg. XX), except it
provides a bonus to your Avoidance equal to half your power score
modifier (minimum +1) and need not be held. Being a shield of pure
force, it is far harder to break than a normal shield, possessing
material strength equal to your power score and a number of hits equal
to your power score modifier.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Deflection, Enhanced Attack (kinetic), Force Field.

### \<h3\>Free Consciousness 

Scene

**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom

**Action:** Demanding

**Burnout:** 8

*You possess the ability to separate your consciousness from your
physical body, entering an intangible, incorporeal state known as astral
projection.*

**Effect:** By succeeding in a Power Check, the difficulty of which
depends on your surroundings (DC 10 for peaceful meditation, DC 20
during battle, and DC 30 when under attack), your consciousness is freed
from your body. While in this state, your body remains in its current
position, rendering it helpless. It continues to perform basic bodily
functions but cannot eat or drink, though alternative methods like
intravenous nourishment are possible.

Your freed consciousness retains your mental ability scores, skills, and
defenses but lacks physical ability scores, stamina, and wounds. It
exists on a separate plane of existence and is undetectable and
invulnerable to physical attacks by normal means.

Navigating as a freed consciousness can be challenging. You can
instantly travel to any location within your standard line of sight
within a number of Areas equal to the power score modifier, up to a
maximum range equal to your power score in areas. Traveling beyond that
range requires power checks, with a DC of 15 to move at your normal pace
and a DC of 20 to pass through physical barriers like walls.

Alternatively, you can instantly teleport to a familiar location with a
successful power check.

The difficulty of this task depends on the level of familiarity and
emotional attachment: DC 15 for very familiar places, DC 20 for familiar
but emotionally neutral places, and DC 30 for locations you have only
seen once. Merely seeing an image or likeness of a location is
insufficient; you must have physically been there to travel using this
method. At the Editor-in-Chief's discretion, during highly dramatic
moments, you may be able to rush to someone dear to you, even without
knowing their location or prior visit. However, this would typically
require a Plot Point. It's important to note that many magical or
powered barriers may be impassable even to a freed consciousness.  
  
If your freed consciousness is physically damaged, it instantly returns
to your body. In such cases, you must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw
to avoid suffering a wound from the traumatic reconnection (beware of
Threats with the Third Eye Feat and Spirit Seeker Power Modification).

Returning to your physical body voluntarily is an action that does not
require a roll. While in your freed consciousness state, you can observe
the physical world without interacting with it or using your powers,
except through the Poltergeist trick.

**Power Stunts:**

*Power Tricks:* Manifestation, Poltergeist

### \<h3\>Geospatial Shift 

Interruptible

**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom

**Action:** Demanding

**Burnout:** 10

*You can vanish from one location and appear miles away in another.*

**Effect:** Similar to Teleport, this power allows you to transport
yourself and anything or anyone you can carry a number of miles equal to
your power score with just a thought, appearing in an unoccupied space.
However, the minimum distance you can travel using this power is one
mile. As with Teleport, your mode of transportation may involve you
passing through other dimensions, briefly stopping time, or moving at
quantum speeds.

| Power Score | Distance                   |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| 10-20       | power score in miles       |
| 21-29       | power score x 10 in miles  |
| 30-39       | Power score x 100 in miles |
| 40+         | Anywhere on earth          |

**Power Tricks**

*Emulated Powers:* Teleport, Portal

*Power Trick:* Alonge for the ride

\<side bar\>

#### \<h4\>Power Trick: Along for the ride 

You can bring others with you when you teleport

**Cost:** +2 Burnout

**Effect:** When you teleport, you can bring a number of passengers
equal to half your power score modifier.

\</side bar\>

### \<h3\>Glide 

**Primary Attribute:** Dexterity

**Burnout:** 1

*You possess the incredible ability to glide through the air, giving you
an advantage in aerial combat and mobility.*

**Effect:** In combat, you gain the ability to glide through the air
with a fly pace equal to half your power score modifier; out of combat,
you can glide your full power score modifier. Regardless, you cannot
gain altitude while gliding; you lose 1 area of height per turn.

You can control your descent rate and direction while gliding, allowing
you to maneuver through tight spaces or land safely from great heights
as if you possessed agile maneuverability (see Fly pg. XX). You must pay
the burnout cost of this power every turn that you use this power to
remain aloft. If you fail to pay the Burnout cost at the beginning of a
turn, you fall from your current position.

**Note:** This power is different from the Flight power in that it does
not grant the ability to gain altitude or hover in place, but it
provides greater control over descent rate and direction while gliding.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Flight

*Power Tricks:* Thermal Updraft

\<Sidebar\>

### Power Trick: Thermal Updraft

**Powers:** Glide

**Cost:** +1 Burnout

**Effect:** By paying an additional point of Burnout, you can use your
gliding ability to catch and ride thermal updrafts, gaining 1 area of
altitude and remaining aloft for longer periods of time.

\</Sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Gravity Control 

Ranged (Passive), Scene

**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom

**Action:** Demanding

**Attack:** Fortitude

**Burnout:** 5

*You can alter the pull of gravity. You can root objects and people in
place or cause them to float away.*

**Effect:** This power has two aspects: increasing and decreasing
gravity's pull on a target.

**Increase Gravity:** By successfully hitting a target with a power
attack roll, you can amplify the pull of gravity. You genially apply
this effect, dealing no damage, or you can violently apply the full pull
of gravity upon a target, dealing your powers base die in kinetic
damage. Regardless of how you apply this effect, the target's weight
increases by an amount equal to the Max Lift value for the power's
score. If this added weight is below the target's maximum lift, they
have their pace reduced by half until the end of your next turn. If the
weight reaches twice their Max Lift, they also suffer Disadvantage on
melee attacks. If the weight reaches four times their Max Lift, they
become immobile. This power can make an object too heavy to move or
lift.

**Decrease Gravity:** You can reduce a target's weight by an amount
equal to the Max Lift value of the power's rank. Anyone attempting to
lift the target applies their Strength against the new weight. If the
weight is reduced to zero, the target becomes easily movable. Note that
massive, weightless objects can still pose a danger. If an object is
pushed out of your power’s range, it breaks free of this power but may
have to deal with a sudden drop to the ground.

***Power Stunts:***

*Emulated Powers:* Flight, Glide, Move Object

### \<h3\>Growth

Scene

**Primary Ability:** Constitution

**Action:** Demanding

**Burnout:** 5

*You can increase your overall size.*

**Effect:** You can increase your overall size by a number of sizes
depending upon your power score (see table below), up to a maximum of
gargantuan. Each increase in size costs 5 burnout points. For each size
increase, your mass doubles, your Strength score increases by 2, and
your Avoidance Defense is reduced by 1. You may end the effect of this
power as a bonus action.

For example, if your power score modifier is 25, you could increase your
size by up to 3 categories, from Medium to Large to Huge to Gargantuan,
paying 15 burnout points (5 for each size increase). You would gain a +8
bonus to your Strength score and suffer a -3 to your avoidance defense.

See Creature Sizes pg. XX for additional effects like reach of melee
attacks.

### \<h3\>Heal

Interruptible **  
Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Action/Special

**Burnout:** 8

*You can heal others with but a touch.*

**Effect:** With a simple touch, you can restore a creature's stamina.
Roll your power base die and add your Primary Ability Score bonus, you
heal that in stamina.

Alternatively, you can use this ability to heal a Wound. This requires 1
minute and a DC 30 Power Check. You regain the ability to do so after
completing a short rest.

***Power Stunts:***

*Power Tricks:* heal the psyche, healing burst.

\<sidebar\>

#### \<h4\>Power Trick: healing burst 

You release a burst of healing energy, healing your allies.

**Powers:** Heal

**Action:** Action

**Cost:** +4 Burnout

**Effect:** you heal a number of friendly creatures within your area and
adjacent areas equal to half your power rank modifier. You heal a total
number of stamina points equal to double your power score, which must be
distributed among those you heal.

If your editor-in-chief utilizes the optional psychosis and madness
rules in chapter XX, this power tick becomes available.

### \<h4\>Power Trick: Heal the psyche.

You can heal trauma suffered by others.

**Powers:** Heal, Telepathy

**Action:** 1 hour

**Cost:** +3 Burnout

**Effect:** This power stunt removes 1 level of psychosis. An individual
can only benefit from this power once during a long rest.

\</sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Imbue Consciousness 

Interruptible, Melee, Scene

**Primary Attribute:** Charisma

**Action: Demanding**

**Burnout:** 8

*You can grant an object sentience for a limited time.*

**Effect:** You imbue an object with limited sentience and
consciousness. You gain a number of points equal to the Power Score
Modifier plus the Charisma Modifier to split among its three Mental
ability scores and skills as you see fit. You may also split these
points among multiple objects if you wish. An object you imbue may only
have skills that you possess. You may further enhance an object’s
abilities by temporarily draining your own ability scores on a
one-to-one basis, but only for the same ability score.

For instance, if you wish to increase an object’s Intelligence by two
points, you will have to reduce your Intelligence by two points. These
points cannot be recovered as long as the object retains consciousness.
After this power ends, lost ability points return at the rate of 1 point
per ability per scene. If you do not assign at least 1 point to
Intelligence, the object cannot think for itself and will only obey
basic commands. If you do not assign at least 1 point to Charisma, the
object will be unable to respond or express itself. If you do not assign
at least 1 point to Wisdom, the object will be unaware of the world
around it.

This power does not grant the object any new ability to hear, see,
sense, speak, interact, or move. You would need to Animate the object
using the Animate Object power. This power only works on non-living,
non-sentient objects.

**Note:** Zombies and other undead are considered living for the
purposes of this power.

**Special (Synergy):** If you possess both Animate Object and Imbue
Consciousness, you may take the synergy power modification with both
powers combining them.

**Special (Combining Effects):** You can combine this power with Animate
Object and Imbue Consciousness using both powers simultaneously for 10
burnout.

### \<h3\>Incorporeal

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Bonus Action

**Burnout:** 8/2

*You can move through solid matter.*

**Effect:** You can become incorporeal and move through solid matter.
You don’t completely phase out of existence; rather, your molecules
spread apart enough to allow you to bypass other molecules. When you use
this power, you make your clothes and personal belongings incorporeal
with you and any other object or person you are touching up to a total
weight of half your power score’s maximum lift. When you let go of an
item (or person), it immediately becomes corporeal. You cannot touch or
manipulate items that didn’t become incorporeal with you. To remain
Incorporeal, you must pay 2 burnout at the beginning of every turn; your
power score modifier determines the maximum number of turns you remain
Incorporeal (minimum of 1). Additionally, you can fly at your pace with
perfect maneuverability while incorporeal.

While you can pass through creatures freely, your power score must be
equal to or greater than the material strength of the object for you to
pass through it (see Survival, breaking Objects pg. XX). When passing
through solid objects, you must reduce your pace by half or suffer
damage equal to half that object’s material strength in stamina damage.
You may attempt to pass through harder objects with a successful Power
Check, with the DC being equal to the difference between your power
score and the material strength of the object.

Normally, you cannot move through active energy fields, no matter how
faint. You can attempt to move through an active energy field with a
successful Power Check against a DC equal to double the power score of
the field itself.

When something or someone becomes corporal within an object or an object
within them, they suffer stamina damage equal to the material strength
of the object they became corporal within (which may result in a wound)
as they are instantly ejected from the object or the object from them
into the nearest empty space.

When any force is applied inside your body, such as a swung baseball bat
or punch, the attack sweeps away some of your molecules; as such, you
suffer half the damage from such physical damage but still suffer full
energy damage.

For instance, if you possessed Incorporeal: 25, you can remain
incorporeal for 7 turns and pass through Steel Alloys (MS: 25) but would
be required to make a DC: 15 Power Check to pass through Titanium (MS:
30) and a DC: 15 Power Check to pass though DH3 Palladium Metallic Glass
(MS: 40)

**Special (Invisibility):** when incorporeal, you are considered to
possess invisibility power (touch) equal to your power score.

\<Story\>

In the early days after Z-Day, many incorporeal Heroes made the mistake
of thinking they were invulnerable to the zombie plague. They were
wrong.

\</story\>

### \<h3\>**Inventive Gadgetry**

**Primary Ability:** Intelligence

**Action:** Special (See below)

**Burnout:** As per power chosen.

*You possess the remarkable ability to create functional gadgets out of
what others would consider junk.*

**Effect:** There are three ways to use your power to create a gadget.

- *Taking my time:* In those rare times that you have an extended time
  to create a gadget, you may spend 8 hours creating a gadget with the
  removable power flaw. Items made in this manner can be maintained
  indefinitely with regular maintenance. You must spend 4 hours per day
  maintaining the gadget. Not doing so will cause the gadget to stop
  working 24 hours after it was created or maintained.

- *Give me time to think:* If you create a gadget over the course of 4
  uninterrupted hours, it can be used 3 times, after which it burns out
  and becomes worthless.

- *Just give me a minute:* If you have the right materials, you can
  create a gadget on the fly. By spending a plot die and taking 1
  minute, you may create a gadget that works for only 1 use, after which
  the gadget burns out, becoming worthless.

**Materials:** What you can build and how dependable it is depends upon
the quality of the materials you have at hand. The editor-in-chief
determines the quality of materials you have to work with at the moment
you’re making your gadget.

- *Inadequate materials:* When working with inadequate materials, you
  can still put something together but have no idea how it works. Your
  gadget possesses an unreliable power flaw (you gain no benefit from
  this flaw), and its power score is reduced by 2 and cannot be
  maintained.

- *Barely Adequate Materials:* This is the baseline after Z-Day unless
  you have been gathering materials and have a safe and secure place to
  store it all. Items created with such limited resources have their
  power score reduced by 2

- *This is perfect!* In the rare cases where you have just the right
  parts for the gadget you are working on, you might just make something
  that won’t fall apart. If the gadget you created has limited uses, its
  power score is increased by 2. If you took 8 hours to make your gadget
  and maintained it for 10 days, you may make it a permanent item (see
  emulated powers below) as if you had mastered a new power stunt.

- *Reusing Materials:* Depending on the gadget's power and how it was
  used, you may or may not be able to recover materials to make future
  gadgets; the editor-in-chief has the discretion to do so.

**Gadgets:** Gadgets are commonly handheld but may be larger depending
upon the item's intended use, which is determined by the
editor-in-chief. Gadgets copy any one power at a power rank equal to
your power score; all gadgets have the removable item power modification
and the external power source or a limited number of uses depending upon
the method used to create the item (but gain no bonuses to their power
score for having these power modifications) when crafting the gadget you
may be able to apply a power modification, discuss this with your
editor-in-chief who is the final arbiter if the power modification is
appropriate.

If you have a gadget created using this power, it is destroyed when you
use this power to create a new gadget. You can have multiple instances
of this power, allowing you to create and possess a gadget for each
instance of this power.

If someone else attempts to use a gadget you created without being shown
how it works (requiring short rest) they suffer Disadvantage on any
attack roll, power check, or skill check required while using the item.

**Special (Power Modifications):** With the exception of the All-Skills
power modification, you cannot apply any power modifications to this
power.

**Special (Inventive Gadgetry: Create Magical Items):** More mystic
heroes can take Inventive Gadgetry to represent the creation of magical
items such as staffs, totems, fetishes, and scrolls, in which cases the
items required may be rarer than those required by its more
technological adaptation. Additionally, items created through the
*Taking My Time* option do not have the external power source power
modification. Instead, they tap into your arcane power; as such, you pay
the burnout cost when activating the item's power.

**Power Stunts:**

*Permanent Gadget:* Once you have maintained an item for 10 days, you
may take the master emulated power feat to make it a permanent gadget
that works like an *emulated power.* These gadgets possess external
power source, and removable item power modifications are treated as
individual items and are not destroyed when you create a gadget with
this power. You may destroy a permanent gadget when creating a new one
if you need the suitable materials. If a permanent gadget is lost or
destroyed, it can be replaced by building a new one between issues.

### \<h3\>Invisibility

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Bonus Action/Reaction

**Burnout:** Sight: 4 / All Others: 2

*You can fool one of the senses.*

**Effect:** This power allows you to become *undetectable* to a
particular sense, most commonly sight. Once activated, you become
*undetectable* to that sense and must pay the burnout cost of this power
at the beginning of every turn in which this power remains active.

While *undetectable*, anyone attempting to detect you with the sense you
are undetectable must make a perception (wisdom) check against your
power’s passive DC or a Power Check if they possess an appropriate
sensory power. Additionally, if someone possesses a sensory power with a
power score 10 points higher than your invisibility power score, they
automatically detect you if you are both in the same area. Additionally,
the Editor-in-Chief may require you to roll a Power Check when
attempting to remain undetected under extraordinary conditions
(reimaging invisible to sight in the falling snow).

If successfully detected, the creature that detected you knows your
exact location if both of you are in the same area or what area you’re
in if you are not.

This power may be activated in response to being detected as a reaction,
in this case, you must pay double the burnout cost and suffer a -5
penalty to any Power Checks to remain undetected until the start of your
turn.

When you choose this power, you must select one of the following, with
each sense/detection method being tracked as its own power.

- Sight

- Smell

- Hearing

- Mental Detection

- Technology

If you possess more than one kind of invisibility, they may be activated
and maintained as if they were a single power for no additional burnout
cost. You must choose the Incorporeal power to be “invisible” against
touch.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Chameleon (same type)

### \<h3\>Invulnerability 

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Constitution

*You are invulnerable to a type of damage or condition*

**Effect:** When you acquire this power, choose a specific type of
energy, mental attack, or condition.

- ***Invulnerability: Damage Category:*** You gain DR equal to your
  power score modifier against that specific damage category.

- ***Invulnerability: Damage type:*** You gain DR equal to 6+, your
  power score modifier against that specific damage type.

- ***Invulnerability: Mental attacks:*** You gain DR equal to 6+, your
  power score modifier, against attacks that deal psychic damage, such
  as Psychic Attack Power. When resisting the effects of powers such as
  Mind Control, you gain a bonus to your defenses and saving throws
  equal to half your power score modifier (minimum of +1). You may
  “drop” your resistance against mental powers to allow someone to
  affect you, such as allowing an ally to establish telepathic
  communication.

- ***Invulnerability: Condition:*** You gain a bonus to your defenses or
  saving throws to resist the application of a chosen condition equal to
  half your power score modifier (minimum of +1).

You can take this power multiple times, choosing different energy types,
each of which is tracked as its own power.

### \<h3\>Life Support 

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

*Your powers keep you safe from most environmental threats.*

**Effect:** In its base form, Life-Support protects you from
increasingly deadly environmental conditions as you increase your power
score. This power allows you to operate in hostile environmental
conditions for some time; you can persist beyond this limitation with a
successful DC: 30 Power Check; once you reach a power score of 40, you
may survive in hostile environments indefinitely without the need for
air, food, or water.

| Score | Environmental Conditions |
|----|----|
| 10-13 | Immune to common environmental conditions such as cold or heat. |
| 14-17 | Can breathe underwater |
| 18-21 | High Pressure/Low Pressure - effects of water pressure and the bends operate perfectly at high altitudes. |
| 22-25 | Not affected by gases |
| 26-29 | Immune to poisons and toxins |
| 30-35 | Immune to high radiation levels |
| 36 | Can exist in the vacuum of space, or the pressure and cold of the deepest sea trenches. |

Although you may not be immune to a condition until you reach a
particular score, if you are exposed to a harmful environment, you may,
at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, attempt a Power Check against a DC
equal to the maximum power score required to survive in that
environment, if successful your power protects you for a number of turns
equal to your power score modifier.

Alternatively, you can limit this power to underwater environments when
selecting it. Your starting power score is increased by 10 points, but
your power only operates when you are submerged underwater.

### \<h3\>Luck

**Primary Ability:** Charisma

**Burnout:** 6

*You were just born lucky.*

**Effect:** You have a pool of luck points equal to your power score
modifier. You can use these points to modify your die rolls. By spending
a luck point and paying 6 burnout, you gain Advantage on your next
attack roll, skill check, power check, ability check, or saving throw.
Alternately, when you are attacked, you may spend a luck point and pay 6
burnout to grant your attacker Disadvantage on their attack roll against
you. Finally, you may spend 5 luck points, allowing you to gain the
effects of a plot point, granting you the ability to alter a scene. You
regain all expended luck points after completing a long rest.

**Special, Luck is a…:** If you roll two 1s on any roll, or your
attacker rolls two 20s on an attack roll, this power temporarily stops
working until you complete a long rest.

**Special story impact:** Heroes with this power find themselves in the
embrace of fickle fate. While not quite a flaw, you and the
Editor-in-Chief are encouraged to emphasize this aspect. Things either
go incredibly well for you or become one of "those" days. This theme
doesn't affect the power itself but should be a consistent element of
your experience.

### \<h3\>Manifest Gear

Scene

**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence

**Action:** Bonus

**Burnout:** 4

*You always seem to have just the gadget you need. Maybe you create a
biological version of the gadget, maybe you have Nano-bots injected into
your skin that allow you to create temporary items on the fly, or maybe
you just have a very handy utility belt you keep well stocked.*

**Effect:** You begin every Issue with a number of temporary acquisition
points equal to this power score modifier (minimum of 1). As a bonus
action you may manifest a single piece of equipment, spending that
equipment’s AP cost in temporary acquisition points. These points do not
transfer between issues. The equipment manifested is single use only; if
it is not used, it becomes useless at the end of the scene. Weapons with
ammo are manifested with a single round of ammo ready to fire. Batteries
are manifested with enough charge for a single use.

**Special (Unique Power Modification Limitation: All-Skill):** If this
is an All-Skill power, then any equipment manifested must be small
enough to be carried on the Hero’s person reasonably.

### \<h3\>Mimic

Scene

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 8/2

*You can mimic another’s powers.*

**Effect:** Choose an origin (for example, Super-Human or Mystical. See
pg. XX); you may duplicate the power of someone utilizing that origin as
long as you are within a number of areas equal to double your power
score modifier.

You may only mimic a single power at a time; these powers are acquired
at either the power score of the power possessed by your target or your
power score in the Mimic power, whichever is lower. You don’t gain any
of the power’s flaws, perks, or developed Power Stunts. On your turn, as
a bonus action, you may stop mimicking a power to learn to mimic a new
power.

The first burnout cost (8) is applied the first time you mimic a new
power from a new source; the second burnout cost (2) is paid any time
you mimic a power you previously mimicked as long as it’s from a source
you have already mimicked.

**Special (Multiple Origins and Activation):** You may take this power
more than once, allowing you to mimic an additional power at a time,
with each instance considered an independent power. For every 2
instances of this power, you can copy powers from an additional Origin.
For instance, if you have Mimic 16 and Mimic 12, you can mimic powers
from two Origins of your choice. If you possess 4 instances of this
power, you can mimic the powers from 3 different origins.

Also, if you possess multiple copies of this power, they can all be
activated simultaneously as if they were a single power for no
additional burnout cost.

**For example**, KopyKat, who possesses Mimic: 28, sees Velocity use his
Burst power for the first time. On his next action, he pays 8 burnout
and acquires Burst as one of the powers, but at Velocity’s power score
of 20. Later that day, KopyKat can recall that power for 2 burnout,
which he retains for the remainder of the scene or until he recalls a
different power.

### \<h3\>Mind Control

Interruptible, Melee, Range (Passive)

**Primary Ability:** Charisma *or* Intelligence

**Action:** Demanding

**Attack:** Willpower

**Burnout:** 4

*A favorite of supervillains, you can force others to do your bidding.*

**Effect:** With a successful attack, you gain complete control over
your intended target, which now responds to your commands for the
remainder of the scene.

At the end of their turn, a controlled target may attempt to break your
hold over their mind with a successful wisdom saving throw against this
power passive DC. The Editor-in-Chief may add circumstance modifiers
from +1 to +6 based on whether the commands align with or against the
target’s nature. Creatures who break free of mental control know they
were controlled and may know who was controlling them depending upon how
they were controlled.

You may attempt to control several targets simultaneously, up to a
maximum number of targets equal to half your power score modifier, but
must pay burnout for each creature affected. If two or more people are
under your thrall, you can simultaneously issue the same command to
both.

**Note:** Zombies are completely immune to Mind Control.

**Power Stunts**:

*Power Tricks:* Influence the Masses, Summon Animal, Modify Memory

\<Side Bar\>

#### Mental Powers

Mental powers (such as Mind Control, Emotion Control, and Telepathy)
only work against sentient creatures, which may include highly advanced
androids. However, such beings commonly possess Resistance (mental).

Mental powers do not work on Zombies or non-sentient robots.

\<Side Bar\>

### \<h3\>Move Object

Range (Passive)

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom *or* Charisma

**Action:** Complex

**Attack:** Avoidance

**Burnout:** 3

*You can move objects at a distance with your force of will. Whether
through telekinesis or the manipulation of magnetic forces, the results
are the same.*

**Effect:** Until the end of your next turn, you can manipulate objects
or creatures within range, causing them to move at a speed equal to half
your power score modifier and with a strength equal to your power score.
You can handle multiple objects simultaneously by dividing your power
score among them. For instance, if you have Move Object 22, you can move
two objects as long as you can lift them with Move Object 11 (allowing
you to manipulate two objects weighing up to 200 lbs. each).

Once you reach a power score of 20, you gain the ability for fine
manipulation. You can use Move Object to perform physical tasks at a
distance, though you do so with a disadvantage.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Flight, Personal Force Field, Force Shield, Energy
Blast (Kinetic), Entangle.

### \<h3\>Multiple Limbs 

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Strength or Dexterity

*You have more than the normal number of limbs.*

**Effect:** This power gives you an additional limb or strengthens an
existing additional limb, depending on your power score. This can be a
tail, a pair of wings, one — or more — arms, multiple legs, or any
combination thereof.

You can grow/manifest a number of extra limbs equal to your power score
divided by 10 (Minimum of 1), with these extra limbs possessing a total
strength equal to your power score, which must be spread among them.
This is someone with multiple limbs: 20 could grow two arms with a
strength of 10 each.

*Multiple Arms/Tentacles* allow you to use multiple two-handed weapons,
a two-handed weapon, a shield, and so on; you also gain your power score
modifier to Athletics checks and your Strength score to lift/drag
objects. Lastly, you gain Advantage on all grapple attempts.

*Multiple Legs* increase your pace by 1 per limb. Additionally, you gain
your power score modifier to resist knockback.

*Tail* grants you your power score modifier to Athletics checks to keep
your balance. Additionally, your tail can be prehensile, allowing you to
hold objects with it or even hang from it if the limb is strong enough
to hold your weight.

**Special (Special Power Modification)**

*Limitation (+4):* You can limit yourself to one of the 4 options above;
if you do so, your power score is increased by +4

**Power Stunts**  
*Emulated Power:* Enhanced attack (growing claws), Fly (growing wings)

### \<h3\>Nullify

Interruptible, Range (Passive), Scene

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom *or* Charisma

**Action:** Action

**Attack:** Discipline

**Burnout:** 8/2

*You can prevent others from using their powers.*

**Effect:** Choose an origin (for example, Super-Human or Mystical. See
pg. XX); you possess the ability to shut off *one* of your target’s
powers, which utilizes that power source with a successful attack
against your target’s Discipline; you can choose a specific power you
have seen your target use, or know they have, or nullify a random power.
Your target must be within a number of areas equal to one-half your
power score modifier (minimum of 1); if your target moves out of your
range, it instantly regains the use of its power. If they reenter your
range during the same scene, you can once again nullify the same power
for only 2 Burnout without the need for an attack roll.

***Power Stunt:***

*Power Trick:* Learn how to nullify the powers of another origin,
Nullify Multiple Powers.

### \<h3\>Portal

Range

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Demanding

**Burnout:** 8

*You possess the ability to create and manipulate portals, allowing you
to travel instantaneously between two points in space.*

**Effect:** As demanding action, you can create a pair of connected
portals. One of these portals can be opened anywhere within line of
sight and within a number of areas equal to your power score modifier.
The other needs to be within line of sight or a location you have been
to up to a maximum number of miles equal to your power score modifier.

Once the portals are created, you or any creature can use one portal to
step through and emerge from the other portal, instantly transporting it
to the corresponding location. Each portal remains active for a scene or
until you dismiss them as a free action.

Creatures and objects caught between portals when they close are ejected
at one end of the portal or the other, depending on which side they were
mostly on.

Portals can only be created in an unoccupied space within an area. These
portals are generally the size of a medium-sized creature, but you may
create larger portals depending on your power score.

\<side bar\>

Portals and Combat: The use of portals in combat requires precision and
timing. A character attempting to attack or reach through a portal
suffers a -4 penalty to their attack or contest roll due to the
distorted perspective and unpredictable spatial interaction. Larger
objects or creatures might not fit through smaller portals at the
Editor-In-Chief’s discretion.

\</side bar\>

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Teleportation, Geospatial Shift, Deflection (use a
portal to deflect damage)

### \<h3\>Poison

Continuous, Melee *or* Range (0)

**Primary Ability:** Constitution

**Action:** Special, See below

**Attack:** Special, Fortitude

*You possess a poisonous attack.*

**Effect:** When this power is first chosen, you must choose the way you
deliver the poison into the target’s system.

- ***Poison Spit:*** You can attempt to spit poison on a creature in
  your area with a successful ranged attack against the target’s
  avoidance with a penalty assigned by the editor-in-chief; if you
  successfully hit, you must then make a power attack against your
  target’s fortitude, if successful you deal your power base die in
  poison damage and your target is poisoned for a number of turns equal
  to your power score modifier, at the end of their turn an affected
  creature can make a new Constitution saving throw to end the
  condition. Your penalty against the target’s Avoidance can range from
  -2 for someone mostly covered by clothing to a disadvantage for
  someone dressed in armor. If a target has no exposed skin (someone in
  power armor with the life-support power, for example), you will find
  it almost impossible to use this power. If you choose this option,
  your power score is increased by +4

- ***Poison Touch:*** You must succeed in a melee attack to touch your
  target's exposed skin; it is sometimes harder than it seems. First,
  make an unarmed melee attack against the target’s Avoidance with a
  penalty assigned by the editor-in-chief; if you successfully hit, you
  must then make a power attack against your target’s fortitude, if
  successful you deal your power base die in poison damage, and your
  target is poisoned for a number of turns equal to your power score
  modifier, at the end of their turn an affected creature can make a new
  Constitution saving throw to end the condition. Your penalty against
  the target Avoidance can range from -2 for someone mostly covered by
  clothing to a disadvantage for someone dressed in armor. If a target
  has no exposed skin (someone in power armor with life-support power,
  for example), you will find it almost impossible to use this power. If
  you choose this option, your power score is increased by +4

- ***Poisonous Attack:*** This option must be attached to an Enhanced
  Melee Attack power (see the power above). Any time you attack someone
  with your enhanced attack and successfully deal more damage than the
  target’s DR against that attack, roll a Power Check against the
  target’s fortitude. If successful, your target is poisoned for a
  number of turns equal to your power score modifier; at the end of
  their turn, an affected creature can make a Constitution saving throw
  against your passive power DC to end the condition.

- ***Area Attack:*** The Hero possesses poisonous pheromones, which they
  can release as an action affecting everyone within the same area. This
  requires a power attack against the fortitude defense of everyone in
  the area, whether friend or foe. Creatures you hit suffer your power
  base, die in poison damage, and are poisoned for a number of turns
  equal to your power score modifier; at the end of their turn, an
  affected creature can make a Constitution saving throw against your
  passive power DC to end the condition. Although this is a very
  efficient delivery method, the poison is not as concentrated. If you
  choose this option, your power score is reduced by 2

Multiple applications do not deal additional damage; instead, they reset
the number of turns the poison remains in the target’s system. It also
makes the poison harder to resist, with each successful new application
of the poison giving the target a -1 cumulative penalty to their Mettle
(Constitution) to end the poisoned condition.

**Special (Resistance - Poison):** you are immune to your poison and are
considered to possess Resistance: Poison 10 or at a power score equal to
half your score in this power, whichever is greater.

**Special (Alternate Non-Damaging Effect):** Alternately, you can have
the poison not deal damage or grant the poisoned condition but instead
deal a Secondary Effect (See Power Modifications below) at no score
penalty.

**Special (Synergy):** You may take the synergy power modification
synergizing Poison and Weaken.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Weaken (via the same method as poison)

**\<Side bar\>**

### Using Poison in the Game

The poison power can be used for all types of poison; for example, a
poisonous spider may have Poison 12.

**\</Side bar\>**

### \<h3\>Possession

Melee, Scene, Ranged

**Primary Attribute:** Charisma or Intelligence

**Action:** Action

**Attack:** Discipline

**Burnout:** 8

You can displace your consciousness into the minds of others, taking
control of their bodies. This power allows you to project your mental
abilities and skills onto the target while retaining their physical
abilities. However, the Editor-in-Chief has the final say on which
powers are retained based on their intuitive nature. It's important to
note that possession leaves your true body defenseless against other
possession attempts.

Upon a successful attack, your consciousness merges with the target's,
replacing their Mental ability scores and Skills with your own. You
retain any inherent powers that can be used intuitively but may lose
those that rely on training or skill. You retain limited control over
your true body; you retain the ability to defend yourself, eat and
drink, and move at your normal pace, but you cannot take further
actions.

Once per scene, the creature you possess may attempt to expel you from
their mind by succeeding on Charisma or Intelligence saving throw. The
editor-in-chief may apply circumstance modifiers based on your actions
and align them with the target's nature. Only one being can possess a
target at a time, and if someone else successfully uses Possession, the
first possessor is forced back into their own body.

**Special (Incorporeal):** If this power is used while utilizing Free
Consciousness, Incorporeal, Projection, or a similar power, your
intangible form physically inhabits the creature you possess.

**Special (Long-Term Possession):** Possession can continue from scene
to scene if the Burnout cost is paid. The creature you possess can
attempt to expel you from their mind once per scene with a successful
Charisma or Intelligence saving throw. If a target remains possessed for
24 hours, they can only attempt their saving throw once daily. If
possessed for a full month, they can only make a saving throw at the
beginning of each Issue to attempt expulsion. At the Editor-in-Chief's
discretion, if a Bystander remains possessed for over a month, it can be
considered a permanent possession unless voluntarily vacated or forced
out by others. You can return to your original body, at will, for a
total number of days equal to your power score modifier (minimum of 1).
If you do not return to your body after a number of days equal to your
power score, your consciousness severs its connection with your body,
resulting in its death. The fate of a consciousness forced out without a
living body is beyond the scope of this book.

**Special (Non-Humans):** Possession is not limited to targeting
sentient beings. It can affect non-sentient animals with a brain,
artificial intelligences, and the undead. However, non-animate corpses
and non-sentient machinery are unaffected. It's worth noting that
zombies are not immune to possession but require another attack roll
every turn to maintain control. If a zombie remains possessed for a
number of turns equal to or exceeding the possessor's Discipline, the
insatiable hunger for flesh overwhelms them. At the Editor-in-Chief's
discretion, those who possess a zombie long enough to experience this
hunger may develop psychosis, temporary personality flaws, or even
long-term madness to reflect mental derangement. Possessed zombies do
not follow the rules for Long-Term Possession and cannot be possessed
permanently. The nature of the Z-Virus only allows a zombie's
consciousness to remain outside its body for a number of days equal to
its power score modifier.

### \<H3\>Power Boost 

Scene

**Primary Ability:** Charisma

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 8

*You can temporarily boost someone else’s powers.*

**Effect:** Select an origin other than "highly trained." You can boost
a single power of an individual from that origin by increasing their
power score by your power score modifier until the end of the scene.
Power boosts from different individuals do not accumulate; only the
highest bonus applies. However, two individuals can each boost different
powers possessed by the same individual.

***Power Stunt:***

*Power Trick:* learn how to boost the powers of another origin.

### \<h3\>Precognition

Interruptible

**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom

**Action:** Demanding

**Burnout:** 15

*You possess the ability to see glimpses of the future. However, the
question remains: are these visions certain outcomes or merely
possibilities?*

**Effect:** When using this power to see future events, make a Power
check against a DC set by how far into the future you are attempting to
see. Looking 24 hours ahead requires a DC 15 Power Check, a month ahead
of DC 25, a year ahead of DC 30, and a decade or more ahead of DC 40+ or
higher.

It's important to note that anything you see is predominantly a
potential future, subject to the influence of fate, dice rolls, the
actions of heroes, and the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief. The
Editor-in-Chief may present possible futures that you may want to
prevent or reveal the fate of bystanders. The context of what you see is
often unclear. For instance, seeing someone "dead" doesn't necessarily
mean they are truly deceased. They could be asleep, faking their death,
only injured, a body double, or involved in some other deceptive
circumstance.

**Special (Unique Power Modifications):**

*- Reflective Precognition (-2):* Your subconscious taps into your
precognitive abilities, granting a bonus to your initiative roll equal
to your power score modifier (minimum of +1) when you spend 8 Burnout
before the initiative is rolled.

*- Retrocognition (+0):* Instead of peering into the future, you can use
this power to witness past events. In this case, the power works in
reverse, requiring a successful DC 10 Power Check to see something that
occurred within the past 24 hours, with higher DCs for events further
back in time. As with Precognition, the visions lack context. However,
the past is typically unchangeable and can be trusted to depict true
events.

*- Psychometry (+2):* Activation of this power requires touching an
object. You can then perceive possible futures or past events related to
the object and anyone who may have possessed it.

\<Side Bar\>

**Seeing The Future**

Precognition and Retrocognition can be complex powers, and some
Editors-in-Chief may choose to disallow them entirely. However, they can
also serve as powerful storytelling tools. Consider granting heroes with
precognition occasional flashes of the future, even when undesired, to
plant seeds for future stories or guide them along the right path. Also,
consider making visions of the future or past increasingly vague the
further they are from the present. Retrocognition at a murder scene, for
example, might reveal the murderer as a mere shadowy figure but provide
details like the method of murder or the escape route.

\</Side Bar\>

### \<h3\>Psychic Attack

Damaging, Ranged

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom or Charisma

**Action:** Action

**Attack:** Willpower

**Burnout:** 4

*You generate blasts of psychic power that can fry a man’s synapse.*

**Effect:** You manifest a blast of psychic energy in your opponent’s
mind, dealing your power score’s base die in psychic damage. *Psychic*
attacks are a particular case; due to their nature, *they ignore DR from
any source that* does not explicitly protect against it. However, it
also has no effect against zombies (even super zombies) unless they
possess a weakness for psychic damage.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Telepathy, Mind Control, Super-Sense: Mental
Detection.

*Power Tricks:* Psychic Scream

\</sidebar\>

### Power Trick: Psychic Scream

**Powers:** Psychic Attack

**Cost:** +3 Burnout

**Effect:** A Hero can attack all the minds in an adjacent area rather
than attack a single mind.

\</sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Regeneration

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Constitution

*You have a hyper-natural healing factor.*

**Effect:** This power has several effects:

- You regain your power score modifier in Stamina at the end of your
  turn.

- You add your power score modifier to all Constitution saving throws to
  resist the effects of poisons and toxins or to end the poisoned
  condition.

- You can heal from normal disease and regrow a lost limb (requiring as
  long as healing a wound). Strangely, this power makes you more
  susceptible to the Z-Virus, reducing your Fortitude against being
  turned by one-half your power score modifier.

- If you suffer Wound damage, you stop regaining Stamina at an increased
  rate. You reduced the time needed to heal a wound by a number of hours
  equal to your power score modifier (minimum 1 hour). You can heal an
  additional wound after a long rest by making a wound recovery roll as
  usual with a gain a bonus equal to double your power score modifier.

So, for instance, if you possess Regeneration 22, you would
automatically heal a wound every 18 hours. After completing a long rest,
you can then make a wound recovery roll with a +6 bonus to recover an
additional wound.

### \<h3\>Repulsion 

Range, Primary

**Primary Ability:** Charisma

**Action:** Action

**Attack:** Discipline

**Burnout:** 5

*You can force a creature to flee from you.*

**Effect:** Choose a maximum number of creatures within a range equal to
one-half your power score modifier. Paying 5 burnout for each creature
you attempt to effect, make a Power Attack roll against their Discipline
defense. If you are successful, that target must make every effort
beyond harming itself to remain outside the range of this power for a
number of minutes equal to your power score modifier. At the end of
their turn, those affected by your power can make a Wisdom saving throw
against your powers passive power DC to end this effect.  
**Special (Limitation):** You may limit this power to only working on a
particular creature type. Common creatures like zombies or broadly
defined groups like the living are a +1 Flaw, while uncommon creatures
or specific groups like demons or worshipers of the Elder Gods may be as
high as +3.

### \<h3\>Resistance

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Constitution

*You possess a remarkable resilience to most forms of damage.*

**Effect:** Choose one of the following damage sources: physical,
energy, psychic, or damage from magical effects. You add your power
score modifier to your Fortitude defense to resist massive damage when
attacked by your chosen source. You may limit this power to a particular
damage type (for example, Fire), in which case you increase this power’s
score by +6

This power does not protect you against disease, poison, or
environmental effects.

**Special (Limitations):** You cannot choose a source of damage against
which you are vulnerable or a fatal flaw against.

### \<h3\>Shape Shift 

Scene

**Primary Ability:** Constitution or Intelligence

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 5

*You can change your form to look like someone else.*

**Effect:** You can change your physical form, clothing, and voice to
appear as someone you have personally met or observed (for example,
through surveillance video). Any time someone who knows your target
meets you, they may perform a single Perception (Intelligence) check
against your power’s passive DC to notice something “off” with your
disguise, which may or may not raise suspicion.

This power does not grant you any knowledge held by your subject,
powers, feats, or skills. As such, the Editor-in-Chief may require you
to attempt ability or skill checks to pull off the disguise.

Once you reach a power score of 20+, you may copy any of your subject’s
personal quirks if you have directly observed them, granting your power
score modifier to all ability and skill checks to pull off your
disguise.

**Special (Combining Effects, Mimic):** You can combine this power with
Mimic to take on someone else’s powers and physical appearance as a
Demanding action. When doing so, you only pay one-half the Burnout from
each power, rounded up.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* enhanced attack (growing claws), fly (growing wings),
multiple limbs

### \<h3\>Shrink

Scene

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 5

*You can reduce your overall size.*

**Effect:** You can reduce your overall size by a number of sizes
depending upon your power score (see table below), up to a maximum of
*smaller than tiny.* Each decrease in size costs 5 burnout points. For
each size decrease, your mass is cut in half, your Strength score is
reduced by 2, and your Avoidance Defense is increased by 1. Alternately,
for an additional 4 burnout, you may retain your Strength score,
regardless of your size. You may end the effect of this power as a bonus
action.

For example, if your power score modifier is 25, you could decrease your
size by up to 3 categories, from Medium to small to tiny to less than
tiny, paying 15 burnout points (5 for each size increase). You would
gain an -8 penalty to your strength score and a +3 bonus to your
avoidance defense.

See Creature Sizes pg XX for additional effects.

attack)

### \<h3\>Sixth Sense

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

*You can sense when danger is just around the corner.*

**Effect:** You cannot be surprised. Additionally, you gain a bonus to
all defenses equal to your power score modifier against the first attack
against you in any given scene or when someone attacks you that would
have surprised you if it was not for this power.

### \<h3\>Speed

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Dexterity

*You are simply faster... much faster.*

**Effect:** This power increases your Pace by your power score modifier.
This power also grants you the ability to travel and maneuver with your
power at high speeds safely; for example, you are not damaged by a sonic
boom you created when running, or if you create sheets of ice to skate
on, you’re not going to slip.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Temporal Fugue

### \<h3\>Summon Animal 

Scene, Ranged

**Primary Attribute:** Charisma

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 8 + Special

*You can summon aid from what is left in nature.*

**Effect:** You summon an animal that appears at your side at the
beginning of your next turn. The threat level of the animal you can
summon is limited by your power score (see table below). You may use
this ability to summon more than one animal at a time, up to a maximum
equal to half your power score modifier, but at an additional burnout
cost of +5 for each animal beyond the first. You can only use this power
once per scene.

Tech Heroes Summoning Animals

At first, you might think... wait… what? Remember, you can alter a
power’s “flavor” to better fit your hero’s concept as long as the
effects remain the same. So, while a Tech Hero would be limited to the
more restrictive version of this power, they’re assumed to possess a
mechanical version of whatever animal they wish to summon and have it
readily available. In addition, you can even give these mechanical
creatures a different form. For example, while you may choose wolves for
your mechanical animals, they could look like mechanical pit bulls or
even giant spiders instead! Just talk your ideas out with the
Editor-in-Chief, and be creative in the spirit of shaping your Hero, not
in trying to “break” the game

\</side bar\>

### \<h3\>Super-Sense

Continuous, Range (Varies, see below)

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

*You can see things that others cannot.*

**Effect:** Unlike Enhanced Senses, this power grants you either a new
way of using one of your senses or a new one, such as the ability to
detect the minds of others telepathically.

When you choose this power, you must select one of the following
super-senses.

- Hearing

  - Sonar

  - Super Hearing

  - Remote Listen

- Magical

  - Sense Magical Auras

  - Extradimensional Sensitivity

- Mental

  - Detect Minds

  - Head for numbers

  - Sense of Direction

  - Sense of Time

  - Speed Reading

- Sight

  - Low Light Vision

  - Night-Vision

  - Microscopic Vision

  - Telescopic Vision.

  - Thermal Vision

  - X-Ray Vision

- Smell

  - Tracking

- Technological

  - Sense Tech

  - Motion Sensor

- Touch

  - Hyper-touch

Your sense’s range is equal to your power score modifier. The
Editor-in-Chief may require you to make a Power Check in response to
opposing powers or extraordinary conditions. You are limited to your
normal vision range unless you possess Super-Sense (Telescopic Vision).

**Hearing**

*Sonar*: You can “see” soundwaves, creating a detailed three-dimensional
picture of the surrounding area. Due to your heightened sensitivity to
sound, attacks that utilize sound attack you with Advantage as long as
this power is active.

*Super-Hearing:* You can hear low and high frequencies, radar waves, or
radio and television transitions. You gain a bonus to all Perception
checks based on hearing equal to your power score bonus due to your
heightened sensitivity to sound; attacks that utilize sound attack you
with Advantage as long as this power is active.

*Remote Listen:* you can listen to sounds in an area a number of areas
away equal to your power score modifier.

**Magical**

*Sense Magical Auras:* You can automatically feel the presence of active
magical effects within a number of areas equal to half your power score
modifier (minimum of the same area). Alternately, as an action, you can
detect the presence of passive magical auras (emanating from magical
items or even transcribed spells) or the lingering effects of magic use
with a Power Check against a DC equal to the number of days since that
magical event transpired. Once you reach a power score of 30, your
sensitivity is such that you also automatically feel the presence of
passive magical auras within your area.

*Extradimensional Sensitivity:* a strangely unique and rare sense, you
can automatically feel any extradimensional rift or transportation
within a number of miles equal to your power score modifier. You can
also sense the presence of extradimensional creatures within a number of
areas equal to your power score modifier; you may be required to make a
power score check against the creature’s discipline defense or power
passive DC of a power an extradimensional creature is actively using in
an attempt to hide its presence.

**Mental**

*Detect Minds:* As a bonus action you can detect the presence of active
minds, living creatures with an intelligence of 3 or more, within range.
By using a demanding action, you can pinpoint the locations of all minds
within range. You can also recognize minds you personally know (friends
and people you have met). The Editor-in-chief may require a Power Check
to recognize a mind you have not “seen” in a while; this sense is
considered a Mental Power.

*Head for Numbers:* You can do complex calculations in your head. In
addition, the Editor-in-Chief may allow you to add the power score
modifier to appropriate Engineering skill checks when making repairs or
building new equipment or gadgets.

*Sense of Direction:* You always know where north (or another set
direction) is, making getting lost difficult. You get a bonus equal to
your Passive Modifier when making any Intelligence rolls to determine
where you currently are or when trying to find your way out of a maze,
navigate a suburban sprawl, remember the path you took to get where you
are, and so on.

*Sense of Time:* You always know what time it is and do not need a
watch. This lets you know how much time you have left before sundown,
how long you need to wait before springing an ambush, how long you need
to leave something in the oven, and so on. It is a useful skill in a
world where working clocks and watches are getting harder and harder to
find each passing day.

*Speed Reading:* You can easily read a page of material at a glance and
examine in a matter of minutes what might take other hours to read.
Combined with Celerity, you can read large volumes as quickly as you can
turn the pages.

**Sight**

*Low-Light Vision:* You can see normally in shadowy conditions and
outdoors at night under a starlit sky or when the moon is bright.
Additionally, the amount of detail you can perceive in such conditions
is extraordinary. Add half your power score modifier to perception skill
checks under such conditions.

*Night-Vision:* You can see in complete darkness up to a range equal to
your power score modifier (minimum of the area you occupy).
Additionally, the amount of detail you can perceive in such conditions
is extraordinary. Add half your power score modifier to perception skill
checks under such conditions, but this comes at a cost. If you are
exposed to bright lights when using your Night Vision, you are blinded
until the end of your next turn.

*Microscopic Vision:* You suffer no penalties on Perception (Wisdom)
checks utilizing sight up to the magnification level equal to the
power’s score. This power may be used with any other vision-based Super
Sense.

Power Score of 10-13: x10 — can see fingerprints, 14-17: x50 — can see
plankton. 18-19: x100 — can see individual cells and single-celled
organisms such as amoeba. 20-25: x500 — can see internal cell structure.
26-29: x1,000 —can see objects measured in microns. 30-35 x5,000, 36-39
x10,000 40-45: x50,000, 46-49: x100,000, 50+: x500,000 — can see
individual atoms.

*Telescopic vision:* You suffer no penalties on *perception checks to a
number of areas equal to the power score, which* may be used in
conjunction with any other vision-based super sense.

*Thermal Vision:* You can perceive the infrared spectrum, allowing you
to see temperature differences in the area around you. Limited to half
your power score modifier (minimum of the area you occupy), this power
allows you to see in the dark, as well as perceive the heat signatures
of any living target. However, it’s not so useful against the undead,
whose body temperature closely matches the temperature of the area
around them. As such, you gain a bonus (min +0) to perception (wisdom)
checks to see living creatures, but undead are *undetectable* when
perceived through thermal vision.

*X-ray vision:* You may only see-through objects with a Material
Strength equal to or less than your passive power DC.

**Smell**

*Tracking:* Choose a target who has passed through your current location
within a number of days equal to your power score, you add double power
score modifier (min of +2) to all a skill checks when tracking that
target.

**Technological**

*Sense Tech:* You can automatically feel the presence of active magical
effects within a number of areas equal to your power score modifier
(minimum of 1). Alternately, as an action, you can detect the presence
of passive technology, such as acting in hibernation mode or low power
settings enough to blend into the background.

*Motion Sensor:* You can detect motion up to a number of areas equal to
your range. Any creature that moves more than 1 area per turn sets off
your sensor, and you can pinpoint its exact location.

**Touch**

*Hyper-Touch*: you can “read the ink off pages by tracing your fingers
over the words; as a bonus action, you can feel the air move around you,
giving you the ability to detect movement in the same area in the right
conditions. Additionally, as an action, you can touch the ground and
feel movement within range and even pinpoint it with a successful Power
Check with a DC equal to the MS of the material the movement is taking
place on. For example, *Jaeger* takes a moment to touch the floor and
feel out the building, possessing a Super Sense (Hyper-Touch): 20 he can
“feel” up to 5 areas, rolling against the MS of concrete (DC: 20) he can
sense the presence and pin-points the current location of 15 zombies
scattered about on the floors above him.

**Special (Access):** You may take this power multiple times, choosing a
different sense each time, with each sense being tracked as its power.
You may only have one super-sense active at any particular time;
switching between them requires a bonus action.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* You can emulate a sense of the same sense group for
which you have a power. For example, if you possess Super Sense (Sonar),
you can learn Super Sense (Hyper-Hearing) as an emulated power.

### \<h3\>Surge 

**Primary Ability:** Dexterity

**Burnout:** 5

*You are capable of incredible bursts of speed.*

**Effect:** When you acquire this power, you must choose a mode of
movement: flying, jumping, running, or swimming.

When utilizing your chosen movement mode, you increase your Pace by
double your power score modifier until the end of your next turn. This
power does not grant the ability to fly; it only gives you a boost of
speed while flying if your chosen mode of movement is flight.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Temporal Fugue

### \<h3\>Swinging

**Primary Ability:** Dexterity

**Burnout:** 1

*You possess the incredible ability to swing from one point to another
with incredible speed and precision.*  
**Effect:** You gain the ability to swing from structures and objects
within range. When using this power, you must be within a number of
areas equal to half your power score modifier (min of 2)

of a structure or object for your power to anchor onto. Once attached,
you can swing from the structure or object with a fly pace equal to your
power score modifier, with maneuverability dependent upon your power
score (see Flying power above). Alternately, once your power is
anchored, you can climb up a structure at a speed equivalent to half
your power score modifier. While swinging, you may reduce your power
score by 2 to increase your maneuverability by one category: Clumsy to
Agile or Agile to Perfect.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Entangle, Glide

### \<h3\>Sympathy 

Ranged

**Primary Attribute:** Wisdom

**Action:** Bonus

**Attack:** Discipline

**Burnout:** 2

*You can sense the emotions of others.*

**Effect:** Make a Power Attack against a target’s Discipline defense.
If successful, you learn the dominant emotion present in your target. If
the target is deliberately lying, this emotion will be deception, though
other situations might cause deception to be a dominant emotion as well.
This is a mental power, and as such, it does not work on zombies or
non-sentient targets.

**Power Stunts:**

*Power Tricks:* Read the Crowd  
  
\<Sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Power Trick 

#### \<h4\> Read the Crowd 

**Powers:** Sympathy

Range, Scene

**Primary Ability:** Charisma

**Action:** Action

**Attack:** Discipline

**Burnout:** 3

*You can read and transmit thoughts.*

**Effect:** You can connect with another person’s mind and communicate.
You can also read surface thoughts (making interrogations more
effective). To connect with a person’s mind, you must have a willing
subject or make a power attack against their Discipline defense to force
the link. At the end of their turn, your target may attempt to sever the
connection with a successful Charisma saving throw.

Zombies are considered mindless for purposes of telepathy, though there
are disturbing rumors that Super Z’s with telepathic abilities are able
to communicate with each other.

**Power Stunts:**

*Emulated Powers:* Psychic Attack, Force Field (against mental attacks
only), Heal the Psyche, Mind Control, Super-Sense: Mental Detection,
Sympathy

*Power Tricks:* Link Minds*,* Mental Deep-Dive

\<Sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Power Tricks 

#### \<h4\> Link Minds

**Powers:** Telepathy

**Cost:** +3 Burnout

subjects equal to your power score modifier; all linked creatures
communicate telepathically with each other and are aware of each other’s
actions and condition.

#### \<h4\> Mental Deep Dive

**Powers:** Telepathy

**Cost:** +3 Burnout

**Effect:** Once a telepathic link is established, you may attempt to
delve deeper into the target's memories. To do so, you need to perform a
second power attack roll against their Discipline defense; if
successful, you can gleam into their memories and maybe find the
information they are trying to keep from you. If your target is unaware,
they know something of use to you, the editor-in-chief may require you
to roll an Investigation (Intelligence) skill check as you shift through
your target's memories.

\</Sidebar\>

Range

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Action

**Burnout:** 8

Appearing in an unoccupied space in your target area. Depending on your
power source, this transportation may involve going through alternate
planes of reality or disassembling your molecules and moving at quantum
speeds.

**Power Stunts:**

\</sidebar\>

### \<H3\>Power Trick \<H4\>Alonge for the ride

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Intelligence or Wisdom

*You can speak and understand unknown languages*

**Effect:** You can understand the intelligent speech of other beings
and communicate understandably in their language, even if you do not
share a common language. To understand them or make yourself understood,
make a Power Check with a difficulty based on the complexity of the
ideas to be communicated. Very simple ideas like “Danger, Zombies!” DC:
10. Typical ideas like “I greet you in peace” DC: 15. More complex ideas
like complicated battle plans or philosophical ideas would be DC: 20 or
more difficult. Languages related to one you speak naturally, such as
the family of Romance languages, have their DC reduced by 10. Non-human
languages, or truly cryptic dead languages like Enochian or Atlantean,
have their DC increased by 5. This power does not allow you to
communicate with beings who do not have a language or do not have the
intelligence to understand a language. However, at the Editor-in-Chief’s
discretion, they may allow you to understand and communicate in
non-verbal languages.

### \<h3\>Tunnel

**Primary Ability:** Strength

**Burnout:** 4

*You can burrow through solids as if swimming.*

**Effect:** As an action, you can dig through the ground at a burrow

**Action: Action**

**Attack:** Discipline (for Mental Ability Score) or Fortitude (for
Physical Ability Scores)

**Burnout:** 4

*Your attacks weaken the attributes of your targets*

**Effect:** When you first choose this power, choose an ability score.
Upon a successful power attack roll, your target suffers a penalty to
that ability score equal to your power score modifier; this power cannot
decrease the score of an ability score below 1.  
**Special (Access):** You can take this power multiple times, choosing a
different ability score, with each being tracked as its own power. You
may activate all versions of this power at once with no additional
Burnout cost as long as they are attacking the same group of ability
scores (Physical or Mental). Additionally, if you are attempting to
affect both Physical and Mental ability scores at the same time, your
power must overcome the higher of the target’s Discipline or Fortitude
defenses.

**Special (Linked):** If this power is *Linked* with another attack
power, you may use both powers in tandem; when you do so, you only make
an attack roll for the power to which weaken is linked to. If that
attack roll hits and also overcomes the target’s Discipline (for Mental
Attributes) or Fortitude (for Physical Attributes), then this power
affects the target as well.

synergizing Poison and Weaken.

*Emulated Powers:* Poison (for Physical Attributes), Emotion Control
(for Mental Attributes) *Power Tricks:* Mass Weakness

### \<h3\>Wall Crawl

Continuous

**Primary Ability:** Strength

*You can climb walls as if you were walking or running.*

**Effect:** You gain a Climb Pace equal to your power score modifier and
can climb on any hard surface. The editor-in-chief may require you to
perform power checks to resist being ripped off a surface or to stick
onto a particularly slick surface.

Alternately, this power can be used to resist unwanted movement (such as
knockback and similar effects), allowing you to add this power score
modifier to your Athletics skill checks and Strength saving throws to
resist these effects.

**Special (Power Modification)** *Climbing:* if you state you need a
realistic surface to climb on with potential hand holds and forgo the
ability to restrict unwanted movement you gain a +4 bonus to this
power’s power score. If you choose this power modification, you may
apply all skill power modifications to this power.

### \<h3\>Wireless

Range

**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

**Action:** Demanding

**Burnout:** 3

*You are a human-computer connection.*

**Effect:** You can wirelessly communicate with any computer or
electronics within range, regardless of whether it has an access port.
You instinctively know the basic parameters of the device and can
manipulate it using the greater of either your *Technology* skill or
your power score modifier. You can also use this power to overcome
security programs that deny access by making a Power Check against a DC
set by your Editor-in-Chief.

**Special (Techno-Telepathy):** While you cannot hack Androids or
Artificial Intelligence with this power, you can use it to communicate
with them as if you possessed Telepathy at the same power score.

**Power Stunt**  
*Emulated Power:* Mind Control (Androids and Artificial Intelligence
only)

### \<h3\>Weird Biology 

Continuous

**Primary Attribute:** Constitution

*Your biology resists most normal afflictions*

**Effect:** You gain a bonus equal to your power score modifier (minimum
+1) on any roll to resist disease, poison, or other physical malady, and
as a bonus to your defense against any attack from diseases, poisons, or
other physical malady, including powers like Poison.

**Note:** This power pairs well with the Dependence Disadvantage (p. X).
A hero whose weird biology makes them resistant to normal diseases and
poisons may also derive no nourishment from normal foods and require a
specialized diet.

\<side bar\>

Resisting the Z-Virus Can the Z-Virus be resisted like a normal disease?
That depends on the Editor-in-Chief’s setting. In the Paradigm City
setting, it can, and while those with Weird Biology or other resistant
powers can be infected, it is harder to do so. However, in a setting
where the Z-Virus is supernatural in nature or an omnicontagion, this
power may have no effect against it (See Zombies and Non-Humans (p.49)
for more

\<side bar\>

# \<h2\>Power Modifications (Flaws and Perks)

Once you have bought all your powers, you may choose to apply Power
Modifications to any or all of them. Power Modifications change the way
your power works in some way and will either increase or decrease your
final power score*.* For instance, the *Conditional* Flaw would grant
you a +4 to your final power scores, while the Secondary Effect Perk
would reduce your final power score by -2 or -4, depending on what
effect you choose.

- You may not apply perks to power if these perks reduce a power’s final
  score below 10.

- If a power’s final score, after modifications, exceeds your power
  score cap (20 + 5 × your rank), it is capped at this maximum. Any
  points above the cap are considered untapped potential. As you
  increase in rank, you can utilize the power’s score up to the new rank
  cap.

- You may acquire Power Modifications after Hero creation, but only at
  the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, but your rank cap still limits you.

#### Build example: two heroes, same powers.

Below, we have built two Hero examples; each one has the same powers:
Entangle, Energy Blast, Force Field, Move Object, and Fly.

Our first Hero is *Force,* your classic Super-Hero. Being a big fan of
classic telekinetic heroes, Pete starts by choosing the Linked flaw,
stating that all his powers are manifestations of his Telekinesis. Then,
being a young Hero (with the Young Gun flaw), he chooses to add the
Fatiguing flaw to all his powers to represent how taxing his powers are
upon his young body.

Our next Hero, *Flak*, is being created by Nelson to be a Tech Hero. His
first piece of gear is his “force jacket,” which allows him to generate
and manipulate force fields. Choosing to integrate Entangle, Force
Field, and Move Object into the suit, he applies the External Power
Source as well as the Linked and Removable Object flaws to the jacket’s
powers. His next piece of gear would be his cybernetic plasma blasters.
Choosing the Energy Blast power, he then applies the External Energy
Source and the Implant flaw. His last piece of gear will consist of a
pair of “Rocket Boots,” which allow him to fly, applying both the
External Energy Source and Removable Object flaws.

### \<h3\>Accurate (Perk -2) 

*Your control over your power is quite impressive.*

**Restriction:** This perk can only be applied to a power that attacks
one of the three defenses

**Effect:** you gain a +2 bonus to hit with the power this perk is
applied to.

### \<h3\>Aquatic Power (Perk/Flaw -1/+2)

*Your power works just fine underwater*

**Restriction:** This perk can only be applied to a power with a range

**Effect:** Your power’s range is not halved when using it underwater.
You may choose to apply this power modification as a flaw, halving the
power’s range when used when not underwater.

\<sidebar\>

### Editor’s Note: Keeping it Gritty.

Power Flaws offer great potential for abuse, especially if they’re
stacked. That said, it’s your game, and as Editor-in-Chief, you can deny
any Modifiers or combinations you feel are unbalanced.

\</sidebar\>

### \<h3\>All-Skill (Perk +0)

**Effect:** All your powers are not the result of some inborn ability,
magical powers, or high-tech gadgetry but are instead pure skill and
conditioning. You have pushed your body to its limits, allowing you to
do what may at first seem super-human.

This power modifier may only be applied to specific powers, as shown
under Table X-X: Powers. With the exceptions of the Linked and Fatiguing
flaws, no other power modifications may be applied to a power with the
All-Skill perk. If you choose to apply this Perk to a power with a
Burnout value, that power’s burnout value is increased by +1

**Special (Power Limit):** Sadly, skill will only take you so far. With
the exception of Enhanced Attack with a chosen weapon or martial arts,
powers with the All-Skill perk are limited to a power score of 20

### \<h3\>Conditional (Flaw +4)

*Your power only works part of the time.*

**Effect:** Perhaps it only works at night, while you’re bathed in
sunlight or underwater. In any case, your power should be useless at
least half the time.

### \<h3\>Critical Depletion (Flaw +6) 

**Restriction:** Power must have a Burnout value.

**Effect:** Any time you use a power with the Critical Depletion flaw,
you become instantly burned out, as if you have surpassed your burnout
threshold and rolled a 1 on your burnout check.

### \<h3\>Cybernetic Implant (Flaw +2)

*Your power is not the product of a genetic mutation but rather unique
cybernetic implants.*

**Effect:** Any time you suffer *Massive Damage* (pg. XX), the
Editor-in-Chief may have this power malfunction until the end of the
scene (as your implants are assumed to have basic self-repair systems).
You may “reboot” power during the same scene with an expenditure of a
plot point.

**Special (Flaw Limitation):** As cybernetic implants are part of you,
you cannot combine this flaw with the Removable Item modifier.

### \<h3\>Distant Power (Perk -1) 

*Your power has increased reach*

**Restriction:** This Perk can only be applied to Ranged powers.

**Effect:** The power’s range is doubled.

### \<H3\>Dual-Natured Attack (Perk -2) 

**Effect:** Apply this power modification to a power that deals damage.
The damage dealt by that power now deals damage as if it possesses two
energy types simultaneously.  
If you hit a foe that has vulnerability to one of the two energy types
that make up your power, then it is determined normally. If, by chance,
your target is Vulnerable to both of your energy types, then apply both
sets of effects. If your target is resistant to one of your energy types
but not the other, the resistance is cut in half to a minimum of the
lower Resistance Power or DR.  
**Examples**: A Hero who hurls masses of magma would have a Dual-Natured
Energy Blast consisting of earth (kinetic) and fire. Another Hero may
have weather control powers that combine wind and frost (kinetic and
cold) or lightning and thunder (electricity and sonic).

### \<H3\>Efficient Power (Perk -2) 

**Restriction:** This Perk may only be applied to a power with a Burnout
value.

**Effect:** When you do so, decrease the power’s Burnout cost by 1.

**Special:** This Perk cannot be applied to a Power with the Fatiguing
Flaw.

### \<H3\>Ego (Flaw Variable) 

**Restriction:** Power must also have the External Power Source Flaw,
and all powers that share this external power source also share the same
ego.

**Effect:** Your external power source has a will of its own. Perhaps it
holds the spirit of an ancient mage or an artificial intelligence.
Perhaps it simply influences you along a certain path. But it wants
something from you, and it is often difficult to resist. This flaw is
made up of three parts: Alignment, Will, and Release. Add up the scores
of these three characteristics to get the final score bonus applied to
the power. While the item is in control, you can still communicate with
the item with it mentally in order to bargain, though otherwise, your
hero is not in control of their actions.

- **Alignment:** This is the desire of the item and what it wants you to
  do. Keep in mind that since this item can, at times, possess you, some
  alignments might not be suitable. Being occasionally possessed by a
  demonic sword that thirsts for the blood of the innocent, for
  instance, will likely disrupt the game and cause more issues than it’s
  worth.

  - If this is in line with what you would do anyway, such as killing
    zombies or protecting your Enclave, gain +0 to your power score.

  - If this desire complicates matters, like questing for an ancient
    item or adhering to a strict moral code, gain +1 to your power
    score.

  - If this desire makes things very difficult, like amassing and
    jealously guarding a treasure horde, gain +2 to your power score.

- **Will:** This determines how difficult the influence is to resist.
  Whenever there is an opportunity for you to fulfill the source’s
  alignment, and you choose not to do so, you must make a Wisdom or
  Charisma saving throw against a Difficulty determined below. If you
  fail this saving throw, the source takes control of you as if you were
  under the effect of the Mind Control power with a power score equal to
  the DC of the save.

  - DC: 10 +0 to your power score

  - DC: 15 +2 to your power score

  - DC: 20 +4 to your power score

- **Release:** This determines how willing the item is to release the
  holder from its power after the holder fails a roll against the item’s
  Will.

  - For +0 to your power score, the item will be released to the holder
    as soon as its immediate action is concluded.

  - For +1 to your power score, the item may control the holder longer,
    so long as it is in immediate pursuit of its Alignment.

  - For +2 to your power score, the item believes it can do better in
    control. It will not relinquish that control unless it is
    successfully bargained with, threatened, or otherwise forced or
    persuaded.

\<side bar\>

Playing Ego-Possessed Heroes  
The editor-in-chief should consider letting the player continue playing
as their hero when an item with Ego possesses them. They simply play the
hero with the item’s personality, but the player **must** pursue the
item’s alignment to the exclusion of all else.

\</side bar\>

### \<h3\>Exclusive Power (Flaw +2) 

**Restriction:** May only be used with Scene or Continuous powers. It
may not be combined with Roulette Power. At least two powers must both
possess this flaw.

**Effect:** Two or more of your powers may not be used at the same time.
Whenever you activate a power with this flaw, it instantly deactivates
all other powers with this flaw.

### \<h3\>External Power Source (Perk +0)

*With this modification, powers are powered by an external source, such
as a power pack, ammunition, or mystical power from the beyond.*

**Restriction:** This may only be applied to powers with a burnout
value.

**Effect:** This power source possesses its Burnout Threshold equal to
10 + the highest power score modifier + 1 for each additional power
beyond the first that taps into that power source.

Unless you’re a Tech Hero, you may only possess a single External Power
Source that multiple powers may tap into.

**Example:** If you apply an external power source to energy blast: 20
(+5), force shield: 18 (+4), your external power source would have a
Burnout Threshold of 16

### \<h3\>Fatiguing (Flaw +4)

**Restriction:** This power modification cannot be combined with power
modification, which reduces or removes burnout costs.

**Effect:** This flaw may only be applied to a power with a Burnout
cost; increase the power’s burnout cost by half Burnout cost (minimum of
1).

### \<h3\>Instinct Control (Perk -2/-4) 

**Effect:** This perk can be applied to a Mental Power. This Mental
Power can now affect either non-sentient animals with a brain or
non-sentient computer systems advanced enough to mimic the intelligence
of animals with a brain (such as most modern computers). It can affect
one of these categories for -2 or both of them for -4. This power still
cannot affect brainless animals like jellyfish or mechanical systems
that are not controlled by a modern computer.

### \<h3\>Joined Power (Flaw +2, +4) 

**Restriction:** Cannot be applied to a power with the All-Skill Flaw

**Effect:** You must choose a hero with the joined power flaw. If both
agree, those powers cannot be used without both of you being in close
proximity to one another. For +2 power score, both you and your joined
companion must be in the same Area. For +4 power score, both of you must
be in the same Area while touching each other. You may not overcome this
flaw as long as your companion is alive or remains a zombie. If your
companion is truly dead, the editor-n-chef may allow you to buy off this
flaw with experience.

### \<h3\>Limited Uses (Flaw +2, +4, +6)

**Effect:** Your power runs off a limited power source; maybe you
deliver your elemental blast power through arrows or specialized
gyro-jet ammunition, or your body needs time to recharge. Regardless,
this power limits the number of times you may use the power in question
on a given day. You do not suffer burnout when utilizing power with this
power modification.

- You may use your power twice before requiring a short rest, +2 power
  score

- You may use your power once before requiring a short rest, +4 power
  score

- You may use your power once before requiring a long rest, +6 power
  score

Alternately, you may, at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, be able to
rearm/recharge between scenes with the expenditure of a Plot point.

### \<h3\>Limitation (Flaw +2, +4, or +6)

**Effect:** A power with this limitation does not work under specific
conditions or against specific items, materials, or even items with
particular characteristics.

Maybe your Fire Powers are unable to affect water. So, your
Elemental/Energy Blast (Fire) will not work against someone with
Elemental/Energy Sheath (Water or Ice). Or you may not be able to use
any of your fire powers while in a heavy downpour.

At the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, this Power Flaw may be worth a +2,
+4, or +6 in your power score, depending on how common the vulnerability
may be. For example, water may be worth +4 due to its prevalence, while
a vulnerability to refined uranium would be worth +2.

\<Side Bar\>

#### Alternate uses for the Limitation Power Flaw

You may utilize the Limitation power flaw to facilitate countless
possible flaws and limitations. But be forewarned, players may use this
flaw to tweak out their heroes and enhance their powers for little or no
cost.

To see some interesting uses of the Limitation flaw, see the *Allies and
Rogues Gallery* section**.**

\</Side Bar\>

### \<h3\>Linked (Flaw +2)

**Effect:** This tweak must be applied to more than one power. All
powers with this flaw are linked together through a central theme. For
example, Force has all his powers linked together as they are all tied
to his telekinesis power. Each power in the linked power group gains a
+2 bonus to its power score.

When using any power that is part of a group of linked powers, you
always utilize the lowest power score among them, regardless of whether
the power you are using has a higher power score.

### \<h3\>Magical Spell (+0 Flaw) 

**Restriction:** Heroes with the Mystic Power Source only.

**Effects:** Powers with this Perk are not “powers” per se, but instead
spells mastered by the Hero. Powers converted to spells have the
following properties:

The primary attribute for power is changed to either Charisma,
Intelligence, or Wisdom. This choice must be made when first taking the
spell and cannot be changed. All other aspects of power remain
unchanged.

As you continue to grow, you may increase the power score of your spells
like you would any other power. Perhaps you find a more efficient way to
weave the magic, or your connection to the mystical realm has grown
stronger over time.

Any practitioner can teach their spells to another practitioner at the
discretion of the Editor-in-Chief. They may use the learned spell with a
power score of 12 (or the spell power level, whichever is lower) for the
use of a plot point until they fully acquire it via the Acquire New
Power feat, at which point they gain the spell at its full power level
(minimum of 12). The primary attribute of a learned spell does not
change.

### \<h3\>Patron (Flaw +0/+2/+4/+6) 

**Effect:** Your power is not inherent to you but has been granted by a
powerful being such as an alien, a god, a devil, or even a surviving
A-lister. If you should offend this patron, they will withdraw this
power until you have appeased them and may further punish you.

- If your patron makes few demands of you or has demands that are in
  line with what you would be doing anyway (such as fighting Zombies or
  helping humans to survive), this Flaw is worth +0.

- +2 if your patron is mostly benevolent but expects you to maintain a
  code of behavior or makes occasional demands that complicate your
  normal activities.

- +4 if your patron has their own agenda apart from yours and expects
  you to follow it when they demand.

- +6, your patron is actively working against you, trying to ensnare you
  in an evil bargain, working against your Enclave or in favor of the
  zombies, or is otherwise evil.

> At the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, a powerful patron might grant a
> power to those not normally able to access it. For instance, a deal
> with a devil might grant a Skill Hero the Bestial Transformation
> ability. This should involve a great deal of sacrifice and become a -2
> Perk (for benevolent patrons) or, at most, a +1 Flaw (for evil
> patrons).

\<side bar\>  
Evil Patrons

Making deals with evil patrons has the potential to cause a lot of
problems in a campaign, but it also has the potential for some truly
amazing character arcs. In most stories, making a deal with an evil
patron comes in one of two varieties. In the first, the Hero does not
realize the patron is evil and only gradually becomes aware that the
seemingly innocuous tasks they are required to perform are leading
toward some terribly evil goal. In the second, the Hero is desperately
in need of power in order to overcome some great obstacle (such as a
zombie horde) and knowingly makes a pact with an evil patron out of
desperation or hubris. Regardless of the method, eventually, an evil
patron will either fully corrupt a Hero (which should then become an
NPC), or the Hero will have to turn against their patron, being stripped
of their powers and possibly paying further penalties as a consequence
of breaking their bargain. Deals with evil patrons, even unknowing,
should always cause more problems than they solved  
\</side bar\>

### \<h3\>Penetrating (Perk -2)

**Effect:** Your power is particularly effective against armor, natural
or otherwise. This power modification can only be applied to a power
that attacks one of the three defenses. Upon a successful attack, you
bypass some of your opponent’s DR equal to half your power score
modifier (minimum 1)

### \<h3\>Power Armor (Flaw +4)

**Requirement:** Tech Hero Only

**Effect:** Power Armor represents an armored suit that empowers and
protects you.

When creating a suit of power armor, you can apply this power
modification to any number of powers, as long as one of those powers is
the Armor power.

- All Power Armor possesses the following power modifications but gains
  no power score bonuses from their application: *Removable Item,
  External Power Source* (with the external power source’s Burnout
  Threshold being increased by the Hero’s passive Intelligence
  modifier), and *Unpowered Form* (with the time required to put on the
  armor being two continuous Demanding actions instead of one. You may
  reduce this time to a single Demanding action by reducing the bonus
  points granted by this flaw by 2).

- You may apply additional power modifications to powers independently,
  but they are limited to accuracy, fatigue, limited uses, linked,
  penetration, secondary effect, and static.

**Special (Multiple Suits):** You may possess more than one suit of
armor. This flaw applies to individual power suits, with the powers of
each suit tracked as individual powers.

### \<h3\>Power Lapse (Flaw +2/+4) 

**Effect:** Your power shuts down until the end of your next turn if
attacked in a specific manner. For common conditions, such as being
attacked by steel weapons, this flaw is worth +4 to your power score. If
the condition is less common, like being attacked by magic, this flaw
only increases the power’s score by +2

### \<h3\>Removable Item (Flaw +2)

**Effect:** If your power is built into an item that can be disarmed or
stolen. Increase the power score by +2

*\<side bar\>*

*A word on tech in a post-apocalyptic world.  *
**All technology** suffers from *Unreliable at the best of times:* At
any time, once per scene, the Editor-in-Chief may decide that a piece of
your tech or an external power source just fails to work. This may be
applied only to a single power. You may use a Plot Point to negate this
result.  
*\</side bar\>*

### \<h3\>Roulette Power (Flaw +2/+4) 

**Restriction:** It may not be used with continuous powers. It may not
be combined with Exclusive Power. At least two of your powers must both
have this flaw.

**Effect:** Two or more of your powers are combined, and you never know
which one will be used. When you seek to use one of your powers with
this flaw, roll randomly to determine which power is actually used. If
all powers linked to this flaw are used for the same purpose (for
instance, all powers that deal damage), this is a +2 flaw. If the powers
are more disparate (such as Chameleon, Elemental/Energy Blast, and
Summon Animal), this is a +4 flaw.

### \<h3\>Secondary Effect (Perk -2/-4)

**Effect:** One of your powers possesses a useful additional effect.
Choose one of the following conditions: once per scene, you may apply
this additional effect to your power by spending a bonus action to
“power up.”

When you use this perk you must not only successfully hit the target
with your power’s primary attack, but you must also surpass the
secondary effect’s stated defense for the secondary effect to apply. If
you fail to defeat this secondary defense, you still apply your power’s
primary effects.

</table>

*Blinded* and *Frightened:* Targets affected suffer these secondary
effects for a number of turns equal to the power’s score modifier +1.
Targets affected get either a constitution or wisdom saving throw at the
end of their turn (chosen when applying this power modification) to end
this effect.

*Crippled, Deafened, Exhausted,* and *Shaken:* These secondary effects
remain in effect until the end of the scene.

### \<h3\>Seeking (Perk -2) 

**Effect:** Your control over your power is so fine you can seek out
your intended target. Thus, you ignore any penalties for Cover and don’t
suffer a -3 penalty when attacking a target that is currently engaged in
melee with another creature; you are still required to see the target
and possess a line of effect to the target. This Perk can only be
applied to Ranged powers.

### \<h3\>Synergy (Perk -2)

**Requirement:** This power modification requires that powers
specifically possess the special (synergy) feature, allowing them to
synergize with other listed powers.

**Effect:** Choose one of the powers combined through this power
modification to be the group's primary power; any time you increase that
power score, the score of all other synergized powers is increased by
the same amount. You cannot increase the scores of the other powers
directly, only through increasing the score of the group's primary
power.

### \<h3\>Slow (Flaw +2/+4)

**Effect:** You may only apply this modifier to power that requires a
Bonus Action or an Action to use. If you apply this flaw to a power that
requires a bonus action, that power will now require an action, and that
power’s score will be increased by +2. If this flaw is applied to a
power that requires an action, that power will now require a demanding
action, and that power’s score will be increased by +4.

### \<h3\>Static (Flaw +2/+4)

**Effect:** Any power with this Flaw may *never* be improved under *any*
circumstances... ever. The power has reached its full potential. This
Flaw may only be acquired during Hero creation and may not be combined
with any other Power Modification Flaw (Flaws required by your Power
Source still apply). If this Flaw is applied to the Life Support power,
the power is increased by an additional +2 (for a total of +4).

### \<h3\>Spell Power Infusion (Perk -2) 

**Requirement:** This can only be applied to powers with the magical
spell flaw.

**Effect:** When casting the spell this perk is assigned to you, you may
incur additional burnout, which temporarily increases the power’s score.
Doing so requires the expenditure of a plot point; by increasing the
power’s Burnout by 3 points, you increase the power’s score by +2 to a
maximum number of additional points equal to your wisdom score.
Regardless, you may never incur more Burnout than your remaining
Burnout.

### \<h3\>Spirit Seeker (Perk -2/-4) 

**Effect:** Your power can affect those on a different plane of
existence at full strength, such as those under the effect of the Free
Consciousness or Incorporeal powers. This perk is -2 for Mental powers
and -4 for all other powers. This allows powers such as Entangle to be
used on Incorporeal characters. You still must be able to target a
creature to affect them.

### \<H3\>Sustained Damage (Perk -4) 

**Effect:** Any power with this Perk affects the target over and over -
without needing a new Attack Roll. On a successful hit, the target takes
the initial damage as normal. At the end of their next turn, they start
to suffer your power score modifier in the same damage type for a number
of turns equal to half your power score modifier, after which the target
gets a Constitution saving throw to end this effect. Additional hits do
not add to this continuous damage; instead, reset its duration.

### \<h3\>Techno-Limited (Flaw +2) 

**Restriction:** Must be used with a power that normally affects living
creatures or other organic material.

**Effect:** This power only affects technology. It has no effect on
organic material or living (or formerly living) creatures. If this power
is a mental power, it only affects artificial intelligence.

### \<h3\>Temporary power (Flaw +2)

**Effect:** You can only apply this flaw to any continuous powers that
do not require a reaction to use. The power now is activated as an
Action, has a Burnout cost of 5, and only remains active for a number of
turns equal to your power score modifier.

### \<h3\>Trigger (Flaw +4)

**Effect:** Your power requires an emotional trigger for you to access
it. You determine the emotion with your Editor-in-Chief; once set, you
may only use the power whenever you feel this emotion or you
successfully make a Routine (DC: 15) wisdom saving throw. If you
succeed, you have access to your power for the rest of the scene. If you
fail the roll, you may not access this power for the rest of the scene.

Powers such as Mind Control can affect your emotional state, allowing
someone to effectively shut down your power before the end of the scene
by changing your emotional state.

**Special (Spells):** If this flaw is applied to a power with the spell
power modification, which also has the Trigger Flaw, you may utilize an
Occult skill check in place of a wisdom saving throw.

### \<h3\>Unpowered Form (Flaw +2)

**Effect:** Not only are your powers not on all the time, but you don’t
have access to them until you transform (either by saying magic words,
changing your physical form, or only being available when another power
is in use) as a Demanding action. When you transform, you may choose to
activate any of your powers with the scene descriptor as part of the
same action, paying its burnout cost, of course. You may only remain in
your empowered form a number of hours per day equal to your constitution
score; these hours need not be consecutive.

### \<h3\>Unreliable (Flaw +4)

**Effect:** Your power doesn’t always work. Whenever you use your power,
there is a 50% chance the power simply does not work. When it does so,
you use your action but pay zero burnout for the failed attempt.
