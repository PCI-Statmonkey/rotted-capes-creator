# The Archive

What would a zombie game… wait… a zombie game with superpowers, magic, and weird science be without super zombies, abominations, wild animals, and one of the most dangerous threats…other survivors who want to take what’s yours. Below, we will delve into the various types of threats you can throw at your heroes.  
  
You may notice that many of the threats found in the following pages have a budget that is either more or less than their build budget. That’s fine; if you are creating your threats, don’t feel straitjacketed by your build budget, but don’t go overboard. It's all a balancing act.

## Types of Threats post Z’day 

**Animals:**

During the collapse, animal rights activists, led by a superpowered group known as the Wyld Pack, broke into every zoo, lab, and nature preserve they could find, releasing the animals within. Now, years later, these animals have flourished, using their heightened senses to avoid roaming zombie hordes. A lion pride living in the suburbs, packs of wild dogs roam cities, while a troop of silverback apes settle into an old farm. Interestingly, no known cases of Z’d animals have appeared; however, there are reports of animal Abominations.

**Survivors: Allies & Adversaries**

There are two different categories of survivors. Bystanders are everyday people trying to cope with this new reality, but where they commonly lack combat skills, they make up for it with the will to live. Then we have hardened survivors, many are ex-military or law enforcement or bystanders that over time have improved their skills and sharpened their instincts.

**  
Abominations:** 

Mutants were a thing before Z’day, but always the result of gen-splicing experimentation by villains, disreputable organizations, and governments. With very few exceptions, these mutants were a lot like the monstrosities we see today. Today, they are much more common; these unfortunate unpowered individuals seem to harbor a particular recessive Ultra-Gene that, once infected, protects them from the Z-virus but forces them to undergo dramatic physical and biochemical changes that break their minds, making them more beast than human. While most abominations come from mutated humans, there are reports of Animals becoming abominations. There is a huge 15-foot-tall Silverback Abomination, Designation: Silver Kong, that seems to eat zombies if you can believe it. That thing has been causing havoc along the southern coast.

Horrors, on the other hand, are creatures summoned from other dimensions, demons, and other eldritch beings. Sometimes it seems Lovecraft was a little more on the nose than we all would like to believe.

**Powered Individuals:**

And now we come to superheroes and supervillains. But nowadays, does it really matter anymore? As long as they are standing between us and the Z’s, it's all that matters. This covers all the classic origins you know, like that kid from an alien world here to save us, and what good did that do us? She was probably Z’d too, for all we know, no, we would know if she was Z’d, right?

**Robots & Other Tech Threats:**

Some Robots pose a serious threat among the ruins due to their original programming—which was intended to serve—having been corrupted into a relentless quest to wipe out any signs of life, no longer able to distinguish between the living and the dead. These artificial foes present a distinct challenge, ranging from automated sentry drones armed with lethal precision to faulty repair bots roving old superhero headquarters, wreaking inadvertent chaos.

**Zombies:**

Dead heads, Z’s, you all know what these are, the ravenous dead right out of Night of the Living Dead and other Zombie flicks. But I guess just normal zombies is just not good enough we have to deal with wired zombies right out of some crazy horror book. How some of these come to be, can be a bit complicated, there has been some chatter about some of these zombies being a version of abomination where the victims recessive Ultra-Gene fails to save them from becoming a zombie but does not quite activate their regressive powers, other wired zombies are the results of some twisted doctors experimentation, or a failed attempt to get rid of them. Regardless not all Z’s are the same.

**Super Z's:**

The epitome of horror, super zombies combine the relentless hunger of their lesser brethren with heightened intelligence and superpowers. These are THE apex predators. Luckily, they are also VERY territorial and almost never work together. Facing a Super Z should never be taken lightly. Only those with inborn powers can become Super Z’s, but that’s not to say that these horrific adversaries are not capable of using technology, they most certainly are.

## Animals 

Here are a few animal stats blocks. This is in no way an exhaustive list; feel free to modify these stat blocks to create or create your own animals.

## Survivors: Allies & Adversaries 

One of the greatest threats to an enclave often comes in the form of other survivors. Below, we provide some general threat blocks that you can tweak as needed, changing skills and equipment on the fly as you see fit.

### Bystanders 

These are your regular, run-of-the-mill survivors. Alone, they are not much of a threat, but they can be dangerous in large groups. Bystanders commonly possess a range of skill sets, with some individuals having specialized skill sets, such as a professional engineer or doctor.

Here are some examples of common skill sets among common survivors:

- **Caretaker** (basic first aid, childcare, community support)

- **Teacher** (history, critical thinking, organizing people)

- **Handyman** (simple repair, tool use, fix-it knowledge)

- **Cook** (meal planning, food preservation, basic chemistry)

- **Custodian** (scavenging, cleaning chemicals, building familiarity)

- **Retail Worker** (bartering, crowd management, survival in chaos)

- **Farmhand** (animal handling, gardening, weather sense)

- **Librarian** (research, knowledge of obscure topics, filing systems)

- **Bus Driver** (vehicle familiarity, basic navigation)

- **Janitor** (lock keys, maintenance shortcuts, problem-solving)

- **Parent** (emotional support, multitasking, comfort)

- **Veteran** *(but not Special Forces)* (basic first aid, discipline, simple tactics, firearms safety)

### Hardened Survivors

Especially capable bystanders, hardened threats could be capable military personnel or raiders who travel from enclave to enclave, taking what they want and killing others. A rugged survivalist who goes it alone, spreading news from enclave to enclave, sometimes acting as a loose group of letter carriers. Or a survivor with an especially useful and sought-after skill set.

## Abominations 

### Silver Kong

Silver Kong was once a majestic creature, a giant silverback gorilla residing in the Miami zoo, the head of one of the largest pods kept in captivity. In the wake of the Z-Day outbreak, a horde of zombies invaded the Miami zoo, overwhelming its defenses and claiming the lives of its entire gorilla pod. Silver Kong, too, fell victim to the horde, but instead of dying, he was turned into something more.

Instead, he was transformed. From his massive frame, he grew even larger, towering at an astounding 15 feet tall. The once-majestic silverback had become an Abomination, a twisted amalgamation of his former self.

Now, Silver Kong roams the desolate remnants of the Miami zoo, a colossal and fearsome figure. Striking fear into the hearts of those who dare to cross his path. Survivors who encounter Silver Kong tremble at the sight of his immense stature, his bestial visage. He has become a living legend.

### The Butcher of Paradigm City

A moniker that has struck fear into the hearts of survivors amid the shattered remnants of Paradigm City: The Butcher. He had evolved from a bystander into a monstrosity of unfathomable horror. His body is bloated and scarred, covered in open sores that leaked a foul stink, and he stands at a ridiculous height of 10 feet. His sickly pale skin appears to be strained to its breaking point, ready to rupture at any moment. He holds a big cleaver in his gigantic grip, a primitive weapon fashioned from jagged scrap metal.

The Butcher's ravenous hunger drives him to pursue and devour survivors, reveling in the gruesome feast of human flesh. Interestingly, zombies appear to be utterly uninterested in consuming him.

### The Maw

*“The ground cracked and then… it was just teeth. Everywhere. We lost Carter in seconds.”*

The Maw is not something you can reason with or even understand. It is older than the Z-virus, older perhaps than humanity’s memory of the earth itself. A thing that burrows through flesh and stone alike, it waits beneath the streets and ruins, patient as time, until it decides to feed.

What it truly is, no one can say. A weapon buried and forgotten? A fragment of some deeper, more malevolent intelligence? Or simply a hunger given shape? Whatever it was, it was not born of a mother or grown in a lab; it was always here.

The Maw does not hunt for sport, or revenge, or even need. It devours because it must, tearing through everything, even the undead, leaving only silence and a few flecks of bone to mark where you stood.

You don’t see the Maw coming. You hear the earth split… and pray it isn’t under you.

<p><strong>Bonus Action</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swallow Whole:</strong> The maw can force a medium or smaller creature that it is grappling to make a (DC 16) Strength or Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed, and the grapple ends.

The Maw can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the Maw dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse. Damage delt from within the maw bypass all DR</p></th>

### Zombie: Common “Deadhead”

*Now this is the common zombie… You know the type, just lumbering around looking for something to eat, or lying there waiting for some poor sod to walk by looking like lunch.  *
  
Deadheads are the most common and least remarkable of the infected; that is, as if anything about the end of the world can be called “common.” Alone, a Deadhead is almost pitiable: a hollow-eyed corpse that stumbles, groans, and lungs with little coordination. But they are never truly alone. One groan becomes two, then ten, then a horde of snapping jaws and grasping fingers that can pull down even the strongest hero if given the chance. Underestimate them, and you’ll join them.

### Zombie: Cleaver

*"You can hear them before you see them… bone scraping concrete. Then they’re on you, hacking and hacking, like they’ll never stop."*

Cleavers are what happens when the virus decides sharp is better than blunt. Their hands have warped into long, jagged blades of fused bone, their fingers stripped away entirely. They don’t grab, they don’t claw, they cut. Survivors have been found in pieces; their bodies roughly carved up. Cleavers aren’t any smarter than Deadheads, but they’re faster, meaner, and hack everything to bits, feasting on what remains.

### Zombie: Ninja’Z

*No you noob! Ninja’z are not like black pajama warring zombies with swords! Ugh, it’s called a metaphor! Now, as I was saying, some zombies are sneaky, VERY sneaky, and way smarter than they have any business being.*

Among the most feared of the strange infected, Ninja’Z are proof that some part of what they once were remains. They are quiet, deliberate, and terrifyingly quick. Always in groups of two to four, they stalk the edges of survivor enclaves, watching and waiting for their moment to strike. Where Deadheads mindlessly charge, Ninja’Z strike from behind, cut off escape, and leave no trace but a smear of blood and an empty space where your teammate used to be.

### Zombie: Phasers 

*"Barricades don’t matter to them. Doors. Walls. Steel. None of it matters. They’re already inside."*

Various eggheads believe they are the result of some failed attempt by a Super-Brain’s attempt to send them to another dimension. Regardless, these eerie figures drift through walls and barricades as though they were smoke, emerging just close enough to tear into the living before vanishing again. They don’t seem to understand the laws of the physical world anymore, and worse, they don’t care. No fortress is truly safe if a Phaser is hunting you.

### Zombie: Twitchers

*"Don’t watch them too long. You’ll lose track of where the next one’s coming from."*

Twitchers are what happens when the virus burns through a body faster than it can settle. Their nerves misfire constantly, causing them to jerk, lunge, and convulse in unnatural ways. They move in fits and start, one moment still as a corpse, the next tearing across a room with impossible speed. Even experienced survivors struggle to track them in combat, and more than one has swung at empty air only to feel claws sink in from the side.

## Super Z’s

# The Anatomy of a Super-Zombie

## Personal Log of Milos Gojkovic; 203rd Year of Life:

*It appears that despite protestations to the contrary by these so-called “Super-Heroes”, it was indeed providence that granted me the knowledge to extend my life beyond the norm. For the riddle of why those imbued with abilities far beyond those of mortal men are able to retain a semblance of their intellect, while normal men are raised from the dead with little more than the cognitive ability to recognize a food source and feed upon it, is one which only someone of my soaring intellect could possibly answer.*

*I am convinced that virus that animates the dead somehow recombines differently with the mutated DNA of these Homo-Superiors; that much is obvious even to the muscle-bound Titan. The question is ‘Why”? Why does this particular virus seem to bind itself into a symbiotic relationship with their genetic makeup, while acting as a ravenous parasite on the rest of our species?*

*To answer that, I will need to acquire that new electron microscope that Dr. Denton had developed before the coming of Z-Day. With the limited power available for my cyborgs however, I hope they are up to the task of distracting the now-predatory Denton Dynasty while I liberate the device.*

*While the danger is high, the chance to finally uncover the mystery behind the ruination of humanity and perhaps discover a way to reverse it is well worth any risks.*

## The Psychology of a Super Zombie

While most of the Risen Dead have the cognitive ability of a lower-class animal species, able to identify food and devour it, those who manifested some “super-power” or ability prior to being infected and reanimated manage to retain a high level of intellect, albeit without the capacity to tell between right and wrong or even empathize with their victims.

The reason for this remains unknown at this time and may never be revealed. What is known is that the Super-Zombie, regardless of the retention of a measure of their intellect, is known to behave in certain patterns that may save the life of the Living if they are aware and able to act upon this information.

### Cunning and Resourcefulness

*“Torch?” said Stonehenge into his mike, “I have a pack of Z’s shambling up to the west gate. Engaging to disperse.”*

*“Negative, Stonehenge”, came the staticy voice of the Liberty Torch, “Wait for back up. I can have Power House and Arc Lightning at your 20 in ten minutes.”*

*“They’re just a bunch of Z’s, Torch,” replied Stonehenge as pieces of asphalt and stone flew to him and began shaping itself into his trade mark rocky armor. “Nothing I can’t handle.”*

*Muting his ear piece so as not to hear the Torch’s maternal warnings, Stonehenge leapt over the barricade and jogged towards the shambling group. The Torch meant well, but with each loss, she became more and more overprotective – smotheringly so.*

*Besides, there was no better way for blowing off steam than wading into a bunch of mindless Z’s that couldn’t crack his rocky shell. His sledgehammer sized fists smashed into the first few of the Undead; pulping their rotting heads like over ripe melons. With each Z that he took down, layers of black effluvia that had the consistency of molasses stained his stony fists.*

*That’s when Stonehenge made a fatal error - fighting against creatures that have no hope of hurting you makes one complacent; your mind tends to wander while your body goes on auto-pilot. Thoughts began to pop into his head: that was the problem with Paradigm City’s most abundant residents – to paraphrase that old chips commercial – smash all you want; there’s so many more. He wondered how many they would need to destroy - you can’t really kill the dead – until they could start to rebuild civilization; maybe have some sort of normal life again.*

*Seven kills into the fight, his attention was brought back to the scene of carnage by a sepulchral voice dripping with malice. “That doesn’t seem fair – you seem to be having all the fun while they can’t even scratch your hide. Here – let’s even things up!”*

*‘Z’s can’t talk’, was the first thing to cross his mind as his attention snapped back to the present. Then pain – searing pain - more terrible than any he had felt in a very long time erupted across his left arm. Blinking the tears out of his eyes he saw the Wrecker shrugging off an old moldering coat as he held the stony carapace that once protected the Hero’s arm. Raw pieces of bloody muscle tissue were still affixed to the armor, leaking bright red.*

*Ripping a gobbet of meat from the inside of the rocky shell, like a man eating a succulent lobster, the Wrecker smiled as he smeared red across his rotting lips, “Mmmm…see I thought that with all that weight lifting you’d be tough as jerky, but nope…you’re as tender and juicy as that teenager I feasted on last week.*

*“Now come on…don’t make us all wait for dinner!”*

*As Stonehenge felt himself being ripped apart and shock starting to set in, his mind rebelled against what had just happened. He forgot that while Z’s don’t plan ambushes, Z’d Supers do. The Wrecker had hid in plain sight, waiting for some idiot to come along, get overconfident and plow into a mob of Z’s like he was playing a video game in God-mode.*

*Too bad it was a lesson that Stonehenge learned too late.*

Unlike their unpowered counterparts, the Super Zombie has been able to retain its intellect, though its thoughts and actions are always colored by barely restrained rage and an almost overpowering hunger.

To be clear, a Super Zombie will never be found contemplating its existence in a philosophical reverie, no matter how sated it may be. Its ability to plan and formulate strategy is akin to a wild animal’s cunning, but elevated to the level of a human’s cognitive ability. Thus, while “normal” zombies react to stimuli, usually in the form of a living food source, the Super Zombie is able to plan ambushes, use shortcuts to head off potential victims, or lay elaborate traps to capture their food. Additionally, the Super-Zombie can be patient if it reasons that there is a greater chance of success if it bides its time rather than attack in an explosion of savage fury.

Sitting at the top of the world’s new food chain, the Super-Zombies are the ultimate predators with mankind (Homo sapiens and superior alike) having been knocked from the top perch and finding themselves the hunted.

### Appealing to their Better Angels

*The Grit lamp pole tightened across her chest with every breath becoming harder to make. She looked into the eyes of the man that she had idolized for so many years and finally married just months before Z-Day.*

*They said it was a waste of time to appeal to them; to beg for mercy – but this was the Grit Master, Frank Eisen, the kindest man she had ever known. And if anyone could reach him, it was her; after all, didn’t he confess that he had never loved anyone as much as he did her?*

*“Frank – please…look at me! This is Betty – your ‘Bets’. You have to stop, my love. You’re hurting me! Remember the times we had together – our wedding where you tripped on the way out of the church and we spilled down the stairs. And our honeymoon, Frank – remember what a magical time we had in Italy together!*

*“Please stop Frank – you’re killing me!”*

*“Oh stop fussing, Bets! I’m not going to kill you?”  
“You’re not,” Betty Eisen asked, her voice cracking with hope?*

*“Of course not, darling. I prefer my meat fresh. And I’m sure I can keep you breathing for days, so I can enjoy you piece by piece!”*

During the first few weeks of the global phenomenon known as Z-Day, the Heroes who had so gallantly defended the Earth and humanity began to fall one by one. While the surviving populace mourned their loss, they began to watch in horror as their once dedicated defenders turned into amplified versions of the Risen Dead that now stalked them.

At first, discovering that their champions were not mindless death machines gave the people hope – hope that these ‘Z’d’ Super Heroes could be reasoned with; that some spark of their humanity still existed in their stilled hearts. Those hopes were soon dashed when the men and women who had sacrificed so much to protect them, laughed mercilessly as they descended upon them in a feeding frenzy!

Some of the brightest medical scientists left theorized that the virus reanimating the dead Supers has somehow scrubbed away their ability to tell right from wrong or from developing any sort of empathic bond with any living (or unliving, for that matter) being. Though able to reason, interact and even form strange and bizarre communities amongst themselves, the Z’d Heroes no longer had the ability to connect with their former fellows or even loved ones. If asked by a clinician to label such behavior, these Z’d Heroes’ behavior might be construed as sociopathic, given their amoral and self-serving nature. Yet when one couples it with their animalistic aggression and savage nature, their behavior would quickly be characterized as psychopathic.

Imagine a serial killer with powers and abilities beyond the ken of mortal man; truly a nightmarish scenario!

## The Ultra Z’d and its Territorial Nature

\<\<INSERT ART – Z’d Titan vs Z’d Judgment\>\>

*Balor was sure that the car tumbling just over his head was the new Beamer that he had wanted so badly. At least he had before all hell had – literally – broken loose. He winced as it crashed through a glass window and its front end crumpled. Even German engineering couldn’t build a car that could withstand the pummeling of a Z’d Super.*

*“Why are we running,” huffed Power House? “I say we stand and fight! I think he’s overrated. We can take ‘im!”*

*“I fought alongside Titan, when he and Nuada used to team up back in the day,” Balor said as he sprinted down the cluttered and debris strewn side walk. “Believe me, laddie – we couldn’t take him on his worst day!”*

*Another bellow, made mostly inarticulate from the rage that blinded Titan. The team had snuck into the Ultra hero’s lair and managed to free Templar before he (it?) could dine on her. Unfortunately, they were too late for the other poor innocents that had been captured alongside her.*

*In his usual manic manner, Velocity zipped around the group of heroes as they made their way deeper into the financial district. “Comeoncomeoncomeon…. he’sgettingreallyclose!” A pause, which for Velocity must have been the equivalent of a lengthy moment of consideration, then, “Whyarewegoingthisway? Nonono..thiswasabadidea!”*

*The rest of the team gave Balor an anxious look as they made their way into the Financial District of Paradigm City. They’d been playing a game of cat and mouse with Titan, but the transformed super hero was getting closer with every passing minute, not to mentioned more enraged, while they were getting tired and nowhere near any known sanctuaries or enclaves.*

*“Just get across this next street and get ready!” the former sidekick of Nuada, leader of the legendary Irish super hero team, the Tuatha De’ Danann ordered. Weaving through the obstacle course of abandoned Mercedes Benz, town cars and the occasional limo, the weary group found shelter in the marbled entrance to a prominent investment bank building.*

*Just across the way, bounding down the avenue on its powerful legs, came the juggernaut known as Titan! It still hadn’t caught sight of them, but the team knew it was just a matter of time.*

*“Now what?”, exclaimed Power House between gulps of air.*

*“Now, we hope that the intel the Night Lord gave us was right.” With a short muttered prayer to all the saints that ever were, Balor let loose his trademark laser vision in one concentrated blast. Ruby red twin beams of coruscating energy sliced into the building across the way; stone and steel melted under his baleful gaze and a few tons of rubble tumbled to the ground, releasing a gigantic plume of dust into the sky.*

*“You idiot!” screamed Power House. “You just killed us all!”*

*And right on cue, the ravaged form of Titan landed just feet from the huddled heroes.*

*“That was stupid, kid!” laughed Titan. “I never did like you Balor. You were just a little snot nosed kid that Nuada let hang around. I thought you were a pain back then and my opinion hasn’t changed. Except that you’ve grown a lot dumber. That wasn’t even close to where I was. If that was a trap, you sprung it way too soon, boyo!”*

*His eyes still smoldering from the titanic release of power, Balor looked up and over Titan’s shoulder. “That wasn’t meant for you, loud mouth!”, he said nodding to something behind the Z’d super.*

*Before he could turn to see what Balor was talking about, Titan was slammed into the street by a flashing blur of red and gold. Standing above the shaken super was another Z’d super, this one a former arch villain that had plagued Paradigm City for years: the self-proclaimed champion of the proletariat, the Judgment of the People or Judgment for short.*

*The premier defender of the fallen Soviet Union, Judgment would have been awe inspiring in his red and gold spandex uniform, his crimson cape and his trademark hammer and sickle held in its powerful arms, were it not for the grey tinged skin and a rictus smile fixed permanently on his face where some other super had ripped a portion of his mouth off.*

*“You should know better than to intrude upon my territory, comrade,” the sibilant voice of the new comer stated calmly. “Now it is time for you to face your final Judgment!” And with that, the two Ultra Z’s engaged in battle.*

*“Nowwhat?, buzzed Velocity?*

*“Now,” said Balor, “we run!”  *

One interesting characteristic that has been noted by the surviving heroes is that Z’d supers appear to be extremely territorial, to the point that they will fight one another should the invading party not withdraw immediately. This characteristic may be due to the underlying aggression that seems to drive these reanimated beings.

The late and lamented Beast Master, an imminent naturalist, postulated that Z’d Supers demonstrated all the behavioral traits of top predators in the wild. Beast Master further characterized their behavior as one where the strongest of the Z’d was compelled to prove their position as an Ultra being by killing or driving off all comers or in some cases, allowing the weaker Z’d to submit to them, once again demonstrating dominance.

While most animals exhibit such behavior, it is usually due to their drive to mate and procreate. Given that Z’d Supers are in a mixed state of consciousness and death, mating, one hopes, is not the compelling drive at work here.

So what makes a Z’d Super act in the manner that it does? The answer appears to be food. These infected Supers have taken the vice of gluttony to all new levels; gorging themselves on the flesh of their victims, even past the point of satiation, and stopping only when their stomachs are so full and distended that there is the possibility of damage to their digestive system.

And herein lies the possible answer to the Z’d Super’s volatile anger – with both the normal Risen Dead and the Z’d unable to digest dead or rotting meat, they have no choice but to battle over the dwindling food sources left; namely the living.

It is this overriding motivation that compels the Risen and the Z’d to act as they do – from their seething rage to the establishment of dominance among their fellow dead. But not all Z’d Supers act solo; some have actually banded together and formed a social structure similar in nature to packs, even down to a sophisticated pecking order that makes for a stable social order.

As to why some of the Z’d prefer to remain solitary predators rather than team up with others of their kind is something that we may never know, but should be ever grateful for.

### Wolf Pack Social Structure

*The Constrictor and Arsenal sloughed through the stagnant and fetid labyrinth that were the sewers of Paradigm City in search of a former petty super-villain whose only power was to turn herself into a two-dimensional state, earning her the sobriquet of the Paper-Thin Thief. Being one of the first Z’d supers, she was a menace that would have bordered on the comical if it weren’t for the fact that she’d devoured three members of the enclave.*

*Former enemies before Z-Day, Arsenal and Constrictor were tasked with bringing in the absurd killer before she struck again. Just their luck that she had a tendency of making her hide out down in the sewers.*

*Shining their flashlights about in a large reservoir dome, Constrictor saw the petty thief trying to hide herself like an ancient drawing in an Egyptian tomb. “Alright PT, this ends here. Why not make this easy for us and we’ll make sure we give you a clean and quick death.”*

*Arsenal shook his head, trying his best not to breathe in the foul air when he spoke. “She’s already dead, fool! Let’s just take her out quick. She’s no match for the two of us!”*

*Peeling herself from the wall, an ashen grey face that would once have been called beautiful smiled back at them. “You boys are right. Little bitty me has no chance against two big strong Super Heroes like you.*

*“That’s why I brought a little help.”*

*The Constrictor’s blood ran cold as over a half-dozen heads of Z’d Supers rose up out of the putrid waters, surrounding them.*

*Their screams echoed through the sewer tunnels long after they had stopped.*

There was a time, not so long ago, when the sight of a Superhero Team flying across the sky, such as Paradigm City’s own Protectors, would bring a smile to everyone’s face and a feeling of wellbeing. But no longer.

In this Grave New World, the very glimpse of one Z’d Super is enough to fill one with dread; the sight of a group of them will make the most courageous of men shake in abject terror!

While an Ultra Z’d Hero will not tolerate another Ultra Z’d Hero poaching on its territory, some will allow other, less powerful beings to group or ally with it, forming a predatory pack structure or hierarchy. Even these reanimated beings understand that there will always be opponents bigger or stronger than it can’t possibly handle alone, thus necessitating allies that do not pose a threat to their position within the pack, but are still a benefit to it and the group as a whole.

As mentioned, these groups of Z’d Supers tend to form a social structure similar to that of wolves. They will be led by an Ultra-Z, not necessarily a true Ultra, but the strongest member of the group.

The other members of the pack will naturally line up behind the Ultra, strongest to weakest. The Ultra usually keeps a wary eye on not only the Z who follows immediately behind him, but on any who dare challenge it for dominance of the group.

For some Z’s, it’s in their nature to challenge those who claim to be the strongest for the leadership position. When confronted, most Ultras will tear the contender to shreds, though some have taken perverse pleasure in maiming their opponent to the point that they now occupy the lowest rung of the pecking order.

Some living survivors have observed that the Ultra of a group of Z’s tends to get the choicest pieces of meat and eats first. Should there be only one victim to satiate their endless hunger, then the others must wait until the Ultra has had its fill before slavering over the remains.

Some scientists speculate that there must be a fragment of a memory of their time grouped with others of their ilk, forming famed Super Hero (and Super Villain) teams. Could it be that some part of their psyche longs for companionship or camaraderie? For all of their savagery, there is still something human within them and human beings are, by nature, social beings.

Perhaps this new form of (un)life is still evolving and mutating into another stage; something that can be reasoned with or live in peaceful coexistence with sometime in the future? Some warn us that such speculations and hopes are doomed from the start. Even if these creatures signify some new version of man, humanity’s history with a sub-species should give us an insight on the ultimate result. Once there were as many as three different types of humans roaming the earth simultaneously; within a few centuries there was only one.

For all our beliefs that we have advanced as a species, humans are a jealous lot and now we face a new species that is superior to the majority of the living humans left. The past doesn’t paint a very hopeful end for us.

### Lair

*Gregory Austin awoke groggily and discovered that the incessant hum wasn’t just the ringing of his ears, but a cage of energy he appeared to be imprisoned within. Even gassed or drugged or whatever they did to him, a mere force field wouldn’t hold the Undying Man for long. That was when he noticed the IV attached to his left arm and the fact that he couldn’t feel his left leg. Not a surprise really, given that it seemed to have been expertly amputated.*

*A raspy laugh drew his horrified attention to the hazy figure on the other side of the energy curtain. “Ah, good…you’re awake. I wasn’t sure what kind of sedative would actually work on that miraculous metabolism of yours, Gregory. Believe it or not, I actually had to use a type of nerve gas of my own design. It’s good to see that my calculations were correct once again!”*

*“Denton,” Austin wanted to scream, but in his weakened condition came out as a strangled gurgle. “Then this must be…”*

*“Good, good, my dear boy. You’re shaking off the effects of the gas already. You are quite the wonder and perhaps the ultimate solution to our problem,” said Dan Denton, also known as the Calculator, as he shambled around his laboratory looking for all the world like an absent-minded scientist, if such a being had a cranium five times as large as a normal man…and he were alive.*

*“You have no idea how hard it was for me to keep the others from devouring every last tasty morsel of you,” chuckled the Calculator mirthlessly. “Especially Sandra, my daughter. I’m sure you recall her nom’ de guerre – the Flaming Fist. Why I had to give her and Robert a choice cut just to settle them down.”*

*Looking into a powerful microscope, Denton nodded to himself and said, “Amazing. The cells in your leg are already beginning to regenerate at an accelerated rate. Why in less than a week, your leg will be fully restored.*

*“Yes indeed! You are the gift that keeps on giving!”*

*“Calculator. Dan. Listen to me. This is madness. You and the rest of the Denton Dynasty are ill,” pleaded the Undying Man. “Let me go. I know my way around the Denton Building. Do the right thing and just let me escape, my old friend. You don’t have to do this!”*

*“But of course, I do, old friend!” smiled Denton through dead eyes. “According to my calculations, the population of the living will continue to dwindle while more and more of us will continue to be ‘converted’. Even taking into account the few of us you and your rebellion will eventually destroy, the living human race will cease to exist in less than 7 years, 3 months, 13 days and 9 hours, plus or minus a 0.3% deviation.*

*“Then where will we be?”*

*Ignoring the horrific madness and the thought of someone…something eating his leg in the next room, the Undying Man focused on looking around the mad man’s laboratory and trying to figure a way out of here.*

*Oblivious to his former friend’s frantic thoughts, Dan Denton continued laying out his plan. “And that’s where you come in, Gregory. The Undying Man indeed. Calling yourself the Regeneration Man would have been more accurate! If I can figure out a way to duplicate your unique genetic structure and transfer it into the living…why we’d have an endless food supply. You’d go down in history as the savior of our new race!*

*Pressing a button that released another canister of gas into the room, the Calculator continued his explanation as consciousness seeped out of the Undying Man’s body. “Now you go to sleep now, my boy. Rest up. You and I have so much work to do!”*

Z’d supers, unlike the Risen Dead, are not always active. Whether their need to rest (if indeed it is a *need*) is a byproduct of their super powers causing their body to have a higher metabolic rate, due to a half-remembered memory of sleeping and resting, or perhaps just some deeply buried part of them that craves a bit of normalcy, the Z’d have some place to call home.

These ‘homes’ are referred to as *lairs* by most of the remaining heroes; a misnomer referring to a vampire’s lair from pre-Z-Day folk lore. These lairs have been made in as many different places as there are Z’d beings to inhabit them. If the Z’d Super enjoyed a previous base of operations or a headquarters, then they will do their best to reclaim such a place, possibly due to their familiarity with such an abode.

For example, the Denton Dynasty, a family of heroes famed for their multi-generational service to the city and the world, has owned the Denton Building since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, with some members having been born here. It is little wonder that those members of the family that were transformed during the onslaught of Z-Day immediately returned to familiar surroundings and set up shop, turning the venerable structure into a modern day house of horrors.

Thanks to the Intel provided by Night Lord in his monthly *tweets*, many of the enclaves know to avoid certain areas of the city or at least, be more cautious when entering them.

Some of the known lairs in Paradigm City include:

The once prestigious financial investment firm of Lawton and Lynch’s downtown office building has been claimed, ironically enough by the former Soviet defender Judgment. None have yet to penetrate the lair of this very powerful Z’d Ultra, but he has been seen flying in and out of the building’s top floors.

A group of at least eight (and possibly more) lower powered Z’d seem to have joined forces and prowl the sewers below the city. Individually, these former supers are no match for even one or two of the surviving heroes, but the fact that they seem to have perfected pack and ambush tactics as well as the ability to pop up just about anywhere in the city makes them a particularly dangerous group.

Other Z’d Supers take over an area that makes little sense to others, but perhaps there is a personal connection or recollection associated with the place known only to them. Case in point is the Lone Tree Mall, where the vocal menace of the Z’d Sonic Boom has taken up residence. Recently discovered by a group of scavengers that broke into the mall looking for supplies that might be of assistance to their enclave, they stumbled across this malevolent creature. Luckily heroes were sent to investigate when they failed to check in and drove off the monster. Whether it has returned to the mall or found a new place to reside is unknown at this time.

### Blackstalk 

Simon Blackwell was a Biospeleologist, a biologist who specialized in life forms that live in caves, when during an expedition to a local cave network there was a collapse of the cave floor. Injured and buried beneath tons of rubble, his last conscious thought was of a strange violet light coming nearer. Awakening, he found himself being nursed back to health by the strange subterranean people known as the Molindur. Years passed and the strange diet and medicine given to heal him began a strange metamorphosis. He developed strange and unique powers, powers that allowed him to control plants and vines to a terrible effect.

When he finally reemerged on the surface, he was less than human but more than a normal man. Taking up the mantle of savior of the Molindur people, Blackstalk, as he now called himself, led a number of attacks against the surface world, but was always defeated by various Super-Heroes.

Somehow, one of the Molindur became infected with the Z’Virus and began transforming others into the living dead, including Blackstalk. Renewed with a new sense of purpose and all-consuming hunger, he has once again invaded the surface world and has claimed Centennial Park as his domain. Setting impaled humans and super-humans about to denote his area of control, left unattended, Blackstalk and his minions could prove a threat every bit as deadly as the Z-Virus itself.

### Defender

The hero known as the Defender has the unique power of being able to construct “walls” or simple

barriers out of pure force. The composition of this “force” has eluded the world’s greatest minds. Regardless of what it is, the Defender has learned over the years how to manipulate these force walls to create armor, platforms that allow him to walk into the air, and deadly missiles.

During the collapse of civilization during Z-Day, the Defender was on the outskirts of Paradigm City, holding back the hordes of undead. While pushing his powers to their limits, the Defender proved equal to the challenge… that is, until someone blew the bridges. His subconscious must have created a force bubble around him, saving his life from the explosion, then shutting off when he lost consciousness completely.

It was unfortunate that the Defender landed near the bisected body of a zombie, which crawled to him and began to gnaw through his footwear. The Defender awoke with multiple bites on his foot as well as other unprotected areas of his skin. Within hours, he was feverish and collapsed into a coma inside an army MASH unit. When he awoke, his hunger was uncontrollable, and he slaughtered the entire base. Now he moves about the city looking for new prey and eliminating other Super Z’s that he sees as competition.

###  Dr. Wraith 

Dr. Anton Czernasky chortled quietly to himself each time he thought of the accolades Sentinel and the Mayor of Paradigm City had showered upon him. Pretending to be a crime fighter was the perfect cover for his true goal: becoming the most prolific serial killer the world had ever known. Using his pow­ers made it child’s play to carve up his victims, what the police and newspapers called “ritual killings”. Fools - they failed to see his true genius, his meticulous work in dissecting his sub­jects. He was up to 38 victims before Z-Day, and then it all became rather pointless.

Himself a victim of a zombie attack and subsequent turn­ing, Dr. Wraith now has a few new goals in mind: Pick off stragglers for food; monitor those Enclaves that have insuf­ficient food supplies for winter survival and then hunt down those that have to be kicked out for the survival of the group; research the Z-Virus and hope to come up with a cure for the existing human populations, thus assuring a food supply. Test subjects will be needed, of course… Lots of them. Thus far, he has herded together a few humans for experimentation and has been able to hold off the burning hunger within him, but how much longer he can resist is anyone’s guess.

###  Electrocity

The mutant hero Electrocity has been patrolling the streets of Paradigm City for almost a decade now. His remarkable ability to transform his body into an electrical current, as well as his complete mastery over electricity, has made him one of the City’s premier heroes as well as a well-respected ally of the Protectors.

Given his unique alternate form, Electrocity is one of the few heroes to travel into space and deal with a terrorist organization that had taken over a space defense platform and threatened to turn its weapon upon the Earth. It was in that space, on that platform, that he met the only person able to go toe to toe with him in whichever form he chose. The Lightning Master nearly killed him that day before he was able to turn the tables on him and his terrorist associates.

Unfortunately, even the Man of Lightning must sometimes rest, and when he does, he is as vulnerable as any mortal. It was while resting that he was attacked by neighbors infected with the Z-Virus and eventually turned into a Super Zombie. With his wide array of powers, Electrocity is even deadlier now that his morality has been scrubbed. While he has not been seen in the ruins of Paradigm City, it is feared that he’ll return to his home and, with no one able to stop him, turn the remaining survivors into shambling undead.

###  Flaming Fist

One of the last scions of the famed Denton Dynasty, the Flaming Fist’s powers manifested in her late teens. A beautiful young woman named Jennifer Denton began modeling as a way to offset the disappointment of not having manifested any powers like those of her famous parents. However, during a swimsuit shoot in frigid Norway, her body reacted to the cold by engulfing her in flames. Elated that she had finally inherited her birthright, young Jenny became the Flam­ing Fist, able to generate intense flames that she can form into fireballs or gouts of white-hot flames.

Always cognizant of the paparazzi due to her career, Jennifer elected for a costume that left little to the imagination and flaunted her more mature body as she grew into womanhood. Needing little actual protection due to the heat aura she constantly generated, she had little to fear from bullets or the errant energy bolt. Unfortunately, when Z-Day hit, it didn’t protect her from the bites of a zombie that hurled himself from the rooftop as she flew by.

Although she incinerated him, it was too late, and the virus had already begun to spread through her bloodstream.

That was when she discovered that her powers were to be the death of her. While cauterizing a recent wound has a very good chance of stopping the virus in its tracks, her specific powers made her flesh immune to burning. Within hours, the Flaming Fist joined the ranks of the undead.

###  Golden Ram

Always considered a large boy, Darren Lasker was born to be a bully. From getting kids’ lunch money to eventually small-time robbery, he had a rap sheet longer than some hardened criminals by the time he was fourteen. As an adult, Lasker found that his strength and endurance bordered on the super-human, and as long as he only fought normal police officers, he was right. It was when a superhero would show up that his vaunted powers paled in comparison.

After his last stint in prison, Lasker took a large part of his ill-gotten gains and gave every penny to Prof. Gojkovik, who promised to increase his power a hundredfold. The Eternal Man was true to his word, giving Lasker augmented strength as well as assuring him that once he started moving, he was an unstoppable force. He even gave Lasker a reinforced helmet to protect his head when he charged.

Calling himself the Golden Ram, he went up against the best of the best – from Sentinel to Titan and held his own. Ironically, it was Titan, his archenemy, that infected him with the Z-Virus. Who else could penetrate his nigh invulnerable skin than a man with a jaw of steel? Now a Super-Zombie, the Golden Ram’s luster has dulled a bit, but he’s no less deadly than he was in life.

###  Judgment

Heralded as the supreme hero of the Soviet Union, the Judgment of the People basked in honor and glory showered upon him by his homeland and government. This proud man, the first of the Soviet Ultras, and arguably the most powerful, led the fight for Mother Russia from Moscow to the deserts of Afghanistan and even to the very doorstep of the capitalist dogs and their superhuman puppets.

Imagine how painful it must have been for this patriot to see everything he believed in turn to dust and confronted with the paradigm that the way of life he fought and bled for was a lie. Is it any wonder why he attempted to assassinate Secretary General Gorbachev, only to be stopped by those he led - the Soviet Guard?

Disgraced and branded a traitor, Judgment was stripped of his citizenship and exiled from Mother Russia in chains. He decided to take his battle directly to those responsible for his current state – America. There, he regularly battled the likes of Sentinel and Titan, who became his most implacable foes.

He eventually became infected by the undead speedster known as the Blue Bolt and later watched with glee as everything that was America disintegrated before his dead eyes. In an ironic turn, while running amok in the heart of Paradigm City’s financial district, Judgment made his lair in the offices of one of the most prestigious brokerage firms in the world.

###  Light Master & Mirage 

Reid Thompson and Frank Addison grew up together in the city of Manchester in the United Kingdom, becoming closer than brothers as they matured from adolescence to adulthood. When the time came, they both enlisted in the British Army and were sent to fight in the Afghan War, serving with bravery and honor. It was while exploring an ancient fort in western Afghanistan that their unit stumbled across a strange artifact. The relic resembled a small egg made of an unearthly metal with a mercurial quality to it. When one of the soldiers went to unearth it fully, the relic let off a shrill scream before exploding. Of the six men in the unit, only Reid and Frank survived.

Awakening in a hospital, the two slowly recovered and were honorably discharged. It was while they were convalescing at home that the two discovered that they had somehow acquired super-human abilities. Reid was able to manifest small constructs or solid light holograms as he would later conclude, merely by imagining it in his mind.

When he approached Frank about his miraculous ability, his friend confided that he, too, was able to create things from his mind, but that they were more ethereal illusions than anything solid. When he went to demonstrate by creating an illusion of a dragon, he was astounded to discover that rather than a translucent, comical beast, this dragon looked solid, roared, and even had a distinct odor.

When Reid attempted to use his power, he found that rather than small-sized constructs that he had to concentrate on maintaining, he could now create elaborate solid holograms with the slightest of thoughts. After some experimentation, they discovered that their abilities increased exponentially when they were in close proximity to one another.

Thinking it fun, they both donned costumes and sought out crimes to thwart, but on their first outing, the reckless use of their powers caused considerable damage to nearby buildings and badly wounded several innocent bystanders. Horrified, Frank vowed never to use his powers again, while Reid took it all in stride and continued on without his partner.

When Z-Day arrived, Reid and Frank were reactivated and sent, along with every other able-bodied man, to deal with the surging tide of the dead. Infected during the first week of battle, Reid died and reanimated as a Super Zombie. Repelled by the heavy firepower of the remaining British forces, the newly Z’d Light Master knew that to survive, he’d need to have his powers amplified.

Finding his old friend, Reid ambushed and infected Frank with the Z-Virus. Within hours, wracked by horrible fever and pain, Frank died, and the Z’d version of Mirage awoke. Now, the deadly duo spread death and destruction across the world on their Flesh Tasting Tour, as Reid likes to call it.
