Plot Points

Even in a world suffering from a zombie apocalypse, Heroes are destined for greater things.

These points allow you, the player, to help shape, create, and tell your Hero's story. Not only do they allow you to alter the scene, but they also provide a way for you to have those big "dig deep" moments found in our favorite comics.

Every Hero starts each Issue with a set number of Plot Points (commonly one, unless modified by other rules or abilities). Players can earn, spend, and transfer Plot Points during play. Plot Points are reset to one at the start of each new Issue.

# \<h1\> How to use Plot Points

You may spend a Plot Point at any time, but only one Plot Point can be used on any single die roll. So, unless otherwise indicated, spending a Plot Point is not an action.

When you spend a Plot Point, it is handed over to the Editor-in-Chief, who can later use it to your advantage or detriment.   
  
Remember, you and the Editor-in-Chief are not playing at odds; we are all here to have fun and tell a good story. Trust your Editor-in-Chief. And don't worry, there are plenty of ways to earn additional Plot Points.

Editor-in-Chief, are you wondering what you can do with your plot points? See Plot Twist! on page XX in the running the game chapter.

So, what can you do with Plot Points?

-   *Alter a Scene:* You can spend a Plot Point to create an advantageous complication, altering some aspect of the scene. For Example, cause the floor of a building to give out at the right moment; find a fireman's axe when you need it the most; have a wall come down on an opponent you knocked back, giving you a few moments to run for your life; have a car explode after you blast it with fire, grab a flag pole when you are knocked off a building, and so on. Such complications should never be an "I WIN" button and are completely at the Editor-in-Chief's discretion.
-   *Negate a Triggered Flaw:*  You may spend a Plot Point to negate the result of a Flaw (not a weakness) when triggered by the Editor-in-Chief.
-   *Reroll:* You may spend Plot Point rerolling any d20 check or damage roll.
-   *Grant the Editor-in-Chief Disadvantage:* You may spend a Plot Point to grant an attacker a Disadvantage on their Attack against you.
-   *Help an ally Escape Death:* When an ally is reduced to 0 wounds and 0 stamina, you may spend a Plot Point to help an ally escape death; they retain 1 wound but are *Unconscious.*
-   *Wound Recovery:* You may spend a Plot Point to ignore the result of a failed Wound Recovery Roll; the Hero's condition remains unchanged until the following day.
-   *Aid another:* You may spend one of your Plot Points to aid another, allowing them to spend that Plot Point as if it were theirs, but you can only grant one Plot Point per scene.
-   *Endure:* You may use plot points to mitigate the effects of diseases, wounds, overcome Exhaustion, or buy extra time in resource management crises, as later at the end of this chapter (Survival)
-   *Influence Events:* Between Issues, you may use plot points to influence events in your enclave (see chapter XX: The Living Enclave)
-   *Break the Rules:* You may, at the Editor-in-Chief's discretion, break the rules â€“ in effect, do the impossible. Doing so may require several Plot Points and even a skill or power check.

A Final Note: Plot Points are meant to embody the rule of cool; use them creatively, create moments, and tell a good story. Don't hoard them, spend them when it counts!

**\<h3\> Editor's Notes: Altering Scenes**  
The player should describe their desired change or addition to the scene, ensuring it is reasonable and fits within the established game world. The Editor-in-Chief will evaluate the proposal, considering the impact on the story, game balance, and the enjoyment of all players. If approved, the scene is adjusted accordingly, reflecting the player's creative input.

Let the players use plot points to help you tell the story, such as when a player recalls how to access a maintenance tunnel under a mall where he used to work before Z-day. Oh, and one of your players uses a plot point to remember some interesting fact about a Z-rated hero, giving him a psychological edge.

\</sidebar\>

# \<h1\> Earning Plot Points

You start every Issue with one Plot Point, but there are a few ways to gain more plot points through play. When you get them, don't hoard them, as your Plot Points reset to one at the beginning of every Issue.

*Personality Flaws.*

If you emphasize one of your flaws **to your own detriment**, the Editor-in-Chief may reward you with a Plot Point. In this scenario, gaining an advantage from your flaw is strictly prohibited. The Editor can limit the number of Plot Points you receive if they believe you are exploiting flaws.

Furthermore, once per scene, one of your flaws can be activated by either the Editor-in-Chief or other players. If you embrace the consequences and play through your flaw's activation, you earn a Plot Point. However, it's important to note that you are always within your rights to decline the activation of your flaw, facing no negative repercussions.

Upon activation, you suggest how your flaw manifests in the game, which the Editor-in-Chief can accept or even enhance. The effects of a flaw might span from statistical detriments to specifically required actions. Remember, your flaw should not grant you any advantage; it's a flaw**,** after all.

*Suggesting Complications*

Another way a player can gain a Plot Point is by suggesting detrimental complications to the editor-in-chief. For Example, the players can suggest that the terrified bystanders start to fire wildly into a melee with pistols, suggest that zombies show up at inopportune times, or even suggest that their Heroes' powers burn out unexpectedly.

Suggesting complications should be done in the spirit of creating a good story, not to power the game or max out possible Plot Point gain. Of course, the Editor-in-Chief has the last word on the event and is free to modify it as they see fit.

*Tagline*

If you deliver your tagline at just the right moment, enhancing the scene with perfect timing or in an epic way, the Editor-in-Chief may reward you with a Plot Point. It's not just about saying the line; it's about nailing the delivery when it counts.

*Editor's Discretion*

Finally, a player may be awarded a Plot Point at any time during an adventure at the Editor-in-Chief's discretion. These points can be awarded to reward heroic actions, excellent role-playing, or even helpful actions by the player out of character (such as driving out of his way to pick up another player to bring them to the game).

In short, Plot Point rewards should encourage players to help create a more enjoyable game for all parties involved.

\<SIDE BAR\>

Editor's Notes: Communicating Complications   
Players who want to suggest a complication should pass notes to the editor-in-chief. If two or more players come up with the same complication, reward all of them with a Plot Point. Fair warning to players: Be careful what you wish for. Amid combat, complications become something new altogether. Players, use your best judgment when communicating complications. Sometimes, simply informing the Editor on your Turn may be the best approach, or if you believe a note is the most suitable method for a particular complication, consider waiting until your Turn to submit it. That way, you won't break up the game's flow and indirectly take up another player's time.

\</SIDE BAR\>

COMBAT

>   *"Shooting Star once told me that what separated us from the supervillains was our insistence on fighting fair, even when the odds were stacked against us. Unfortunately, zombies don't fight fair either. I still miss Shooting Star."*

The glory days might be gone, but there's no lack of conflict in this world. The zombies keep coming, and the Super Zombies still can't get enough of that hero-on-villain Action. This section gives you all the basics for defending yourself and bringing on the pain.

# \<h1\>How Combat Works

Combat in *Rotted Capes* can be a furious clash between heroes, zombies, super zombies, armed bystanders, or even other supers trying to take what's yours. Survival in the world of rotted capes can sometimes feel like life on the edge of a razor.

The chaos of combat is organized into a cycle of turns and rounds. A typical round represents about 6 seconds of combat. During each round, each combatant gets a turn. Combat starts with everyone rolling Initiative to settle the order of everyone's Turn; once everyone has taken their Turn, combat continues until the conflict is resolved.

### \<H3\> [Combat Step by Step](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Appendix%20B%20-%20Combat#h-Combat%20Step%20by%20Step)

-   **Are you and your opponents aware of each other?** If all combatants know at least one opponent, then there is no need for Surprise.
-   **Set the scene:** The Editor-in-Chief describes the setting and location, provides helpful information, and explains where the heroes are positioned in relation to their adversaries and any bystanders.
-   **Roll** [**Initiative**](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Designing%20Complex%20Traps#h-Initiative)**:** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls [Initiative](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Designing%20Complex%20Traps#h-Initiative), determining the order of combatants' turns.
-   **Take turns**: Each participant in the battle takes a turn in [Initiative](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Designing%20Complex%20Traps#h-Initiative) order.
-   **Begin the next round:** The round ends when everyone involved in the combat has had a turn. Repeat step 4 until the [punching](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Know%20Your%20Players#h-Fighting) stops.

## \<h2\>Surprise

*Apparition phases through a wall clocked in her invisibility, just above a small pack of zombies. A pack that currently stands between her and getting a family of survivors to the enclave.*

*Somewhere else in the city, Silver Star* *and Red Falcon* *are quietly walking through a supermarket distribution warehouse, hoping to find some promising supplies. But little do they know they are being stalked between the crates of boxes by a surprisingly stealthy abomination.*

*In these situations, one side of the battle gains Surprise over the other.*  
  
The Editor-in-Chief determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the Editor-in-Chief should have them perform a *faceoff* utilizing appropriate ability scores (Commonly Dexterity for moving stealthily and Wisdom for finding them), applying any relevant skill sets or edges.   
  
Any combatant who doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.  
  
If you're surprised, you gain the condition *Stunned (Lesser, Surprise)* until the end of your first Turn. A group member can be surprised even if the other members aren't.

## \<h2\>Initiative

At the start of a battle, each player and the Editor-in-Chief (for the bad guys and bystanders) makes a Dexterity check, adding any Initiative bonuses to determine their place in the Initiative order.   
  
The Editor-in-Chief ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. Setting up the order (called the Initiative order) in which they act during each round. The Initiative order remains the same from round to round.

In the case of a tie, the heroes go first. If two or more heroes are tied, allow them to agree on an order amongst themselves. If your threats are tied, they all act simultaneously.

### \<h3\>Joining Combat

Any creature that enters combat in progress makes a dexterity check, adding their initiative bonus, if any, to see where they fall in the current initiative order. Sometimes, a new combatant may enter the unseen combat and surprise everyone.

# \<h1\>On Your Turn

On your Turn, you may take a number of different actions; you may move your Pace and take one **Action**, and a **Bonus Action**, and any number of **Trivial Actions** (within reason). Additionally, between your turns, you may take a special action called a **Reaction.**

## \<h2\> Actions

Each character can take a single **Action** on their Turn, which they may use before, after, or during their movement. When taking an **Action**, you can do the following.

-   Attack
-   Assist
-   Dash
-   Demanding
-   Disengage
-   Dodge
-   Hide
-   Ready

When you describe an Action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, it's up to the Editor-In-Chief to judge if the Action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

## \<h2\>Bonus Actions

Various feats and powers let you take an additional action on your Turn called a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action; otherwise, you don't have a Bonus Action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your Turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your Turn unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take an action also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

## \<h2\> Trivial Actions

Speaking, opening a door, flipping a light switch, drawing a weapon, reading a sign, picking up an item, or even pulling up your cowl are so trivial that they don't take up any of your actions on your Turn. You may perform any number of these actions on your Turn within reason. You're the editor-in-chief, the final arbiter regarding how many trivial actions in any particular situation are reasonable.

**\<side bar\>**

### \<H3\> Editor's Note**: Environmental Complications**

Rotted Capes is a horror game, after all. Sometimes, door jams that have been shut for years, or rust or neglect, make electrical sliding doors tough to open when the power is off. Additionally, that box of supplies may have its bottom rip open from the weight of the cans inside. Even though the rules commonly allow players to interact with the environment for free. It's not always the case. Sometimes, you may have to use all of your Pace, an Action, or maybe even a Demanding Action.

Players may also offer a complication on their Turn in telling the story, in which case, remember to give them a Plot Point; they may very well need it.

**\</side bar\>**

## \<h2\> Reactions

Specific powers, feats, and special circumstances allow you to take a special action called a Reaction.

A Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your Turn or someone else's. The opportunity attack is the most common type of Reaction. You commonly only have one Reaction, but some powers and feats may provide additional reactions. If the Reaction interrupts another creature's Turn, that creature can continue its Turn right after the Reaction.

## \<h2\> Using Powers and Manuvers

Every power and combat maneuver in *Rotted Capes* tells you how it's used; some take an Action, some a Bonus Action, some require a Demanding Action, and others are always on or triggered by specific events.

**Always check the power or maneuver's description**, it will tell you what kind of Action (if any) it takes to use.

You might:

-   Spend an **Action** to blast an enemy across the battlefield,
-   Use a **Bonus Action** dash across the battlefield.
-   Take a **Demanding Action** to teleport across the city,
-   Or use a **Reaction** to activate your force field im response to an attack.
-   Spend an **Action** to Ready setting up an epic Team Attack.

Powers and maneuvers are your heroic toolkit. Use them to punch harder, move faster, hit weirder, and survive longer.

## \<h2\>Movement

*Leaping between rooftops, sprinting through hordes of undead, or dive-bombing a Super-Z before it tears a bus in half, Rotted Capes is just as much superhero action as it is zombie horror. That's why we use areas for movement: a flexible, abstract system that fits the genre's high-energy chaos.*

On your Turn, you can move a number of Areas up to your Pace, capped at 5 Areas unless you have a power, feat, or feature that breaks that limit. You can move all at once, break it up before and after your Action, or just take a step, your call.

You're not locked into one kind of movement either. You can run, fly, swing, climb, or swim, all in the same Turn, if you've got the means. Just deduct the total distance you cover (in Areas) from your Pace as you go. Once you hit 0, you're done moving. Simple.

Want to leap from the roof, swing across the alley, and land behind a wrecked ambulance? Go for it, if you've got the movement to pull it off.

This system is meant to empower imagination and big damn hero moments. Whether you're on a gridded map or just narrating with dice in hand, movement in *Rotted Capes* is there to support the story, not slow it down.

**Example:** If you have a Fly Pace of 10 and a Run Pace of 4, you could run 4 areas and then fly 6 more, using up your total of 10. However, you could not run 5 areas, as your Run Pace cap is at 4.

\<Side Bar\>  
**\<h3\>Playing with 1" squares**   
These rules for movement are intended to create a baseline on how far a hero can move; the movement system in Rotted Capes is designed in such a manner to facilitate the use of tabletop miniatures or playing purely theater of the mind. Use as many or as few of these rules as you and your group feel are necessary.

If you use a map with 1" squares, multiply all paces by 4 to determine the number of squares a creature can move. Whenever a rule specifies an area, use 4x4 squares.

\</Side Bar\>   
  
**\<h3\>Areas**

In *Rotted Capes*, we don't measure movement in feet; we use **Areas**, abstract zones that reflect how far a character can reasonably travel in the chaos of a comic book battle. Outdoor Areas are roughly 400 Sq. Ft. (roughly a 20' x 20' square), while inside, Areas commonly refer to rooms, with exceptionally large rooms (like a warehouse or arena) are split into individual Areas to reflect their scale.

### \<h3\>Being Prone

Sometimes you get knocked on your back end, sometimes you have to dive for Cover, either way, you're Prone. Dropping prone is easy; it costs no movement, but getting back up is another matter. That takes effort. Standing costs half your total Run Pace. You can always use a power to get back up (like Flying), in which case you reduce your Pace by 1.

You can crawl while prone, but it's slow going. Crawling costs +2 Areas per space moved (minimum 1), while crawling through Difficult Terrain is even worse, 4 Areas per space.  
So, if your Pace is 4, you'll need to spend 2 to get on your feet. If your Pace is 0, you're stuck crawling unless a power helps you out.

Example: You've got a Dexterity of 12 (Run Pace 1) and you're prone in a debris-filled hallway (Difficult Terrain). Crawling to the next Area will take you **4 turns** unless you have a better way out.

## \<h2\>Special Movement Types

Some heroes and threats move in ways that defy gravity, terrain, or physics. Whether you're soaring through the air, digging through the earth, or swinging through ruined city skylines, alternate movement types follow the same rules as normal movement, with a few extra traits.  
\<side bar\>

**\<h4\> Climbing & Swimming**

Not everyone's built to scale walls or swing through a flooded subway tunnel, and that includes a lot of our less-graceful heroes.

If you don't have a Climb Pace or Swim Pace, you can still attempt to, but it's slow and taxing. Swimming and climbing without a power of some kind costs 2 areas of movement for every 1 area traveled. This means that a hero with a Pace of 4 will only manage 2 areas of progress while climbing or swimming in a turn.

The Editor may issue a challenge to keep moving, especially if the conditions are dangerous, slick surfaces, strong currents, or that pack of Deadheads splashing after you. Failure means no movement for that Action and possibly losing your grip or getting dragged under.

If the creature has gear (like climbing rigs, fins, or a makeshift raft), they might be able to move at their full Pace or bypass the need to meet a challenge.

And remember, staying still while clinging to the side of a building or treading water in the middle of a bay doesn't mean you're safe. It just means you're a slower target.

\</Side Bar\>

### \<H3\> Flight Pace

Flying characters use their **Fly Pace** in place of their normal Pace. Unless a power or feature says otherwise, flyers:

-   May fly in any direction (up, down, diagonal).
-   Must **spend at least 1 Pace per Turn** to stay airborne.
-   Can mix flying with other movement types if they have both.

**Hovering:**  
If a character can hover, they may stay in the air without moving. If not, they must move at least 1 area per Turn or fall.

**Falling:**  
If you're flying and become **prone**, **restrained**, or your Pace is reduced to 0, you fall, unless you can hover. Falling may cause Damage and leave you vulnerable.

\<side bar\>

### \<h3\>Editor's Note: The dangers of flightâ€¦.

Though many benefits come with the ability to fly, there are also risks that many Heroes don't consider until they have suffered the consequences.

While it is true that flight allows heroes reliable transportation and the ability to escape from the hordes of zombies personally, a flying hero has much more difficulty maintaining a low profile. Flying Heroes frequently draw groups of zombies that see them pass overhead, causing migrations of the undead into possibly populated safe havens.

Many Super Zombies also have flight, and it's not uncommon for titanic battles to occur in midair, particularly when a Hero is caught unawares.

\</side bar\>

### \<h3\>Climb Pace

Characters with a **Climb Pace** can move across vertical or inverted surfaces as easily as walking. And would not be required to meet any challenge to do so unless there is some special condition.

### \<h3\>Swim Pace

Characters with a **Swim Pace** can move through water without having to meet challenges due to swimming in strong currents or rough conditions, while those without a Swim Pace must make checks to avoid sinking or being swept away.

### \<h3\>Swing Pace

Some powers, like *Swinging*, let you move by anchoring to structures and swinging across the battlefield.

To use this movement, you must have a sturdy anchor point within range, such as a beam, wall, tree, Vehicle, or other solid object. If no valid anchor is available, you cannot swing and must rely on other forms of movement.

Once anchored, you can:

-   **Swing:** Move at a pace equal to your power score modifier, treated as flight for purposes of maneuverability. Swinging does not allow you to hover. If you use Swing as normal movement, you end your move standing on the ground. If you Dash, you can choose to remain "mid-swing" between turns.
-   **Climb:** Climb up your line at a pace equal to half your power score modifier.
-   **Hang:** Stay stationary, suspended from your anchor.

The Editor-in-Chief may call for a Challenge if the anchor is unstable, moving, or actively targeted.  
  
**\<h3\>Burrow Pace**

Characters with a **Burrow Pace** can tunnel underground. Burrowing speed and the type of terrain you can pass through depend on your power score:  
  
Power Score:

-   **1-20:** Easy to pass through loose soil and gravel.
-   **21-25:** Can pass through tightly packed earth and stone, leaving a tunnel behind them.
-   **30+:** Swim through the earth like a fish swims the sea, leaving no sign of passage.

Most animals don't have a Burrow Pace, they dig slowly and can't use it in combat. Only creatures with specific powers or traits can burrow effectively.

## \<h2\>Movement Restrictions

Even in an abstract system like Areas, the battlefield isn't always open. Debris, hostiles, and collapsed structures, your environment still matters. Here's how common movement restrictions work in *Rotted Capes*:

### \<h3\>Blocked Areas

Sometimes, an Area is so congested or threatened that you can't get through. This might be a hallway packed with Zs, a barricade of wrecked cars, or a hulking Super-Z like Titan standing in a doorway. You may not move past such Areas unless those enemies are three or more size categories larger or smaller, but you may move past allies with no issue. Many Heroes have fought their last at such chokepoints to buy time for Bystanders to escape.

### \<h3\> Difficult Terrain

A debris-filled warehouse, a living room crowded with furniture, roads littered with abandoned cars and things left behind by fleeing citizens, or an old theater with a collapsed roof. Any Area cluttered with hazards counts as **Difficult Terrain**.

Every area of movement in Difficult Terrain costs 1 extra area. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as Difficult Terrain. Moving through an area occupied by a hostile creature also counts as Difficult Terrain.

### \<h3\>Obstacles

Some things aren't so much terrain as they are barriers, low walls, fallen beams, broken fences.  
Moving across a minor obstacle reduces your **Pace by half** (minimum of 1), while major obstacles may require a **dexterity-based challenge to bypass or a Strength-based challenge to clear the way with** a **Demanding Action**.

### \<h3\>Inadequate Space

Sometimes, a Hero or a large creature may find themselves battling in tight or overcrowded spaces (such as tight hallways filled with zombies). When a creature is crowded or squeezed, it suffers Disadvantage on all actions, as all attacks against the squeezed targetâ€™s Avoidance are made with Advantage. Large creatures may not fit into certain Areas at all, rendering them unable to enter or act.

**Example:** *Silver Star and Red Falcon lure a massive Abomination into a narrow stairwell. Cramped and restricted, the zombie fights at a* **Disadvantage***, while the smaller heroes move freely and gain Advantage on their attacks against its Avoidance.*

# \<h1\> Actions

## \<h2\>Attack

There are two types of attacks in *Rotted Capes*: **melee** and **ranged**. Whether you're punching a zombie in the face, unloading a pistol, or unleashing a kinetic blast, all attacks follow the same basic flow.  
  
**Basically, if** you're rolling a d20 to hit something, you're making an **Attack**, whether it's with a weapon, a power, or just your fists.

### \<h3\>Melee Attacks

Melee attacks happen up close, commonly when you and your target are in the same **Area**.

When making a melee attack, roll a **Strength-based attack roll** against the target's **Avoidance** (or another defense, depending on the power). If the Attack hits, you deal your listed **Damage**, which may include your Strength modifier, weapon bonuses, or power effects.

### \<h3\>Ranged Attacks

Commonly used when trying to hit targets outside your area, when making a ranged attack, roll a **Dexterity-based attack roll** against the target's **Avoidance**. If it hits, apply the Attack's Damage or effect.

Most ranged attacks use guns, bows, or ranged powers. If your target has Cover, the Editor-in-Chief may apply penalties to your attack roll.

### \<H3\>Attacking with powers

Some powers utilize your powers' primary ability instead of your Strength or Dexterity. In these cases, your attack roll is based on the **primary ability** of the power.

For Example, a psychic attack can use either your **Wisdom or Charisma**, while an Enhanced Melee Attack might use **Wisdom**, depending on your choices during hero creation.

Your power's description will tell you: What type of roll to make, which defense to attack, and whether it deals Damage, causes a condition, or does something stranger

### \<h3\>Rolling 1 or 20 on an attack roll.

If you roll a natural 20, your Attack is a critical hit, it automatically hits, and instead of hitting Stamina, it deals a Wound directly. Criticals feel good. Let them land hard.  
  
If the d20 roll for an Attack is a 1, the Attack misses, regardless; even the most powerful heroes miss from time to time.

## \<h2\>Assist

You can help another creature succeed at a task. When you take the Assist Action, the creature you're helping gains Advantage on their next attack roll or ability check, as long as they make the check before the start of your next turn.

## \<h2\>Dash

Taking the dash action allows you to move twice your pace during your Turn.

## \<h2\>Demanding

Some actions take longer to execute, such as charging up a power, hacking a console mid-combat, or pulling off a risky maneuver under fire; such actions are **Demanding Actions**.

A **Demanding Action** isn't your standard, snap-second move. It takes your full focus, limits your movement, and delays the effect until the start of your next Turn.

If an action is labeled **Demanding**, it follows the special rules below.

While performing a Demanding Action:

-   You **may not move more than 1 area** during your Turn.
-   You **may not take Reactions** while performing a Demanding action.
-   You may only take a **Bonus Action** **before** you begin your Demanding Action.
-   If anything prevents you from taking actions (e.g., conditions or effects), you **cannot** perform a Demanding Action.

Additional rules for Demanding Actions:

-   **Attackers gain Advantage** when targeting you during this time.
-   The **effect of the Action** occurs at the **start of your next Turn**.
-   If the Action involves a **Burnout cost**, you must pay that cost when you begin the Action, not when it resolves.

### \<h3\> Interruptible

Some Demanding Actions are labeled **Interruptible**, meaning they can be disrupted if you take Damage or are successfully attacked before the Action completes. If you are hit or suffer Damage while performing an Interruptible action:

-   You must make a **Constitution saving throw**.
    -   The DC is **10**, or **half the Stamina damage taken after DR**, whichever is higher.
    -   If you suffer a **Wound**, the DC is set to **25**.
-   You must make a **new saving throw each time** you take Damage.
-   If you **fail** any of these saves, the Action is **disrupted** and does not complete.
-   If interrupted, you **do not pay any Burnout cost**.
-   You may try the Action again on a future turn if desired.

**Example:**   
Stepaside attempts to use his power, *Geospatial Shift*, to escape a dangerous situation. The power requires an **Interruptible Demanding Action**, so he moves 1 area back and begins the process.

Before his next Turn, Flaming Fist hits him with a fire bolt that deals 10 Stamina damage. Stepaside must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 10 (since half of 10 = 5). If he fails, the Action is interrupted and does not occur, but he can try again on his next Turn.

**\<h2\> Disengage**  
If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke [opportunity attacks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_40) for the rest of the Turn.

## \<h2\>Dodge

When you take the dodge action, until the start of your next turn, all attacks against your Avoidance are made at a Disadvantage. You must be able to see where the Attack is coming from to benefit from this Action; you lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or your Pace drops to 0

## \<h2\>Hide

When you take the **Hide** Action, you attempt to vanish from sight, ducking behind Cover, slipping into shadows, or using the chaos of battle to disappear.

To do so, you must participate in a *face-off challenge* against any possible observers. This might require a *dexterity-based challenge* against the result of a *wisdom-based challenge* by any observers, applying applicable skill sets or edges. If you succeed, you're considered hidden, and you gain the benefits described under **Unseen Attackers and Targets**, including Advantage when you strike from the shadows.

Remember, zombies can't eat what they can't see. Probably.

## \<h2\>Ready

Sometimes, the best move is to wait for the perfect moment. When you want to act in response to something specific, you can use the **Ready** Action.

**Choose a trigger,** a visible event or condition you're waiting for, and **declare your response,** either an **Action** you'll take or movement up to your normal Pace.

Your Reaction will then go off **when that trigger happens**, as long as it occurs before the start of your next Turn. Just remember: if your trigger never happens, you lose the Action; waiting comes with risk.

Examples:  
*"If those zombies walk through the archway, I'll pull the lever and drop the blast doors."  
"If that merc charges me, I'll blast him with a power shot."*

# \<h1\> Rections

Reactions are a special kind of Action that takes place between your turns. Unlike other actions, all Reactions require a trigger, unless that trigger is satisfied, you may not use that Reaction. While some Feats, Powers, and maneuvers are performed as a reaction, the most common Reaction is the opportunity attack..

## \<h2\>Opportunity Attacks

Combat is chaotic, but smart fighters watch for openings, and savage zombies strike when someone's back is turned. These moments are called **Opportunity Attacks**.

Whenever a **hostile creature you can see leaves your Area**, you can use your **Reaction** to make a **melee attack** against them. That Attack happens **just before** they exit your reach.

Opportunity Attacks don't happen often, but they hit hard when they do.

You do not get an opportunity attack when:

-   The creature teleports out of your Area.
-   It uses the Disengage Action.
-   It's pushed, pulled, thrown, or moved by something else (like an explosion, gravity, or a power).
-   You can't see the creature.

## \<h2\>Combat Modifiers

Attack roles can be modified by circumstances in combat, such as Cover and range.

### \<h3\>Ranged Modifiers

You suffer Disadvantage on attack rolls when attempting to hit a target with a ranged attack under the following conditions:

-   The target is within your area.
-   The target is beyond your weapon's or power's maximum range.
-   The target is engaged in melee combat.

Trying to thread a shot through a fistfight is a risky move.

### \<h3\>Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to disappear, either by hiding in darkness, vanishing with powers like **invisibility**, or just staying out of sight.

When you attack a target you can't see, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. This applies whether you're guessing the target's location or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. You automatically miss if the target isn't in your designated location. Typically, the editor-in-chief will state that the Attack was missed without revealing whether your guess was accurate.

On the flip side, if **they can't see you**, you attack at **Advantage**. If you're **hidden** (unseen *and* unheard), you reveal your location the moment you attack, whether you hit or not.

### \<h3\>Cover

Punching someone through an open window or shooting a person taking Cover behind an abandoned car can be challenging. Cover sometimes can be the difference between life or being blasted to pieces.

**Partial Cover** means at least half the target is blocked, either by a wall, tree, car, furniture, or even another creature. Attacks against a target with partial Cover are made at **Disadvantage**.

**Total Cover** means the target is completely blocked, you **can't target them directly** with attacks or powers, though **area effects** may still reach them. Think closed doors, thick walls, or being completely behind a barrier.

### \<h3\>Line of Sight & Line of Effect

To target a creature with most attacks or effects, you must have **a line of sight;** in other words, you have to know where they are.

This doesn't have to be strictly visual. Darkness, smoke, and powers can all obscure line of sight. If you attack without seeing your target, you roll with **Disadvantage**, and you must have **some way** to know where they are. (at the Editor-in-Chief's discretion).

But seeing a target isn't always enough. Most of the time you'll need a **clear path** to reach them.

A solid wall, a pane of thick glass, or force fields might **block the line of effect**, even if you can see the target through them. Most attacks and powers require **both** line of sight and line of effect to work.

### Pet Animals and Summoned Creatures in Combat

Animals and summoned creatures act as a single unit with their controller when in combat; thus, they go on the same Initiative.

\</side bar\>

## \<h2\> Meeting a Challenge, using Powers, and Maneuvers in combat

In *Rotted Capes*, you don't just attack and move; you might find yourself hacking terminals mid-battle, leaping rooftops with precision, defusing bombs under pressure, and unleashing devastating powers. The following rules explain how to **meet a challenge**, **use** **powers**, and perform a **combat maneuver** in combat.

### \<h3\>Meeting a Challenge

During combat, either you or the Editor-in-Chief may present a Challenge. Overcoming it could require an action, determined by the Editor-in-Chief according to the nature of the Challenge and what it is attempting to achieve.

Here are some examples:

-   Glancing around for exits or recalling the colors of a rival gang? Free action, quick insights in the moment.
-   Methodically searching a supply closet, forcing open a barricaded door, or slipping away from guards? That would require an Action.
-   Disarming a tripwire mid-chase, splicing into a secure network under fire, or trying to drive a semi through a collapsing parking garage? That might require a **Demanding Action.**

The Editor-in-Chief decides when a challenge calls for a roll, what kind of Action it requires (if any), and whether special conditions, like Advantage or Disadvantage, apply.

### \<h3\> Using Powers

Every power has its own listed activation method. Some powers are used with a standard Action, while others may trigger as a Reaction, Bonus Action, or require a Demanding Action. A few powers are passive, always active as long as their conditions are met.

For Example, blasting someone with a power might require an Action, while attempting to teleport your team across the city while a horde of zombies is breaking their way through the drywall, an Interruptible Demanding Action.

## \<h3\> Performing a Combat Maneuver

Maneuvers are special actions you can take in combat. Everyone knows a few basic maneuvers, with more complex maneuvers being learned through the **Learn Maneuver** feat. Much like powers, each maneuver lists what Action is required to use it.

For Example, setting up a Team Attack with an ally requires a reaction, while grappling an opponent takes an action.

# \<h1\> Damage and Death

## \<h2\> Stamina and Wounds

**Stamina** measures your physical and mental stamina, and itâ€™s the kind of damage you can shrug off, such as bruises, stress, and near-misses. No matter how much Stamina you've lost, you still fight at full capacity. It recovers quickly with rest and doesn't leave lasting effects.

**Temporary Stamina** is a short-term buffer, an extra pool of Stamina that absorbs Damage before it affects your actual Stamina score. When you gain Temporary Stamina, it increases your current Stamina for a limited time. Any stamina damage you take is first subtracted from this buffer; only the excess, if any, is applied to your regular Stamina.

Temporary Stamina fades quickly. If the power or effect that granted it ends, any unused Temporary Stamina disappears immediately. You cannot stack Temporary Stamina from multiple sources; gaining new Temporary Stamina automatically removes any remaining from the previous effect.

**Wounds** are serious. Where Stamina handles the superficial Damage, **Wounds represent real injury**, like broken bones and deep cuts.

When you take Wound damage, it hits hard, literally. Your ability to act is diminished, and recovery isn't quick. Wounds don't bounce back with a nap; they take time, rest, and sometimes the help of someone who knows what they're doing and has the gear to do it. And in this world, that's not always an option.   
  
**\<h3\>Dealing Stamina Damage**

Most attacks, whether from weapons, unarmed strikes, or damaging powers, reduce a target's **Stamina**. The amount of Damage of the power or weapon used, which is commonly modified by the attacker's relevant ability score or special bonuses.

To resolve Damage, roll the appropriate dice and apply any relevant modifiers, such as an ability score or feat bonus. Then subtract the target's **Damage Resistance (DR)** from the total. Whatever remains is subtracted from the target's Stamina. **Damage Resistance (DR)** can reduce Damage to zero.

### **\<h4\>Damage Resistance (DR)**

**Damage Resistance** doesn't stop you from getting hit, but it softens the blow. Whenever you take Damage, subtract any applicable DR from the total before applying it to Stamina. DR might come from armor, force fields, powers, or other effects.

If multiple sources of DR apply, use only the **highest one**. Some effects, like precision strikes or armor-piercing attacks, can bypass DR entirely, as described in the effect.

Example: If you have DR 5 against energy and DR 10 against fire, and a fire attack hits you, you reduce the Damage by 10.

### \<h3\>Dealing Wounds & Massive Damage

**Wounds** represent massive harm; there are two main ways you deal Wound damage.

-   **Critical Hits:** When you score a critical hit, you also deal **1 Wound** of Damage in addition to Stamina Damage.
-   **Massive Damage:** You deal **1 Wound** of Damage any time an attack deals more stamina damage after Damage Reduction (DR) than your target's Fortitude defense.

If you roll a critical hit and deal enough Stamina damage to bypass your target's Fortitude Defense, you deal **2 Wounds** of Damage.

### \<h3\>Knockback

When a creature is struck with a **kinetic attack** (including fists, baseball bats, TK bolts, etc.) and suffers *Massive Damage* or is dealt a *critical hit*, it may be knocked back if the attacker has a Strength of 20 or higher or possesses the **Enhanced Strength** origin feature.

When that happens, the creature is either knocked to the ground or sent flying:

-   If they are knocked to the ground, they are *prone*, in your area.
-   If they are sent flying, they are moved 1 area away from the attacker for every 10 points of Damage dealt (minimum of 1 area), rounded down.
    -   If the creature hits a solid object along its path, it suffers kinetic Damage equal to half the object's material strength, plus 1d6 kinetic Damage per full area traveled, after which your target falls prone.
    -   If the creature has not impacted any object along its path, once your target lands, it can roll a dexterity-based Challenge against a DC equal to the Damage suffered after DR. Skill Sets may apply. On a success, the target stays on their feet; on a failure, they fall prone.

Don't forget that objects have structure, too! Throwing someone into a rotted-out wall may not stop them but hurling them into a steel column definitely will. Feel free to improvise! Especially if it paints a cool story moment! A good rule of thumb is that if a creature possesses a DR equal to or greater than the material strength of an object they impact while being knocked back, they always break through the barrier.

\<Side Bar\>

#### \<h4\> Editor's Notes: Remember!

A Hero can spend a Plot Point to cause additional complications (e.g., the tumbling crates) or to save himself from a complication resulting from a knockback (e.g., grasping a flagpole when falling from a skyscraper).

\</Side Bar\>

### \<h3\>Continuous Damage

When you're taking continuous Damage, like being on fire or soaked in acid, the total ongoing Damage adds up. All continuous Damage you suffer during a scene is **cumulative**, regardless of the source. Once the **total** Damage exceeds your **Stamina Defense**, you suffer **Massive Damage**, and the count **resets to zero**. After that, the buildup starts again from scratch.

No matter the source, you usually get a **saving throw at the end of your Turn** to shake off the effect and stop the pain.

## \<h2\>How to injure Zombies

As they aren't exactly "alive," zombies follow special rules when injured. **Zombies do not have Stamina**; they do not tire, nor do they react to the most egregious injuries. There are only three ways to injure zombies: crushing their heads through *Massive Damage,* dealing a lucky Wound with a Critical Hit, and using some maneuvers, such as Devastating Attack or Headshot, which destroy lower-rank zombies outright.

When a zombie is reduced to 0 Wounds, it's destroyed.

### \<h3\>Massive Damage and Zombies

*Massive Damage* can be quite effective against the run-of-the-mill zombie but is also a game-changer when facing more powerful abominations and Super Zombies.

Any time a Zombie of Epsilon level or below suffers Massive Damage, it is instantly destroyed.

Delta level and higher Zombies and Super Zombies suffer normal wound damage, but do not suffer any penalties for suffering wound damage.

### \<h3\>Zombies and Continuous Damage

It's a popular myth that zombies are vulnerable to fire; as unfeeling corpses, it's fair to say that they are less bothered by fire than humans. That said, a zombie lacks the survival instinct to put out a fire or remove acids eating away at them.

Once a Zombie suffers enough total Damage by continuous Damage to bypass their Stamina Defense, they suffer 1 wound of Damage, enough to destroy a common Z. Super Z's, on the other hand, have the cunning to remove dangerous conditions from their bodies. Still, they may forget in the heat of battle.

## \<h2\>Combat Modes

Not every battle plays out the same way, and not every villain fights fair. *Combat Modes* are optional tools the Editor-in-Chief can use to adjust the tone, pacing, or stakes of a fight, all without needing to redesign stat blocks or call for a full rewrite of the scene. These modes allow you to scale an encounter up or down, spotlight a key villain, or turn a horde of weaklings into a real threat.

The game currently includes these Combat Modes:

-   **Danger Zone: The environment itself becomes a threat to the heroes.**
-   **Horde Rules:** when weaker threats combine into a single collective powerful threat.
-   **Unleashed:** When the villain stops holding back and reveals just how dangerous they really are.

### \<h33\>Horde Rules

*Horde Rules* allow the Editor-in-Chief to combine five or more identical creatures in the same area into a single, more dangerous unit, simplifying combat while keeping the threat palpable. Hordes move and Attack as one, gaining strength with each member that joins, and growing weaker as the heroes cut them down.

Any time 5 or more of the same creatures are in the same area, they become a Horde and use the following rules.

-   Hordes act as a single creature. If a Horde is formed after combat has started, the Horde, once formed, falls into the Initiative of its lowest member.
-   Hordes move as a single unit and must remain in the same area to function as a Horde.
-   Hordes act and attack as if they were one creature; Hordes may may attack one or two targets, gaining +2 bonus to hit and Damage for each active member of the Horde beyond the first (a a Horde of 6 would gain +10 to hit and Damage) if the Horde is splitting its attacks on two targets this bonus is split by the number of creatures attacking each target.
-   Hordes may make one Opportunity Attack per member of the horde, using their full attack bonus. For each Opportunity Attack after the first the hordes bonus to attack and damage drop by one member of the Horde.
-   All attacks against a Horde target a single creature within it, dealing Damage until that creature is taken out, reducing the Horde's size. Effects that impose conditions or control apply to one creature unless they affect the entire area, while area-based attacks affect all members within the area normally.
-   Any member of the Horde is then removed from the area, is removed from the Horde, and acts as an individual creature, keeping the same Initiative as the Horde it was once part of.
-   A Horde that drops below 5 members is no longer considered a Horde and reverts to individual creature actions.

### \<h3\> Unleashed: When the Gloves Come Off

Even villains know when to stop holding back. Some threats save their deadliest moves for when the heroes have them cornered, or when the story demands it. This isn't cheating the rules; it's revealing the villain as a true threat.

When the Editor-in-Chief declares a villain is *Unleashed*, the villain gains:

-   One additional Turn each round at Initiative -10, which includes a chance to recharge abilities.
-   They gain an additional reaction
-   Once per round, the villain may roll with Advantage on any attack, defense, or saving throw.
-   Once per round, the Editor-in-Chief may use a plot point to have the villain automatically succeed in a saving throw.
-   Double the threats' Stamina (if not a brute) or 2 additional wounds if a zombie.
-   Once per encounter, the Villain can have a "second wind "and use an action to recover 1d4 wounds.

### \<sidebar\>  \<h3\> When to Unleash the Villain

Not every villain needs to be *Unleashed.* Reserve it for pivotal moments: the showdown at the end of a story arc, a major super-zombie on a rampage, or when the players are breezing through a fight that should feel dire. Unleashing is your tool to bring a dramatic, comic-book escalation to the fight without rewriting stats or feeling unfair.

It signals to the players: *This villain means business nowâ€¦. bring your A-game.*  
Don't overuse it. Too many Unleashed villains can make it feel routine instead of cinematic. Pick your moments and let the heroes shine when they overcome it.

\</sidebar\>

### \<h3\> Danger Zone

*"Then the floor just gave way underneath us."*

Some battles take place in environments just as deadly as the villains. Whether it's a burning building, a crumbling bridge, or a mall overrun with traps, the battlefield itself becomes a threat.

When the Editor-in-Chief declares a *Danger Zone*, the environment is treated as a threat. Environmental effects can take one or two turns a round, acting on their own Initiative count (after all the players roll Initiative, place the environmental "action" in the middle of the Initiative count and/or at the end of the round.)

Some examples of events during Danger Zone:

-   Collapse part of the floor or ceiling, forcing Dexterity saves or suffering Damage.
-   Unleash a wave of fire, water, or falling debris.
-   Open a new hole in the defenses, letting more zombies pour in.
-   Blind heroes with smoke, dust, or flashing lights.

A simple guideline when creating damaging environmental events on the fly, utilize a bonus to hit and saving throw DC equal to a threat of the Hero's average rank (see Table X-X Treat Parameters and Table X-X Trait Save DCs) and Damage as a threat 2 ranks lower.

The Danger Zone should add to a scene, not overshadow the villain or heroes. Use it to keep players moving, split their focus, or reinforce the horror of the world around them. Be careful how you use them, as they can unnecessarily drag out an encounter. Heroes who think out of the box (or spend Plot Points) can mitigate or even disable environmental events.

## \<h2\>Damage Types & Categories

Different attacks, damaging powers, and other harmful effects deal different types of Damage. Damage Types have no rules, but other rules, such as Damage Reduction, rely on the types.

Feel free to create new energy types, but be warned: If the selection is too exotic, the power becomes far more powerful.

\< sidebar\>  
**\<h4\> Psychic damage**

Note that Psychic Damage is a special case; due to its nature, Psychic Damage ignores DR from any source, which does not explicitly protect against Psychic Damage. However, it also has no effect against Zombies (even Super Zombies).

\</side bar\>  
  
Below is a complete list of **Damage Types** with examples to help the editor-in-chief assign a damage type to a new Effect.

**Acid:** Corrosive substance that eats away at targets, causing melting or disintegration.

**Ballistic:** Damage inflicted by firearms, bullets, or other high-speed projectile-based weapons.

**Cold:** Extreme cold or ice-based attacks that freeze or slow down targets.

**Cosmic:** is the boundless energy of the universe itself; cosmic Damage manipulates reality, space, and time.

**Electricity:** Electric shocks or discharges that deliver high-voltage Damage to targets.

**Fire:** Flames and intense heat that burn and scorch targets.

**Kinetic:** Physical impact (such as punching) or force-based attacks that rely on sheer momentum or concussive blows.

**Piercing:** Attacks penetrating and piercing through armor or flesh, causing deep wounds.

**Poison:** Toxic substances or venom that inflict harm over time or impair the target's functions.

**Psychic:** Mental or telepathic attacks that manipulate thoughts, emotions, or perceptions.

**Radioactive:** Ionizing radiation that can melt objects, burn flesh, cause cellular Damage, or radiation sickness.

**Slashing:** Cutting or slashing attacks with bladed weapons, claws, or sharp objects.

**Sonic:** Sound-based attacks that utilize powerful vibrations or shockwaves to damage targets.

With **Damage Categories**, we further generalize Damage according to its source, either Energy or Physical.

**Energy** consists of cold, cosmic, electrical, fire, radioactive, and sonic Damage.

**Physical** Damage consists of acid, ballistic, kinetic, piercing, and slashing.

Poison & Psychic Damage are not part of either category.

### \<h3\>Dropping to 0 Stamina

Once you reach 0 Stamina, you are *Unconscious,* and although you are helpless, you will not die without outside influence. See the conditions below for the *Unconscious's* effects.

### \<h3\>Wounded and Dropping to 0 Wounds

As long as you have any wounds of damage, you are in the *Wounded* condition.

If you reach 0 wounds but still have Stamina remaining, you are considered *Incapacitated* and in terrible pain.

If you are reduced to 0 Wounds and Stamina, you are dead unless they or a fellow player spends a Plot Point; in this case, you regain 1 Wound but remain *Unconscious*.

Alternatively, you may escape death by accepting a physical flaw and having your maximum wounds reduced by 1.

For the *Helpless, Unconscious, and Wounded* conditions, see conditions on pg XX below.  
  
\<sidebar\>

### \<h3\> Going out in a blaze of glory

*Sometimesâ€¦ heroes dieâ€¦. they make it count.*

When your Hero hits 0 Wounds and 0 Stamina, you may choose to **go out in a blaze of glory.**

As your final act, you get:

-   One Action, taken immediately as a Reaction
-   Automatic Critical Hit on any attack or Advantage on a Power Check if using a power
-   No Plot Point can save you; your Hero diesâ€¦

Make it count. Go out like a legend.

\</sidebar\>

### \<h3\>Healing and Death

Heroes are made of stern stuff. So, at the end of a scene, you recover all of your Stamina.

If you are *Unconscious* at the end of a scene due to stamina loss*,* assuming you aren't a zombie chow, you regain **half your total Stamina** instead.

However, healing wounds is another matter entirely

You must take **one hiatus per Wound** you currently have before attempting to recover. So, if you've taken 2 Wounds, you'll need to take **2** **Hiatuses** before you can even try to heal one of them.

After which, you must make a successful Routine (DC: 15) Constitution saving throw to recover 1 wound; if you fail this check by 5 or more, things get worse, maybe a lot worse, roll on the Wound Recovery table to see how your condition deteriorates. If someone is treating you with an appropriate skill set (e.g., Combat Medic, Doctor, Special Forces Operative), you gain advantage on this saving throw.

| Table x-x: Wound Recovery |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Fail by 4 or less.        | You do not recover a Wound and suffer no additional adverse effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Fail by 5 or more.        | You do not recover a wound and permanently reduce a random attribute score by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Roll a 1                  | You suffer an additional Wound as your condition worsens. At 0 Wounds, you succumb to your injuries and die. To avoid this result, you may choose a Physical Condition (see Weaknesses, pg. xx) instead. If this option is chosen, the Hero heals a Wound and takes on the flaw.  |

# \<h1\>Conditions

Sometimes the dice aren't the only thing working against you. Crtain events, powers, gear, and environmental effects will impose Conditions on your Hero, their allies, or their enemies. Conditions are shorthand for a specific mechanical effect on the game, and they're meant to be fast to apply and easy to remember.  
  
Here is the core list of the most common and impactful states you'll run into. Everything else, whether you're on fire, frozen in place, or invisible to thermal scanners, is handled through Tags that customize a core condition or dictate its severity.

Think of it this way:

-   **Core Condition** = the framework of what happens to you.
-   **Tag** = the flavor, severity, additional details.

You apply the condition first, then add any tags.  
  
**\<h2\>Using Tags**

Whenever you see a condition applied in these rules, the Editor-in-Chief may add one or more tags to describe it in play. Tags may:

-   Indicate the source or element (Fire, Acid, Poison, Sonic).
-   Indicate the severity (Lesser, Greater, Partial).
-   Indicate the targeted sense (Visual, Thermal, All Senses).
-   Indicate special effects (DR penalty, movement restriction, added saves).

**Example:**

A Super-Z sprays you with acid: *Ongoing Damage (Engulfed â€“ Acid, DR -2 to armor)*.  
A flashbang detonates nearby: *Stunned (Lesser, Sonic)*.  
You cloak in adaptive camo: *Hidden (Undetectable â€“ Visual)*.

## \<h2\> List of Conditions

### \<h3\>Blinded

You cannot see. You automatically fail any check that requires sight, attacks against you have Advantage, and your attacks have Disadvantage.  
**Tags:** *Partial (+2/-2 instead of advantage/disadvantage)*, *Energy Type* (e.g., Flash â€“ Light)

### \<h3\>Charmed

You cannot target the charmer with attacks, powers, or harmful effects. The charmer has Advantage on all social interactions with you. Lastly, the condition ends if the charmer or their allies attack you or force you to do something against your nature.

**Tags:** *Magical, Psionic, Emotional, Seduction, Mind Control.*

### \<h3\>Exhaustion

Some Special Abilities, Burnout, being Wounded, and environmental Hazards, such as starvation and the long-Â­term Effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a Special condition called Exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. The Penalty below applies to all challenge and attack roles, as well as the creature's Pace. If a creature's place is reduced to 0, they can still move, but their Pace, regardless of mode, is reduced to 0, and they must use the dash action to move 1 area.

Tags: Burnout, Environmental, Sleep Deprivation.

| Exhaustion Effects |             |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Level              | **Penalty** |
| 1                  | -1          |
| 2                  | -2          |
| 3                  | -3          |
| 4                  | -4          |
| 5                  | -5          |
| 6                  | Death\*     |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another Effect that causes Exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

An Effect that removes Exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion Effects Ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1. Finishing a Hiatus reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

\<side bar\>

### \<h3\>Optional Rule: Brutal Continuity, Exhaustion

When playing in the Brutal Continuity, the penalty also applies to the Hero's saves, defenses, and burnout threshold.   
\</side bar\>

### \<h3\>Frightened

You have Disadvantage on checks and attack rolls while the source of your fear is within line of sight, and you cannot willingly move closer to it.  
**Tags:** *Mild* (affects only certain rolls), *Severe* (full effect), *Specific Target*.

### \<h3\>Grappled

Your Pace becomes 0, and you cannot benefit from bonuses to Pace. The condition ends if the grappler is Incapacitated or you break free.

**Tags:** *Source* (Tentacle, Net, Cable), *Partial* (one limb only), *Immobilized* (cannot take any movement actions).

### \<h3\> H**idden**

You are unseen by your target(s). You have Advantage on attack rolls against them, and they have Disadvantage to detect or target you. Attacking or making noise usually ends this condition.  
**Tags:** *Undetectable â€“ Visual*, *Undetectable â€“ Thermal*, *Undetectable â€“ All Senses*.

### \<h3\> **Ongoing Damage**

You take the listed Damage at the start (or end) of your Turn until the condition ends. The source may also impose penalties. Unless stated otherwise, a successful saving throw, Action (Stop, Extinguish, Cleanse) using an appropriate Skill Set, or power ends the effect.  
**Tags:** *Engulfed â€“ Fire* (Disadvantage on attacks), *Engulfed â€“ Acid* (DR penalty), *Bleeding*, *Electrical*.

### **\<h3\> Prone**

You are on the ground. You have Disadvantage on melee attacks, your attacks at range are unaffected, and melee attacks against you have Advantage. You can spend half your Pace to stand up.

### \<h3\> **Restrained**

Your Pace becomes 0, attacks against you have Advantage, and your attacks have Disadvantage. You also automatically fail Avoidance checks against area effects.  
Tags: *Immobilized (no actions that require movement), Partial (one limb restrained).*

### \<h3\> Stunned

You are disoriented

-   **Lesser:** You have Disadvantage on all rolls, cannot take Reactions.
-   **Greater:** As lesser additionally drop what's in your hands and all attacks on you have Advantage.

Tags: *Cause (Sonic, Electrical).*

### \<h3\> Unconscious

You are unaware of your surroundings, cannot act, and drop anything you are holding. You automatically fail Avoidance and Willpower checks, and attacks against you from within the same area are critical hits.  
Tags: *Knocked Out, Medical, Power-Induced.*

### \<h3\> Weakened

You suffer a penalty to a specific Ability Score, Power Score, or Defense.

-   **Default Effect:** You take a **â€“2 penalty** to all rolls, checks, and derived stats based on the targeted Ability/Power/Defense for the duration, If the Penalty reduces the targeted score's modifier below 0, you use the new negative value for all calculations.
-   **Stacking:** Multiple instances affecting the same stat do not stack; instead, take the higher Penalty.

**Tags:** *Ability Score* (Strength, Dexterity, etc.), *Power Score*, *Defense* (Avoidance, Fortitude, Willpower), *Type* (Poison, Psychic, Radiation), *Severity* (Mild = â€“1, Severe = â€“4, Crippling = score halved).

### \<h3\>Wounded

You suffer a penalty to all challenge rolls and attack rolls equal to the amount of wound damage you currently have; these penalties do not stack with Exhaustion.

You may only remove the Wound condition by healing all wounds.

# \<h2\> Size Categories & Cinematic Scale

Not every Hero fights on the same scale. Some, like the towering "Giant Man" or monstrous super zombies, grow to incredible proportions. Others shrink to the size of a rat to infiltrate tight spaces. While Rotted Capes already measures strength and power in cinematic terms, size plays a unique role in how you interact with the world, allies, and enemies.

When your Hero (or threat) changes size, it's not just about how much you can lift; it changes the story of the scene. Being huge in a cramped stairwell can make you more vulnerable, while being small lets you slip through a sewer grate but risks being trampled in a melee.

Below are the standard Size Categories. Unless otherwise noted, all heroes and bystanders are **Medium.**

| Size Categories Table |                       |                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Tiny                  | Cat, drone            | +2 to Avoidance vs. larger attackers, disadvantage on grappling; can move through spaces only a few inches wide.                |
| Small                 | Child, dog            | No additional modifiers.                                                                                                        |
| Medium                | Human                 | Default.                                                                                                                        |
| Large                 | Horse, car            | +1 area reach, +1 to grapples, disadvantage in tight/confined spaces.                                                           |
| Huge                  | School bus, whale     | +2 area reach, counts as occupying 4 areas, disadvantage in cramped or crowded environments, more susceptible to group attacks. |
| Gargantuan            | Building, tank, kaiju | +3 area reach, occupies 9+ areas, may not fit into most structures, area attacks automatically include you.                     |

# \<h1\>Vehicles and Mounts

Mounts and Vehicles function as extensions of their riders; they have their statistics and suffer Damage, but never act independently. Instead, the Hero directs their actions.

### \<h3\>Movement and Control

You utilize their Vehicle or Mount's Pace instead of your own. For full rules on Pace and acceleration, refer to the Gear section, pg. XX.

**Mounts:** When riding a mount, you have two options: control it or allow it to act independently.

-   **Controlled Mount:** If the mount has been trained to accept a rider, it moves on your Initiative and follows your direction. It may take Disengage, Dodge, or Attack on your Turn.
-   **Independent Mount:** An untrained or wild mount keeps its own Initiative and acts according to its instincts, not yours. It may panic, flee, or charge without warning.

If your mount provokes an Opportunity Attack while you're riding it, attackers may choose to target either you or the mount.

**Vehicles:** unlike mounts, you must take control of the Vehicle. Driving a vehicle requires your Action.

**Challenges While Driving or Riding**

Heroes don't normally need to roll to operate a vehicle or ride a mount under standard conditions. However, when attempting risky maneuvers, stunts, or avoiding danger, the Editor-in-Chief may call for a Challenge using a relevant Skill Set.

Use your Rank Bonus + relevant Ability Modifier and apply any situational modifiers (like the Vehicle's Handling rating). The Editor sets the DC based on difficulty and context.

If you lack a relevant Skill Set, roll with **Disadvantage**.

If your Skill Set includes specialized Vehicle or mount experience (e.g., *Courier Biker*, *Mounted Ranger*, *Combat Driver*), you may roll with **Advantage** when the narrative supports it.

### \<h3\>Attacking from a Vehicle or Mount

When attacking from a moving vehicle, you may gain the advantage of Cover, but, depending on your Vehicle's speed, suffer reduced accuracy.

When attacking from a moving vehicle, you suffer Disadvantage on your attack rolls if the Vehicle moves 5 areas more than your target in the previous Turn. Additionally, you may suffer penalties for attacking at range.

### \<h3\>Attacking a Vehicle or Mount

When attacking a Vehicle or Mount, the attacker may choose to attack the Vehicle/Mount or one of its passengers.

**If attacking a vehicle:** Your Attack is rolled against the roll against the **controller's passive Challenge DC** using the appropriate Skill Set (*e.g.,* Animal Handler, Driver, Pilot). Large or huge vehicles may grant the attacker **Advantage.** If the Vehicle is unattended and stationary, no attack roll is necessary. When attacking an unattended mount, you roll against the mount's defense.

**If attacking the driver or passenger:** if the Vehicle moved 5+ areas more than you in the previous round, roll with Disadvantage. Missed attacks that exceed the controller's passive Challenge DC may instead hit the Vehicle.

### \<h3\>Losing Control

If a vehicle takes Damage equal to or greater than its Material Strength, the controller must make a DC 15 Challenge using a relevant Skill Set (*like Combat Driver or Wheelman*) to retain control.

Apply a penalty equal to the excess Damage over the Vehicle's Material Strength.

Results are determined by the Editor, but consequences may include loss of control, skidding, or full-on crashes. Plot Points can be used to mitigate the outcome.

### \<h3\>Crashing

Creatures within a crashing vehicle suffer Stamina damage equal to the Vehicle's Material Strength plus d6 for every Area traveled in the previous Turn. Creatures outside of a crashing vehicle suffer d8 for every Area traveled in the previous Turn.

Appropriate safety equipment (such as seat belts, airbags, and so on) may reduce this Damage.

The Vehicle itself may survive the crash or be unsalvageable at the Editor-in-chief's discretion; of course, there are always Plot Points.

### \<h3\>The Wireless Power and Modern Vehicles

Most modern vehicles possess computer-controlled components. As such, a Hero or villain with the Wireless power may attempt to shut down the Vehicle. Due to a lack of effective electronic countermeasures against such an attack, such a task requires an action and a DC: 20 Power check.

Military or custom vehicles may increase the difficulty to as high as DC: 30 and require a Demanding Action.

## \<h2\>Attacking and Destroying Objects

Sometimes, you may need to break down a door, snap apart chains, or shatter an enemy's plasma gun.

The durability of items is reflected by two values: Material Strength (MS) and Hits. Material Strength represents the object's resistance against Damage and works like Damage Resistance. Hits represent the amount of punishment the item can absorb. Each time the Damage of an attack surpasses the item's MS, the item suffers 1 Hit (regardless of the amount of Damage dealt). *Critical strikes* inflict 2 Hits only if the damage roll surpasses the item's MS. Any attack that deals Damage equal to doubles an item's MS + Hits destroys it outright. Once the item reaches 0 Hits, it's broken.

Items that are damaged but not broken retain their MS and remaining Hits until repaired as appropriate for the item in question.

**Stationary Targets**: You do not need to roll to attack a stationary object. Roll the Damage and compare it to the MS of the object.

**Attacking Held or Worn Items:** Occasionally, you may want to break an object held by another, such as an enemy's weapon or gadget. In such cases, you may attack with Disadvantage against the target's Avoidance. If you succeed, you damage the item, applying MS and Hits as appropriate.

**Determining Material Strength:** Refer to the Material Strength/Hits Table and Construction Qualities Table on page XX to determine an object's MS and Hits. Most objects are of Common quality. Hastily-built structures are generally of Poor construction, while objects built to withstand heavy use are generally Fine.

**Damage vulnerabilities/resistances of some materials:** Some materials would be more vulnerable or more resistant to Damage from particular damage sources; for Example, sonic attacks are very effective against items made of glass or crystal, and fire attacks against ice and wood, but that same fire attack would be less effective against a 1-hour fire rated wooded door. In these cases, at the Editor-in-chief's discretion, they may allow an attack to deal double or half Damage to an item, or they may raise/lower the MS of the item in question depending on how vulnerable or resilient the item is in question.

| Table XX Material Strength/Hits |                               |              |

Tungsteel is a Tungsten and Silicon compound that is stronger than steel.

Developed by researchers at the California Institute of Technology, DH3 Palladium Metallic Glass is one of the strongest materials ever.

### \<h3\>Might Makes Right

On occasion, you may wish to use their Strength to break objects. In that case, roll a Strength check against a DC equal to the object's hits x5 + the item's Material Strength.

For Example, the Titan must roll a successful DC: 25 (15 + 2x5) Strength Check to snap a pair of handcuffs.

**Trying Again:** Subsequent attempts on the same day suffer a cumulative -1 penalty.

## \<h2\>Lifting, Moving, and Throwing Objects

Refer to the Master Table (pg. XX and Appendix II); you may be able to push your limits after meeting a *Challenge* issued by the Editor-in-Chief or through the use of the Plot Point.

# \<h1\> Survival

*So, you think life's all about putting on a costume and protecting bystanders from zombies? Think again. We have much more to do than inflict Damage on the undead. Maybe you haven't noticed, but the big box stores and supermarkets aren't open. We've got to scrounge for what we need to survive, and we can only carry back so much.*

*God help us if the zombies ever find our enclave. Have you ever tried to move a bunch of bystanders from one enclave to the next? People don't march in groups nearly as fast as we can alone, and during all that time they're exposed to the zombies. We've got to do what we can to keep them moving.*

## \<h2\> Hunting and Gathering

Survival often comes down to who knows how to live off land, or what's left of it. Whether you're stalking game through burned-out suburbs or picking through the ruins of a strip mall, **hunting and gathering** isn't just about food, it's about keeping your people alive.

**Locating Resources:**

When heroes attempt to find food, water, salvageable gear, or critical supplies, the Editor-in-Chief may call for a Challenge using a relevant Skill Set such as: *Wilderness Survivalist, Urban Scavenger*, *Former Park Ranger, or Wasteland Courier*.

If the Skill Set applies to the environment and the task, the Hero rolls a Challenge using their Rank Bonus + Ability Modifier, with the Editor setting the DC based on conditions like scarcity, weather, danger, or local decay.

Heroes lacking an appropriate Skill Set must roll with disadvantage unless they can creatively justify experience that would apply.

**Tracking Prey:** If the Hero's Skill Set includes experience with wilderness navigation, hunting, or tracking (e.g., *Scout Sniper*, *Big Game Hunter*, *Z-Wrangler*), they may attempt to pursue animals or roaming threats.

They must describe how their Skill Set helps them follow signs such as tracks, scat, blood trails, or movement patterns, and then roll a Challenge against a DC determined by terrain, creature type, and time since the trail was fresh.

**Gathering in Urban Environments:**

In ruined cities, survival depends on your knowledge of collapsed infrastructure and human behavior. Skill Sets like *Urban Forager*, *Custodian*, *Maintenance Tech*, or *Former EMT* might help you identify where resources are hidden or where danger still lingers.

Challenges could include:

-   Safely looting unstable buildings
-   Navigating collapsed tunnels or alley mazes
-   Spotting usable materials among ruined storefronts
-   Locating medicine, batteries, or clean water

**Success and Consequences:**

Success means finding food, clean water, medicine, or even long-lost pre-Z'Day gear. Failure might mean wasting time and risking exposureâ€¦ or stumbling into something worse.

**Critical Success or Failure**: These may trigger story elements. Success might uncover a hidden safehouse or working Vehicle. A failure might alert a raider patrol, or disturb a resting Super Z.

## \<h2\>Thrust and Hunger

Heroes who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of Exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the required amount.

**Starvation:** You need one pound of food daily and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound daily counts as half a day without food.

You can go without food for several days equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, you automatically suffer one level of Exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

**Dehydration:** You need one gallon of water daily or two gallons per day if the weather is too hot. If you drink only half that much water, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of Exhaustion at the end of the day. If you have access to even less water, you automatically suffer one level of Exhaustion at the end of the day.

If you already have one or more levels of Exhaustion, you take two levels in either case.

## \<h2\>Disease

An aspect rarely touched upon in the classic superhero genre is that of disease, but not so in *Rotted Capes*. Although the threat of being infected by the Z-Virus is a constant, it's not the only disease the Heroes have to worry about.

At the onset of the disease, roll an attack against the target's *Fortitude* utilizing the disease's attack bonus*.* If it successfully hits, the target is infected and suffers the disease's initial infection effect. After the allotted time, the Hero must perform a constitution saving throw that disease's Resistance (DC); a failed roll sends the target to the next stage of infection, and so on. A successful saving throw moves the target up the track; if the target succeeds in his saving throw against the initial infection, he shakes off the disease.

Infection tracks can be 2 to 4 levels in length. The Hero only suffers Damage from any particular stage of infection once and may not heal Damage dealt by a disease until cured. Lastly, some diseases may require a specific cure; in this case, a target cannot shrug off the disease and remains in the initial infection state until the cure is administered.

Players may use Plot Points to gain Advantage on their saving throw to resist the disease, but may not use them to automatically succeed.

**Word on Antibiotics:** While most antibiotics have lost much of their potency in the years following Z-Day, they are still very useful. If a Hero has access to antibiotics when attempting to fight off a disease, they gain a +5 bonus to Constitution saving throws.

## \<h2\>Encumbrance

*Rotted Capes* assumes that Heroes are used to carrying burdens and rarely drag them into combat situations. So long as the Editor-in-Chief determines that the objects carried are reasonable, there's no need to worry about encumbrance.

A Hero walking into a supermarket with a backpack, two pistols, a shotgun, a machete, and night vision goggles is fine, but if she expects to leave with a hundred or so canned goods, then she better push a cart or load them up in an automobile.

Should the Editor-in-Chief feel that a Hero is stretching credibility, she may apply a penalty. Each gives out levels of encumbrance, with each level lowering the Hero's Pace by 1 and subtracting 1 from the Hero's Avoidance Defense and all Strength and Dexterity rolls when attempting to meet a challenge.

## \<h2\>Falling

A fall from any height can be dangerous.

For every area you fall, you suffer d8 Stamina, which may result in *massive Damage*. You land prone unless you somehow avoid taking Damage from the fall. In addition to this stamina damage, you may suffer additional wound damage if you fall far enough.

If you fall more than 3 full areas, you must make a Challenging (DC: 20) Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 wound.

If you fall a distance greater than 4 full areas, you suffer 2 wounds and must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 20 +5 for each area fallen beyond the 4th or suffer an additional 2 wounds of Damage.

When falling into the water, ignore the first Area if you may roll to meet a DC: 15 Dexterity based challenge, Appling any relevant skill sets to dive into the water, reducing the effective distance fallen by three areas.

## \<h2\>Light and Darkness

There are three levels of illumination: Bright*,* Shadowy*,* and Dark.

-   **Bright:** Full visibility. You can see details, read expressions, and fight without Penalty.
-   **Shadowy:** Low light. Shapes and movement are visible, but details are hard to make out.
-   **Dark:** No ambient light. Vision is negated unless you have a power, feature, or device that allows you to see in Darkness (such as thermal vision or night vision).

Refer to Table X-XX: Light Source Ranges for the effect radius of various lighting tools.

-   Lanterns, torches, and similar items provide Bright light in their area and Shadowy light in adjacent ones.
-   Flashlights, headlights, and spotlights are directional and only illuminate what they're aimed at.

Combat penalties and Challenge modifiers apply based on the level of illumination:

-   In Shadowy Light: You suffer -2 to attacks and to any Challenge or Attack roll where clear vision is critical.
-   In Darkness: Vision-based actions automatically fail unless the creature is making some sound that can be tracked, in which case you suffer Disadvantage to attacks and to any Challenge where clear vision is critical.

Zombies are not affected by normal lighting conditions. Their heightened senses and thermal perception allow them to track and hunt the living even in complete Darkness.

**Movement in Darkness**  
If a hero exceeds the Pace Limitation (typically more than 3 areas per Turn) while in Darkness, they must describe how one of their Skill Sets allows them to move safely under those conditions, such as *Urban Runner, Blind Warrior Monk, or Survivalist Tracker.*

-   If applicable, the Editor may call for a **DC 15 Challenge** using the appropriate Ability and Skill Set.
-   On failure, the Hero stumbles or collides with unseen hazards and falls **prone.**

## \<h2\> Rest

All living things need rest. Any character that does not get at least a Hiatus in 24 hours must attempt a DC:15 Constriction Saving Throw or gain 1 level of Exhaustion. After that, the Hero must perform an additional Constriction Saving Throw every six hours, with an ever-increasing difficulty of +5 per six hours, or involuntarily fall asleep. Recovering from this Exhausted condition requires a Hiatus. Characters may instead attempt to sleep for only 4 hours per night, postponing their Constitution saving throw to 36 hours.

If you are using the optional psychosis rules (pg xx), characters may also gain temporary levels of psychosis at the Editor's discretion; these levels of psychosis gained through lack of sleep are removed once the creature completes a Hiatus.

## \<h2\> Suffocation and Drowning

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next Turn, it drops to 0 Stamina and Wounds and is dying, and it can't regain either or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For Example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 stamina and 0 wounds.

## \<h2\>Overland Travel

While most game movement is handled during combat, there are times when players might need to know how far they have traveled during the day. Overland Travel is commonly used for long distances, such as traveling between cities or seeking out a new enclave.

**Travel and Time:** Whereas travelers on foot or horseback travel an average of 8 hours/day, vehicles can travel 24 hours, provided there are enough drivers/pilots to rotate shifts.

**Walking and Marching:** characters may walk for a total of 8 hours/day; Marching may extend the time walked for an additional number of hours up to the Hero's constitution passive modifier, but afterward, the Hero suffers a level of Exhaustion for a number of hours equal to half the additional hours matched. Heroes may continue to walk/march past their maximum time but start to suffer additional levels of Exhaustion for every 2 hours of travel. Levels of Exhaustion may not be recovered until the Hero rests for 8 hours.

**Mounted Movement:** A mount follows the same rules above, except when pushed beyond their maximum travel time per day, they may, at the editor-in-chief's discursion, become lame or suffer a crippling injury, the mount suffers a wound, and unless the Hero expends a plot point, the mount is permanently reduced to half- movement. Regardless, the mount cannot travel any further for 8 hours.

**Vehicular Movement:** Referring to the master values table, simply cross-reference the Vehicle's Pace to determine its top mph (miles per hour). This indicates the fastest speed that it can go under the best possible conditions. Many vehicles aren't designed for off-road travel; even paved roads have obstacles and deteriorating conditions. It's safe to assume that most vehicles travel between 25 â€“ 40 mph.

\<SIDE BAR\>

**\<h4\>Travel time and the story**   
As the Editor-in-Chief, you may dictate how long it takes to get from point "A "to point "B"; the rules for overland travel are simply guidelines. Of course, sometimes the true story is found in the journey, not the destination.

\<SIDE BAR\>

**Travel Conditions:** Different effects may hamper the Heroes' progress, i.e., storms, thick forests, or every sailor's nightmare, a dead calm. The Editor-in-Chief chooses a rank that best matches the conditions met during the trip and applies those modifiers to the overland speed. Only under perfect conditions will a Hero, mount, or Vehicle move at its quickest.

The Editor-in-Chief may also feel free to apply trivial conditions differently, depending upon the method of travel. While hilly terrain might be challenging for heroes on foot, it could very well be Dangerous for a sedan, and it could be perfect conditions for a hero riding a dirt bike.

| **Table: X-XX: Travel Conditions**  |               |                                                                                              |
