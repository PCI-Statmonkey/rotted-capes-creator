## Hero Creation: Making a B-Lister, one step at a time. 

Before you dive headlong into the world of rotted capes, you need to build out *who* you are playing. Were you once a scrappy sidekick to a famous hero? The bird to someone’s bat? Or were you a young, upcoming hero seeking to join a famous league of avenging heroes? Or a street-level hero looking to take down an organized crime syndicate? Or maybe you took up the mask after Z’day, hoping to find the bravery to face what lies ahead while inspiring the few survivors left.  
  
But in the end, does it all even matter after everyone was Z’d? That’s for you to decide.

Enough small talk.

Let’s get to work.

## Select an Origin 

What are you? Where do your powers come from?

Are you a Super-Human? Perhaps the next step of human evolution or the result of bioengineering or a freak accident? An alien who crash-landed on Earth and is now stranded in a strange world, struggling to survive? Or you may be an exceptionally skilled hero relying on almost superhuman abilities and superior training to win the day. Or a Tech Hero piloting a custom-designed suit of power armor or utilizing a belt full of useful, custom-made gadgetry. Or maybe your hero is a demigod, the Son of Horus, hunting down the most dangerous prey ever to walk the earth!

Each origin grants you a bonus to your starting abilities scores, Origin Features: s, and disadvantages.

## Select an Archetype 

What kind of hero are you?

Are you a powerfully built hero smashing zombie skulls with your fists and sending them flying, or do you manifest bolts of fire blasting things from afar? Maybe you’re a shadow, moving unseen? Maybe you are a quick, agile scrapper with razor-sharp claws.

Each Archetype grants you a bonus to your starting ability scores and a list of typical powers; typical powers represent your Archetype’s bailiwick but are not the only powers they can learn.

Archetypes encompass the most general of themes. Don’t be discouraged if the exact Hero you had envisioned does not fall neatly into any of these categories. Just pick the best fit and move on from there.

## Determine your ability scores. 

Your ability scores represent your hero’s attributes, how strong, fast, quick, and wise they are.

Here, you are given points to allocate across 6 ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma. After which, you apply ability score bonuses granted by both your archetypes and origin.

## Define your skill sets and pick your starting feat.

What does your hero know how to do? Maybe they will have some medical training or know their way around an old diesel engine. Here we define two Skill Sets that represent your hero’s background, training, or unique talents.

Once you’ve selected your Skill Sets, pick a starting feat that complements or enhances them. Feats are special tricks, talents, or training that give your hero an edge, whether that’s being quicker on the draw, better at jury-rigging field repairs, or a natural at reading people.

## Choose your Powers. 

So, what can your hero do? Do they have telekinetic powers? Are you an ex-super spy with training that borders on the unnatural? An ex-billionaire playboy philanthropist flying around in a suit of armor now being held together by duct tape and positive thoughts?

You get a number of points to buy your powers and determine their starting power score. Afterward, you may apply power perks and flaws, increasing or decreasing each power’s final power score.

## Do you have a weakness?

Is your hero violently allergic to a rare kind of metal? Do all your powers suddenly burn out when hit with a Sonic attack? Or maybe your hero has an uncontrollable fear of heights.

Each weakness grants you a number of Weakness Points that can be spent on bonuses. Five points grant a +1 to any ability or power score, ten points grant a feat, and fifteen points grant a feat and a +1 to any ability or power score or +2 to any two ability or power scores. If you do not want a weakness, you can skip this step.

## The Finishing Touches.

Almost there….

Here you choose your starting gear, determine your defenses, pace, starting vitality, wounds, and two of the most important details like your *character’s flaws* and your *tagline.*

## The Supporting Cast 

You’re a hero but not alone; people have a habit of following heroes. Maybe you saved them from a pack of z’s, and maybe they saved you. Regardless you are in this together.

Here you create your supporting cast, each with their skills and training. Useful? Yes, but sometimes they can be a liability, and such is the life of a hero.

# Step 1: Choose an Origin 

Your Origin defines the source of your extraordinary abilities and the means through which you achieve your heroic feats. You might be a supremely skilled hero, relying on nearly superhuman talents and rigorous training to triumph. Alternatively, you could be a Tech Hero, commanding a suit of power armor or wielding an arsenal of specially designed gadgets. Or perhaps you are a Super-Human, either the product of advanced bio-engineering or the outcome of a fateful, transformative accident, or just representing the next stage in human evolution.

Each power source grants the hero Origin Features: s and disadvantages and a bonus to a specific attribute.

Origins are not the only source of your heroes’ powers. You may have other powers gained through other means, such as being a super-human with enhanced speed and agility wielding wrist blasters made of some alien tech.

*Character creation ride-along: Step 1: choosing your Origin.*  
Ruben is a big fan of heroes who use Telekinetic powers, so he chooses to go with the super-human Origin.

Ruben sees the Super-Human Origin grant him a +2 bonus to his Constitution. Additionally, he notes his *Raw Potential* Foundation Feature, as well as noting his Foundation Limitations *Power Limits.*  
  
Nani is a particular fan of Norse mythology, so she chooses to go with a demigod.

Nani sees that the Demi-God Origin grants her a +1 bonus to any two ability scores or a +2 bonus to one. She chooses +1 to Strength and Constitution and looks at her Foundation Feature, “*Divine Blood, Divine Power”* which has three options, and she decides to go with *Divine Presence.* After which, she notes Foundation Limitation: *Divine power limits.*

\</side bar\>

## Alien

You are not of this world. Whether you hail from a distant planet, are a member of an extraterrestrial race, or from another dimension, your origins lie beyond. Your alien nature grants you unique abilities and perspectives that set you apart from humanity.

Perhaps you arrived on Earth as an ambassador of your people, or maybe you were stranded here, your spacecraft damaged beyond repair, forcing you to adapt to survive. Regardless of the circumstances, you are now a stranger in a strange land, facing the dual challenges of the zombie apocalypse and the mysteries of this new world.

Your alien heritage brings both advantages and challenges. You may possess advanced technology, telepathic abilities, or physical attributes beyond human limits. However, you also grapple with the struggle of finding your place among humans, building trust, and understanding their customs and culture.  
  
**Ability Score Bonus:**

As an Alien, you might possess enhanced physiology or a significantly advanced mind

+2 to one of the following (your choice): Strength, Intelligence, or Wisdom

**Origin Foundation Feature:  **
*Your mind processes data in strange, nonlinear ways.*

You may reroll any failed Intelligence-based Skill Set challenge, recovering the ability to do so after completing a Hiatus (must keep the new result).

Additionally, you gain a passive bonus: you can read or decipher alien or unknown languages if you have context clues or time to observe. (This is not an instant translation, more like narrative-level Rosetta Stone intuition.)

**Origin Limitations:  **
*Cultural Misfit:* You have Disadvantage with all initial social interactions with non-Bystanders who know you're alien unless you have earned their trust.

*Stranger on Earth:* During character creation, if you possess Earth-based Skill Sets (e.g., Streetwise, Black-Market Runner), you may not begin with gain any Edge with that skill set

**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

#### A-Lister Rank Origin Features

> **Cosmic Beacon**: Your alien presence emits a unique cosmic energy that can empower or disrupt other beings. Once per scene, as a bonus action, when within 2 areas of another powered creature, you may modify the power score of any of their abilities by +2 or -2 until the end of their next turn.

Any object you kit bash in this way lasts until the end of the scene, at which point it deactivates, melts down, or burns out. You regain the use of this ability after completing a Hiatus.

## Android

You are some form of mechanical creation, be it a self-aware robot, an artificially-constructed human, or even a human brain in a cybernetic body. You have an inorganic makeup and are relatively immune to most diseases. Making you a *very* valuable member of any enclave. However, that said….

\<side bar\>

Editor’s Note:  
Being immune to infection may make the Android *too* effective for the zombie apocalypse. You may want to consider the possibility of a machine-based virus allowing for mechanical zombies. See “Zombies and Non-Humans,” p. XX, for more options.

\</side bar\>

**Ability Score Bonus:**

Androids might be diverse in their design and programming parameters, but it is their digital minds that make it all possible. You gain +2 to your Intelligence score.

**Origin Foundation Feature:  **
*Modular Redundancy:* Your systems are layered with fail-safes and backups.

- You may reroll one failed Constitution or Dexterity saving throw per Issue, reflecting your ability to reroute power or reinforce structure.

**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

**Adaptive Modifications:** Increase your Intelligence score and another ability score of your choice by 1. You may take this feature multiple times.

> **Data Analysis:** Choose one Skill Set related to data processing or tactical analysis (e.g., Tactician, Strategist, Technophile, or Scholar). You may define a specialized Edge within that Skill Set related to analyzing data, spotting patterns, or predicting outcomes.
>
> Additionally, once per scene, you may ask the Editor-in-Chief to reveal a hidden clue, weakness, or tactical insight related to a scene, creature, or problem, as long as your hero has had at least a moment to observe or review information. The Editor should provide a hint or detail that rewards your logical interpretation.

**Enhanced Capabilities:** Increase the power score of any two of your inborn powers by 1. You may take this feature multiple times.

**Self-Repair:** Your android body can repair itself over time. When you heal a wound, you heal two instead.

#### A-Lister Rank Origin Features

**Combat Computer:** As a bonus action, you can dedicate most of your processing power to your combat computer, allowing it to take control. While in your combat computer is active, the following benefits apply for 1 minute:

- *Wired Reflexes:* You gain advantage on all attack rolls.

- *Precision:* Your attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage of the same type.

- *Telemetry Data:* you gain a +1 bonus to your Avoidance.

You gain the Wireless power at a power score equal to your Intelligence score. If you already have the wireless power, increase your power score in that power by +4 if the score is higher than your intelligence score.

**Tactical Combat Records:** After fighting a creature type or individual for 2 rounds, you gain a +1 bonus to hit and a +1 bonus to your defenses when facing them. You may retain data on as many creatures as your intelligence bonus.

## Cosmic

You can tap into and channel the energies that permeate the universe. How you gained these powers is up to you, but you might possess an alien artifact that draws upon such energies or may someone have granted you these powers to help keep law and order in this small section of the universe. However, despite your origin, you’re still a B-Lister and only possess a fraction of the power cosmically enhanced A-Listers can sling around. In other words, no flying through space unaided, defending entire solar systems all by yourself, or destroying starships with a single energy blast. And worse yet, you’re now trapped in a world overrun by the living dead. Your starship may be damaged, your interstellar flight ring has gone missing, or with your mentor gone, you have sworn to eradicate the zombie threat in their memory.

The reason doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you’re in for the long haul and are here to stay.

**Ability Bonus:**  
Comic beings come in many shapes, but the rigors of being a vessel for such power demand a level of durability. You gain +1 to your Constitution and one other ability score of your choice.

**Origin Foundation Feature:  **
*Singularity of Power:* Your energy source is vast but contained, a star-forged battery, an extradimensional core, or the will of a celestial entity. It defines you completely.

- Choose one of your powers. This power becomes your **Core Power**.

- You gain a +2 bonus to the Power Score of your **Core Power**.

- Additionally, you gain Advantage on any Power checks directly involving your Core Power’s effects.

**Origin Limitations:**

*Power Limits:* At hero creation, all your powers must share the same energy source. If the source of your cosmic powers is an item, then all your powers must be part of that object, and all share the same burnout threshold. After hero creation, you can only gain new inborn powers through mastering emulated powers based on your existing inborn powers.

Later, with Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may acquire new powers, but none of them can be Inborn powers; they must be made available through technology, supernatural, or some other external source. Certain story-based events, such as exposure to a nuclear reactor, massive amounts of solar radiation, or other such esoteric energies, *may* allow you to acquire new inborn powers.

**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
|-----------------------------------|
| Cosmic Adaptation                 |
| Cosmic Awareness                  |

| Cosmic Evolution                  |

| Infinite Cosmic Power             |
| Power Mastery                     |
| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
| Cosmic Entanglement               |
| Cosmic Transformation             |
| Stellar Manipulation              |

#### B-Lister Level Origin Features 

**Cosmic Adaptation:** Adapt to various environments and conditions in space, such as extreme temperatures or lack of oxygen. You gain the power of Life Support: 40. This power is limited to space, allowing you to exist and operate in the extreme temperatures and vacuum of space.

**Cosmic Awareness:** Your connection to the cosmos grants you heightened senses and the ability to detect hidden threats or sources of power. You can sense the use of cosmic-based powers or events within a number of miles equal to your wisdom bonus. You can gauge the general power level classification of the cosmic event with a successful Wisdom Check vs. a DC: 20, -5 for each power level classification above Gamma, so gauging a Theta level event would require a DC 5 Charisma Check.

**Cosmic Ascendance:** Increase the power score of any two of your cosmic powers by +1. You may take this feature multiple times.

> **Cosmic Evolution:** Increase your Constitution score and another ability score of your choice by 1. You may take this feature multiple times.

**Cosmic Resistance:** You have DR 1 vs. cosmic-based attacks and effects, stacks with other effects. You may choose this feature more than once, gaining a +1 each additional time you take this feature to a maximum of +5.

**Infinite Cosmic Power:** Increase your burnout threshold by 2

**Power Mastery:** Choose a power feat.

#### A-Lister Level Origin Features

**Cosmic Entanglement:** All cosmic-level heroes tap into the same reserves. You have learned how to manipulate the flow of the cosmic, empowering or disempowering those around you that tap into that power. Once per scene, as a bonus action, when within 2 areas of another cosmic-powered creature, you may modify the power score of any of their Cosmic themed powers by +2 or -2 until the end of their next turn.

**Cosmic Transformation:** Tapping into the cosmic power, you unleash your true potential and undergo a temporary transformation. You can activate Cosmic Transformation as a bonus action. While in your cosmic form, the following benefits apply for 1 minute:

- *Advantage on Attacks:* You gain advantage on all attack rolls.

- *Resilience:* You have advantage on all saving throws and ability checks.

- *Cosmic Overcharge:* Choose one of your cosmic powers, and that power’s score is increased by +4

> After using this feature, you wait 1 week before using it again. You may retake this feature when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category, reducing the time between uses to a Hiatus.

**Stellar Manipulation:** Harness the power of stars to unleash devastating energy attacks. You gain the Energy Manipulation (Cosmic) power with a power score equal to your Charisma score. If you already have the Energy Manipulation (Cosmic) power, increase your power score in that power by +4 if the score is higher than your Charisma score.

## Demigod

You are a ‘divine’ being. Or at least you claim to be. It is possible you’re the result of the union between a god and a mortal, or you may be the avatar of such a being, sent to Earth to work its will. Before Z-Day, other superheroes figured you were either a powerful alien, a deluded mutant, another form of superhuman, a visitor from another dimension, or a walking example of ‘any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.’ After Z-Day, all that mattered was that you were alive and could deal with the zombie threat.

**Ability Bonus:**  
Demigods are as different as the deities of the varied pantheons; you get a +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice or +1 to any two ability scores of your choice.

**Origin Foundation Feature:**

*Divine Blood, Divine Power:*

You carry the spark of divinity, whether it manifests as strength, presence, or foresight, depends on your lineage. Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Mighty Lineage:** You possess incredible strength, allowing you to lift and carry heavy objects easily. Your strength score is doubled to determine how much you can lift, carry, or drag. You also have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.

- **Divine Presence:** You gain Advantage on all social Skill Set challenges when interacting with mortals who recognize your divine heritage (fear, awe, or reverence).

- **Prophetic Insight:** Once per Issue, when you fail a d20 roll, you may declare you foresaw this outcome and reroll the die. You must accept the new result.

**Origin Foundation Limitations:**

*Divine Power Limits:* After character creation, at least half of your powers must be Inborn Powers, with all other powers being tied to one supernatural object. You can only gain new inborn powers through mastering emulated powers based on your existing inborn powers.

Later, with Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may acquire new powers, but none of them can be Inborn powers; they must be made available through technology, supernatural, or some other external source. Of course, certain story-based events tied to your Demigod’s mythological theme may allow you to gain new inborn powers.

**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

**Divine Blessing:** The gods smile upon you, granting you a permanent boon. Choose one of the following benefits: +1 bonus to avoidance, +1 grit, or +1 to all attack rolls. This benefit cannot be changed once chosen.

**Divine Bloodline:** Increase the ability score or scores modified by your origin during hero creation by 2 or 1, respectively. You may take this feature multiple times. For example, if you choose to increase Strength by +2 during hero creation, you gain a +2 to strength when choosing this feature.

**Divine Presence:** Your presence exudes an aura of power and authority, influencing the behavior of others and benefiting in social interactions. You gain a +2 bonus when attempting to meet a challenge to influence others. You may take this feature multiple times, gaining a +1 each additional time you take this feature to a maximum of +5.

**Divine Sense:** Your connection to the divine allows you to sense the presence of undead creatures. As a bonus action, you can detect the location of any undead within 30 feet, even through walls and obstacles.

- *Advantage on Attacks:* You gain advantage on all attack rolls.

- *Divine Weaponry:* When attacking with a weapon or unarmed attack, once per turn, you deal an additional 1d6 damage.

> After using this feature, you wait 1 week before using it again. You may retake this feature when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category, reducing the time between uses to a Hiatus.

**Divine Resistance:** Your divine heritage grants you resistance to a specific damage type associated with your divine parentage. Choose one damage type (e.g., fire, lightning, necrotic) and gain DR 2 against that damage type. You may take this feature multiple times, gaining a +1 each additional time you take this feature to a maximum of +5.

## Highly Trained 

Yes, it was hard for you to make a name for yourself; you can’t fly, dodge bullets, or build a battle suit that would have allowed you to face down the likes of the Raptor or Inferno, but what you lacked in raw power you more than made up for in hard earned skill.

At one time, you may have been a highly trained field agent for the NSA or The Division, or maybe you were a uniquely gifted martial artist trained in almost forgotten techniques by a solitary master, or perhaps you were a rich millionaire utilizing almost limitless resources, ruthless training, and an unbreakable will to forge yourself into more than an ordinary man.

Regardless of how you trained your body to become the hero you are today, you face a threat you could have never foreseen. And you thought you had it hard when your enemies were breathing…

**Ability Bonus:** Skill-based heroes are a varied lot; they gain a +1 bonus to any three attributes of their choice.

**Origin Foundation Features:**

*My knowledge is my power:* Once you reach step 4 during hero creation, you get to choose an additional feat or an additional skill set.

**Origin Foundation Limitation:**

*Only Human:* You are ultimately only human; you may never increase your physical attributes (before applying powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.

*No Powers:* You do not possess any inborn powers; therefore, any power must be skill-based or the result of specialized equipment. Powers marked with a (\*) in Archetypes and later in the Powers section may be attributed to specialized training. If you choose these as powers, they must possess the *All-Skill* Power Modification. Any other powers are the result of custom technology; thus, they require the External Power Source and either *Cybernetic Implants* or *Removable Item* Power Modifications.

**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
|-----------------------------------|
| Acrobatic Mastery                 |
| Advanced Training                 |

This feature may be taken multiple times.

**Skill Mastery:** Choose one of your Skill Sets. Whenever you use your chosen skill set to meet a challenge, you gain an additional +1 to die roll.

> You may take this feature multiple times, improving this bonus by +1 to a maximum of +3
>
> **Cross Training:** Choose an additional skill set. You only apply half your rank bonus to all rolls involving this skill set. All edges under this skill set gain your full rank bonus, instead of double.

## Mystic

You are one of the rarest heroes, a mystic arts practitioner, or a mystic power wielder. You might be a magician calling ancient powers and bending them to your will, or an ancient artifact may have chosen you to wield its power for a greater purpose, or a master of mystical gadgetry.

Before Z-Day, you may have used your knowledge to fight crime under the guise of a stage magician, acted as a private investigator of the occult, or defended the Earth from extradimensional invaders. You may have even taken to wearing a colorful costume and fighting alongside more traditional (at least in the public mind) heroes. In any event, you were considered an oddity, even among the other heroes. Scientists may try to quantify your power source, while others would dismiss your claims as theater to invoke your heroic persona. But after Z-Day, does it matter anymore? Depending on the cause of the Zombie Apocalypse chosen by the Editor, you may be one of the people best equipped to deal with the apocalypse. Zombies (and other forms are undead) are often par for the course for many mystic masters.

The problem here, however, is that there are so many zombies. More unsettling is the silence that has settled onto the supernatural side of the world. You would have thought the deaths of so many would have caused an increase in apparitions and ghosts of the world. Instead, there is an uneasy quiet. In addition, you can now “feel” the waves of mystic power far more quickly than before as it flows readily through you. It is so accessible that you’d think it was building itself up in anticipation, but for what?

### Superheroic Sorcery

At first glance, superheroes and sorcery may seem like an odd mix, but magic-using and magic-powered superheroes date back to the first costumed crime fighters. Thus, when playing *Rotted Capes,* you and the Editor-in-Chief must consider the nature of magic and magical characters in your campaign.

For starters, superheroic magicians tend to look and dress differently than your typical costumed crime fighter. Skin-tight costumes tend to be reasonably rare, replaced with trench coats, tunics, top hats, capes and cloaks, and so on. And even if they wear a skin-tight costume, the superheroic sorcerer tends to have or use some distinctive artifact that marks them as a magician, such as an enchanted helmet, a “spell sword,” or a power-channeling staff. Finally, such heroes also have codenames that reflect the nature of their powers. For example, there are a *lot* of Doctors slinging spells in the comics.

Next, we need to consider the nature of superheroic spellcasting. Much of it tends to be akin to *thaumaturgy* or “wonder-working.” In other words, comic book magicians work miracles through their spells and spellcraft. However, very few comic book magicians cast their spells the same way as other magicians. Usually, each hero has a specific technique for creating their magical effects. Some speak their spells backward, saying “tlob gninthgil!” when they want to produce a bolt of electricity. Others use alliterative phrasing, calling upon “hoary hosts” and the like.

Still, others channel their magic through specific objects, such as wands, the aforementioned enchanted helmet, or amulets. By determining this, you start to bring your hero to life and differentiate them from regular costumed supers and other magically-powered characters. That said, first check with your Editor-in-Chief to see if he has any specific ideas on how magic works in his game. He may give you his outlines for spells or, better yet, might take your ideas and adopt them whole cloth.

Once you know how you cast spells, you need to decide what your spells look like. As comics are a visual medium, comic book super mages tend to have showy side effects to their spells. When creating magic, their hands are often surrounded by such effects as great globes of light, bands or rings, elaborate mandalas, or intricate patterns of lines. Magical artifacts glow when used, often with unusual or unnatural colors.

Combat spells tend to go beyond the “mundane” energy/ element blasts of regular superheroes. They may manifest as a multitude of energy darts, a burning animal shape, or any number of similar effects. Defensive spells often spark or shine when struck or radiate the same effects mentioned when creating spells if an attack hits home.

Another thing to consider is that, unlike regular superheroes, super mages aren’t manipulating real-world energies. They’re working with magical energies, which means they can do things in highly unconventional ways. For example, a regular superhero may perform a Geospatial Shift by traveling at super speed, manipulating time, or converting their mass to energy and back again. On the other hand, a super mage may cut a rift in the “veil between worlds,” shift from our world to a different dimension, and then back, or simply will themselves there. These kinds of effects apply to *everything* a superheroic magician can do and go hand-in-hand with the idea that superheroic spell casting needs to be showy and visually distinct.

Of course, in a zombie apocalypse, showy spell casting might *not* be the best of ideas, as it might draw unwanted attention to you and your companions, but that’s the price you pay for mastery of the mystic arts.

\</Side Bar\>

**There are three basic types of mystic heroes:**

*Practitioners* are the magi, the wielders of magic. These heroes derive their powers through mystical rituals requiring an almost inhuman dedication.

*The Chosen* are those heroes who have been blessed by either mystical beings from beyond the planes of man or those who have been chosen by a powerful magical item that empowers them with their abilities.

*Enchanters* are those heroes who come at magic differently, sometimes called *mystic gadgeteers.* These heroes create fantastic instruments which are cable of doing fantastic things.

### Practitioners

**Ability Bonus:**

*Practitioners* get where they are through constant study and self-Willpower, which allows them a +2 to their Charisma score.

**Origin Foundation Features:**

*Bell, Book, and Candle:* To represent your training in the mystic arts, you choose *Occult Arcanist* as one of your skill sets, and you also gain the *Occult Scholar* feat for free.

*Unseen Truths*: The mystic arts reveal things beyond mortal understanding; secrets etched into the bones of the world. Whether through ritual, trance, cards, stars, or whispers in the dark, you can ask the universe for guidance.

Once per Issue, you may perform a short ritual (as simple as muttering a chant, reading a sign, or casting runes) to ask the Editor-in-Chief a question about the current situation, creature, or threat. The Editor must answer with either:

- A concrete truth,

- A useful hint, or

- A cryptic omen tied to your question.

Additionally, when making any Skill Set check related to the supernatural, arcane, divine, or cursed objects/forces, you gain Advantage if you have time to perform a minor ritual or speak with spirits/entities before acting.

**Origin Foundation Limitation:**

*Only Human:* Despite your mystic Might, you’re ultimately only human; you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before the application of powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.

*Gremlins:* All mystic heroes seem to have problems with technology; mystic heroes gain Gremlins as an additional personality flaw. Your editor-in-chief may activate this flaw to refuse its effects; you must spend a plot point.

*Spell Slinger:* As a wielder of the mystic arts, you do not possess powers, but rather cast spells. When choosing a power, it is instead considered a spell and must have the Magical Spell perk (see page xx). Spells that you have memorized or otherwise know are considered inborn powers. All other spells must have the removable flaw, such as being written in a tome or linked to an object that could be lost mid-battle.

### Enchanters 

**Ability Bonus:**

*Enchanters* see the world in ways others cannot even imagine; thus, they gain +2 to their Intelligence score.

**Origin Foundation Features:**

*Mystech Artificer:* You fuse ritual magic with engineering, enchanting everyday items into arcane tools of power. Whether you're a run-slinger, wand-hacker, or sigil-plumber, your creations run on your soul.

- During hero creation, you must choose *Arcane Engineer* (or a similar themed) Skill Set as one of your starting Skill Sets.

- Once per Issue, you may declare that you’ve pre-enchanted a mundane item on your person, imbuing it with a single use of any known power you possess. If you use this item, you use the power imbued into the item but do so without retaining any burnout for the power use, destroying the item's enchantment

- Additionally, during your Enclave Interlude, you can repair or replace any one of your lost or broken magical items that possessed powers through the removable item flaw. Alternately, at the editor-in-chief’s discretion, you may repair or replace such a magical item possessed by an ally.

**Origin Foundation Limitations:**

*Only Human:* Despite your mystic might, you’re ultimately only human; you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before applying powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.

*So many Toys:* Your powers come from multiple pieces of equipment that share one power source: you. During hero creation, all your powers must result from items; as such, your powers cannot have the external power source power modifications and must possess the Removable Item power modification (fully explained under powers pg. XX). Additionally, you may learn the Inventive Gadgetry power, but items created using this power do not have an external power source or modification. Instead, they tap into your arcane power; as such, you pay the burnout cost when activating the item's power.

*Techno-Shaman:* Technology reaches out for you. Unexplained technological phenomenon springs up wherever you go. You might be able to work wonders with a computer, but that computer is just as likely to turn on you. Beware, for there are ghosts in the machine who are hungry for someone like you, someone attuned to their world. Your editor-in-chief may activate this flaw; you may refuse its effects, but to do so, you must spend a plot point.

### The Chosen

**Ability Bonus:**

*The Chosen* are typically selected because they possess an unorthodox way of seeing things; thus, they gain +2 to their Wisdom score.

**Origin Foundation Features:**

*Marked by Destiny:* You are the chosen vessel of a force far beyond you, a cosmic balance, a slumbering god, a relic forged for a forgotten war. Whether you embrace or resist your fate, you are never truly alone.

- You gain a +1 bonus to your Grit.

- Once per Issue, when you would be reduced to 0 Stamina or suffer a Wound, you may instead call upon your fate. You remain at 1 Stamina or negate the Wound and immediately gain enough Burnout to meet your burnout threshold or that of your bonded magical item (see set path below)

**Origin Foundation Flaws:**

*Only Human:* Despite your mystic might, you’re ultimately only human; you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before the application of powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.

*A Set Path:* At character creation, you must choose one of the following:

- **Bound Artifact:** All of your powers originate from a specific item you possess (e.g., a magic sword, book, or relic). These powers must have the External Power Source power modification.

- **Mystic Patron:** Your powers are granted by a supernatural patron (e.g., a god, demon, ancestor, cosmic force). These powers must have the Patron power modification.

*Power Limits:* After hero creation you may only learn new powers through *emulating* them from your known powers, and you may also learn new powers by applying the *all skill* modification representing advanced physical training.

**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

## Super-Human 

You may have been born with your powers, seeing them develop over time, or be a result of scientific experimentation. Perhaps you were one of those rare Super- Humans resulting from a “lucky accident,” simply in the right place at the wrong time, triggering what has been referred to as the Ultra-Gene.

Before Z-Day, all you had to worry about were “super-villains” or ‘Gene purists”. However, with Z-Day has come a disturbing phenomenon: some Super-Humans who possessed the Ultra gene do not simply become zombies, but twisted malign versions of themselves, with all ability to tell right from wrong erased from their psyche.

>

## Supernatural

You are possibly the strangest form of costumed hero—a supernatural being. You may be the ghost of someone slain before Z-Day (or *after*), the physical manifestation of some aspect of the natural world, a heroic vampire who fights the urge to drink the blood of the living, or someone infected with lycanthropy, assuming the form of a bear, tiger, wolf or other beast at will.

Before Z-Day, you almost certainly operated from the shadows, fighting criminals and other menaces without drawing too much attention to yourself. If you belonged to a super team, you avoided the spotlight and tended to be somewhat cryptic about your origins and nature. Now, *after* Z-Day, you are conflicted. You can certainly use your powers to help the scattered enclaves and survivors, but will they accept your help? Or will they look at you as just another zombie?

## Techno Hero

Back during the “Glory Days” you did well for yourself, using either your superior intellect or impressive resources to create your heroic persona. You might have a suit of power armor once designed for military applications, maybe you made a new scientific breakthrough, or you might just be an exceptional archer with a quiver of specialized arrows and the ability to scavenge like no other.

Back when you had a workshop you were always able to keep your gear in tip top shape, but after everything fell apart you were lucky to have power, let alone a high-powered plasma cutter. Now you simply make do, find what you can, make it work, and move on. What other choice do you have?

- Between issues, during your Enclave Interlude, you can repair or replace any one of your lost or broken items that possessed powers through the removable item flaw. Alternately, at the editor-in-chief’s discretion, you may repair or replace a technological item possessed by an ally.

*Always one step ahead:  *
Once per Issue, when one of your items is lost or destroyed, you may declare that you had a backup device or upgrade prepared in advance. As a Demanding Action, you can quickly assemble or activate this backup to replace the lost item. However, the device is flawed due to rushed deployment:

- Any powers granted by the replacement item are treated as if they have a Power Score of -2.

- All such powers suffer +2 additional Burnout when used.

- The backup item remains operational until the end of the Issue, after which it becomes unstable, unusable, or must be rebuilt during your next Enclave Interlude.

**Origin Foundation Limitation:**

*Only Human:* You are ultimately only human; you may never increase your base physical ability scores (before the application of powers such as Enhanced Ability scores) beyond 20.

*Self-Made Hero:* All your powers must be derived from technology. Unless granted through Manifest Gear or Inventive Gadgetry, every power you possess must include one of the following Power Modifications:

- All-Skill

- Cybernetic Implant

- Removable Item

- Power Armor

In addition, any power that uses a Cybernetic Implant or Removable Item must also include the External Power Source modification, representing the tech’s dependence on energy systems, batteries, or infrastructure.

**Origin Advancement Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels you will be granted Origin Features. When you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |

#### B-Lister Level Origin Features 

**A Sharp Mind:** Your mind is sharper than most. Increase your wisdom or intelligence score by +2 or both by +1; you may choose this option multiple times.

**Always Learning:** You may define one Edge for each Skill Set you possess.

> The Editor-in-Chief must approve each Edge and should reflect a unique application of that Skill Set (e.g., “*I just understand weapon systems*” or “*master of field repair*”).

**Analytical Mind:** Your engineering precision borders on the superhuman.

> Choose a Skill from a Skill Set you possess that relates to technology, diagnostics, invention, or analysis (e.g., “Jury Rigging” in Engineer, or “Reverse Engineering” in Arcane Engineer).
>
> You may define a unique Edge related to that Skill, such as:
>
> *“Always knows what’s wrong with a machine.”*
>
> *“Can analyze any system in seconds.”*
>
> *“Never makes the same mistake twice.”*
>
> Once per Issue, when using this Edge, you may roll with advantage.

**Hardened Energy Source:** Increase the burnout threshold any of your external power sources by 2

**Just a few Adjustments:** Increase the power score of any of your pieces of technology by +2

**Hacking Savant:** You don’t just crack systems, you dominate them.

- You may define an Edge tied specifically to digital intrusion, remote access, or system overrides.

- Once per Issue, when using this Edge to infiltrate a system, override technology, or exploit digital security, you may ignore one obstacle, security layer, or penalty the Editor-in-Chief would normally impose (e.g., "You bypass the biometric lock without needing the admin hand").

> **Technological Mastery:** You have proficiency with technological devices and can attempt to interface with them even if you lack the necessary credentials or access codes. You gain a +5 bonus to all Intelligence checks related to analyzing or understanding technology.

#### A-Lister Level Origin Features 

*Technological Precision:* You understand how machines think, and more importantly, how they break.

Once per scene, you may attempt an Intelligence-based Skill Set Challenge to identify weaknesses in a mechanical or technological enemy (such as a robot, construct, or powered armor suit). This challenge uses an appropriate Skill Set (e.g., Engineer, Arcane Engineer, or Technophile).

The base Difficulty Class (DC) is 15, modified by relative power level:

- +2 for each category above your own Power Level Classification

- –2 for each category below your own

> If successful, you gain a +2 bonus for all attack rolls against that target for the remainder of the scene, as you exploit identified vulnerabilities.

**Kit-Bashing/McGyvering:** You can quickly kit bash technology on the fly as long as you have some raw materials to work with. You gain Dynamic Power at a power score equal to your intelligence score. If you already possess this power, you gain another instance of this power instead. Any power you manifest through this version of Dynamic Power must have an external energy source and be a removable object. Any object you create ceases to function at the end of the scene.

**Overdrive:** You can push your technology far beyond its design parameters. As a bonus action, roll a 2d6 and add that result to the Burnout Threshold of one of your external power sources, and have half the amount rolled to the power score of one of your powers that tap into that power source. These bonuses last for 1 minute, after which you must wait 1 week before using this feature again.

# Step 2: Choose Your Archetype 

Archetypes encompass the most general of themes; don’t be discouraged if the exact Hero you had envisioned does not fall neatly into any of these categories. Just pick the best fit and move on from there.

When you choose an Archetype, you gain a bonus to a particular attribute and a list of Typical Powers*.*

**Typical Powers** list of suggested powers for your Archetype. These are merely suggestions that fit your chosen Archetype.

All powers marked with a \* may be acquired as a skill-based power, utilizing the All-Skill power modification (see pg. XX).

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride-along: Archetypes*  
Ruben continues with his concept. Ruben goes with the Controller, and Nani goes with the brawler.

Ruben notes that the controller grants him either a +1 bonus to Wisdom or Charisma. He chooses charisma and selects Honeyed Tongue as his bonus feat.

Nani chooses to build a Heavy, which grants him either a +1 Strength or Charisma. Nani goes with +1 to strength, then chooses Weapon Master as her bonus feat

\</side bar\>

## Blaster 

You excel at blasting people from a distance, but that’s not to say that you are helpless when cornered in melee! You prefer to use your powers to punish at a distance… a handy attribute when being faced down by a pack of zombies or fighting super zombies without range powers.

**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Dexterity or Charisma

**Marksman:** You gain *Hawkeye* as a free feat

**Blaster Typical Powers:** Adsorb Energy, Damaging Form, Energy Blast, Energy Explosion, Energy Generation, Energy Manipulation, Energy Sheath, Enhanced Ability Score (Dexterity)\*, Flight, Force Field, Force Shield, Psychic Attack.

**\<Sidebar\>**

###  Legacy Archetype: The Andromorph

In the first edition of Rotted Capes, Andromorphs were introduced as their own Archetype, beings of fluid identity and form, able to shift gender, appearance, and sometimes even biology at will. But in Rotted Capes 2nd Edition, this concept has been reimagined.

Rather than being a single rigid Archetype or Origin, Andromorph works better as a narrative overlay, a form, not a source of power. An Andromorph could just as easily be a shape-changing mystic, a gene-hacked Super-Human, or a disguised android. What matters isn’t how they shift, but that they do.

**Gameplay Note:**  
If you want to play an Andromorph, work with your Editor-in-Chief to flavor your Origin, Powers, or Feats accordingly. Shapechange, Power Emulation, and Dynamic Form are all excellent ways to model this concept mechanically.

\</Sidebar\>

## Brawler 

You like to get into the thick of it! While some people used to call you reckless, its nothing compared to the levels of recklessness you have displayed after Z-Day. You get in the midst of the action, right there between the chattering teeth and ripping claws… right where you like it.

**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution

**Scrapper:** You gain your choice between the martial arts feat and the weapon master feat.

**Typical Powers:** Armor, Bestial Transformation, Endurance\*, Enhanced Attack\*, Enhanced Ability Score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) \*, Enhanced Senses, Force Field. Personal, Invulnerability, Regeneration, Resistance, Super-Sense.

## Controller 

You may be a telepath or telekinetic or might even know how to control the weather. Put simply, you have the ability to control something or someone... As a telepath, you have survived by wit and guile by “convincing” others to fight for you, or finding an enclave to take you in. As a kinetic of any kind, you have just learned to crush or throw Zombies out of your way.

**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Wisdom or Charisma

**Manipulator:** You gain either the Empathic Intuition or Honeyed Tongue as a bonus feat.

**Typical Powers:** Animate Object, Botanokinesis, Control Weather, Darkness, Gravity Control, Emotion Control, Entangle, Mind Control, Move Object, Nullify, invulnerability (psychic), Power Boost, Sixth Sense\*, Sympathy, Telepathy, Weaken.

## Infiltrator 

Most people refer to your type as ‘ghosts’; always slipping in, out, or through and always one step ahead of trouble. Perhaps you can walk through walls or disappear; these are very handy abilities, especially after Z-Day.

**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Dexterity or Intelligence

**Ghost: You** gain the Stealthy feat for free

**Typical Powers:** Adoptive Muscle Memory\*, Catfall\*, Darkness, Eidetic Memory, Endurance\*, Enhanced Sense\*, Illusion, Incorporeal, Invisibility, Luck\*, Manifest Gear\*, Surge\*, Swinging, Wall Crawl\*, Wireless.

## Heavy 

*Some people refer to heaves as “shakers” because when they throw down, people feel it blocks away.*

On the surface, you have a lot in common with brawlers, but it’s the way you bring down your foes that makes you different. Your skin is tougher, you’re stronger, and bigger… much bigger. You’re the guy people hide behind. You are a wall, turning to face an oncoming horde.

**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Strength or Constitution

**Heavy Duty:** You gain either Toughness or Large as a bonus feat.

**Typical Powers:** Adsorb Matter, Armor, Bestial Transformation, Density Control, Endurance\*, Enhanced Attack\*, Enhanced Ability Score (Strength or Constitution)\*, Enhanced Senses, Force Field. Personal, Growth, Invulnerability, Regeneration, Resistance, Super-Sense.

## Transporter 

You possess the ability to move from place to place with ease. Perhaps you’re a flyer or a speedster, or the rarest of Transporters: a Teleporter.

You have done well, keeping one step ahead of the Z’d Supers; most can’t even touch you. Perhaps to those you help protect, you have become the best bait, always drawing the zombies where they are most effectively dealt with. Or maybe you are a blur of motion, taking down zombies in the midst of a fight where you do the most good.

**Ability Bonus:** +1 to Dexterity or Wisdom

**In and Out:** You gain either the Quick or Increased Burnout feat for free.

**Typical Powers:** Celerity\*, Enhanced Ability Score (Dexterity, Wisdom, Constitution), Flight, Geospatial Shift,

Invisibility, Portal, Speed\*, Surge\*, Teleport, Temporal Fugue, Tunnel, Wall Crawl.

# Step 3: Determine Ability Scores 

Ability scores measure your hero’s physical and mental characteristics, such as how smart, quick, or witty they are. There are 6 Ability Scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. A hero’s defenses; vitality, wounds, pace, and number of starting skills all rely on these ability scores. These scores are your baseline scores before the application of any powers, if any.

Where the common bystander generally possesses scores of 8 to 10 in most attributes, a B-Lister’s attributes can range anywhere from 8 to 18. Some heroes are exceptionally powerful in a single attribute, which is augmented through powers; even these B-Listers' highest score generally stays in the low 20s. Refer to the *Ability and Power Scores Values Table*

- Strength

> *Your ability to apply your raw strength to tasks. Strength represents your muscles and physical power. Strength is vital for heroes who rely on hard-hitting attacks.*

- May be used to determine your Fortitude Defense (see pg xx)

- Modifies your damage in melee and with thrown weapons.

- How much you can lift and carry.

- Skill checks and attribute checks where an application force is required.

<!-- -->

- Dexterity

> *The measure of your reflexes and foot speed, Dexterity is critical to those who rely upon agility and speed to get out of trouble. Dexterity is especially valuable when fleeing from bands of zombies.*

- May be used to determine your Avoidance Defense (see pg. xx).

- Determines your base initiative bonus

- Determines your pace (see pg xx)

- Skill checks and ability checks where reflexes are called into question.

<!-- -->

- Constitution

> *The measurement of your health and vitality, the Constitution is very important to Heroes who need to endure in the face of harsh physical punishment, either from arduous labor or combat.*

- May be used to determine your Fortitude Defense (see pg xx)

- Determines your Wounds (pg xx)

- Skill checks and ability checks where endurance is tested.

<!-- -->

- Intelligence

> *Your reasoning ability and overall smart, Intelligence are crucial to those who have academic pursuits and need to reason their way through problems. Intelligence is also useful to scientific Heroes, especially when trying to make things work.*

- May be used to determine your Avoidance Defense (see pg XX)

- Skill checks and ability checks when called upon to make conclusions based upon known quantities or remember facts.

<!-- -->

- Wisdom

> *Wisdom represents a Hero's keen perception, intuition, and ability to make sound judgments. It reflects their ability to navigate the dangerous world of Rotted Capes by sensing hidden dangers, understanding the motivations of others, and making wise choices.*

- May be used to determine your Willpower Defense (see pg. XX).

- Skill checks and ability checks where ability to read people and situations are called upon.

- Skill checks to perceive details in the world around you.

<!-- -->

- Charisma

> *The Hero’s force of personality and likeability, Charisma is essential to those who rely upon their ability to influence and manipulate others. In the harsh world of the zombie apocalypse, Charisma is what binds survivors together.*

- May be used to determine your Willpower Defense (see pg. XX).

- Skill checks and ability checks where your ability to influence others is called upon.

*Character creation ride along: Ability Scores*  
Ruben decides to go with the point buy method, settling on Strength: 10, Dexterity: 12, Constitution: 14 Intelligence 16, Wisdom: 12, Charisma: 16. Then applying Origin and Archetype bonuses increasing his Constitution to 16 and his Charisma to 17.

Nani decides to go with the standard array, she ends up with Strength: 16, Constitution 15, Dexterity: 14 Intelligence 12, Wisdom: 13, Charisma: 11, Then applying Origin and Archetype bonuses increasing her Strength to 18 and Constitution to 16.

\</side bar\>

## Determining your Ability Scores 

Now that you have chosen your character Origin, Archetype, and any weaknesses, it’s time to determine your ability scores.

You have two ways to determine your ability scores.

**B-Lister Ability Score Array**

1.  Arrange the following scores 16,15,14,13,12,11 among your abilities any way you wish.

2.  Add any ability score bonuses from your Origin and Archetype.

**Customized starting ability scores.**

1.  You start with 36 points; spend these points to determine your ability scores using the table below.

2.  Add any ability score bonuses from your Origin and Archetype.

# Step 4: Choosing your Skill Sets and starting Feat 

*“What you know keeps you alive. Who you are shapes how you survive.”*

Forget ticking boxes for every individual skill, Rotted Capes doesn’t care if you’re trained in ‘Driving’ or ‘History.’ We care who you were when the world ended… and what kind of survivor you became after.

Instead of traditional skills, you create a Skill Set, narrative-driven bundles of experience that reflect your background, instincts, and training. Each one tells a story: Were you a Combat Medic, a Conspiracy Theorist, an Enclave Watchman, or a washed-up Pop Star with a sharp ear for danger?

Skill Sets are designed for cinematic play. They’re flexible. They reward creativity. They’re not about niche technical proficiencies; they’re about who your character is, what they’ve been through, and how they tackle problems in a world that doesn’t play fair.

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride-along: Step 4 Skills and Feats*

Ruben decides that his hero was a detective before Z’day who himself after has done damn well, so he chooses to go with two Skill Sets: “*Former Law Enforcement Detective”* and *“Uban Survivalist”* writing up a quick description for each and then chooses *Improved Burnout Threshold* for his bonus feat.

> ***Former Law Enforcement Detective**  
> You’ve walked the beat, worked the cases, and seen how bad the world could get before the dead started walking. You're trained to assess scenes, read people, and pursue leads with dogged determination. Great for investigation, interrogation, and keeping your cool under pressure.*
>
> ***Urban Survivalist**  
> You knew the city before it fell, and you know it even better now that it's rotting. You move through alleys like arteries, scavenge what others miss, and vanish before things go out loud. Ideal for scavenging, stealth, navigating urban decay, and staying alive off scraps.*

Nani decides that her hero has been around for a long time, and she likes the sample Skill Set, “I’ve Seen Empires Rise and Fall.” She decides to go with that one and opts to choose two feats, selecting *Learn Combat Maneuver* twice (learning Devastating Attack and Shoulder Charge)*.*

*I’ve Seen Empires Rise and Fall  
You’ve watched the world change, slowly, brutally, beautifully. Whether you’re two hundred years old or just extremely well-read and widely traveled, your perspective gives you an edge. You shine when recognizing patterns, understanding cultures, and navigating crises with the calm of someone who’s seen worse.*

Nani notes that she acquired Learn Maneuver twice and Seasoned Survivor though her skill sets, she chooses the unique device feat for her sword as her bonus feat. Looking over maneuvers she picks Devastating Attack and Team Attack.

\</side bar\>

##  Starting Skills Sets, Feats, and Languages. 

You start with one Skill Set and one feat of your choice. Additionally, you have the choice of taking a second skill set or an additional feat.

While heroes with the *Highly Trained* Origin gain an additional Skill Set or Feat of their choice.

*Starting Languages:* You also start knowing how to read and write your native language, as well as an additional number of languages equal to your Intelligence bonus.

###  Crafting a Skill Set 

A Skill Set represents your hero’s background, instincts, and learned experience, the things they fall back on when the powers burn out and the bullets run dry. They’re not individual skills or static bonuses. They’re cinematic, story-driven narrative roles that shape how your character tackles problems in the world of Rotted Capes.

When crafting a Skill Set, think in broad strokes. What kind of survivor are you? Were you a Combat Medic? A Grifter? A Street Prophet who claims they saw Z-Day coming?

**What makes a well-crafted Skill Set?**

- A clear narrative name, this can be cinematic or deadpan (e.g., “Ex-Special Forces Operative, Urban Explorer,” “Field Surgeon,” “Black Market Scavenger”, “Hair to the mask”, “Trained by the Brotherhood of Assassins”)

- A small description of what the Skill Set entails, giving a general overview of the capabilities afforded by your skill set while giving your hero a bit of flavor or style, like how your character learned these skills or how they apply them

*Quick Overview: Using Skill Sets in Play*

Whenever your hero attempts an action that would reasonably fall within one of their Skill Sets, you roll with your Rank bonus and your chosen ability scores bonus.

Later, as you gain Feats or level up, you can expand these Skill Sets with Edges, specific areas of focused expertise that double your rank bonus when relevant (see the Skills chapter for Full Edge rules).

Skill Sets aren’t about micromanaging each skill; they’re about telling the table who you are and what you’re good at.

Here are some examples of Skill Sets

> ***Masked Detective***  
> You’ve read the files, walked through the alleys, and followed the threads. You’re not just tough, you’re sharp. Ideal for investigation, intuition, and unraveling schemes before anyone else sees them.
>
> ***Street Magician***  
> You’ve got fast hands and a smooth tongue. Whether it’s palming a coin or distracting someone with a well-timed card trick, you live by sleight of hand and misdirection. Great for infiltration, charm, or escaping sticky situations.
>
> ***Ex-Military Operative***  
> You’ve served special ops, black-ops, or just a hardened grunt. You know how to clear rooms, plan ambushes, and survive when everything goes to hell. Use this set for tactics, weapon proficiency, or intimidating green survivors into shape.

For more sample skill sets, see chapter XX: Skill Sets. pg. XX

# Step 5: Starting Powers

*Powers are the extraordinary abilities that set us apart from the regular folk, before all we had to worry about was those powers in the wrong hands, and we had our hands full with them. Now we have Super Z’s to worry about. But it’s not them that I worry the most about, they are so territorial you can keep clear of them if ya need too. I worry about those who use their powers raid enclaves for their resources while put regular folk under heal in exchange for their “protection”*

During this step, you’ll define what makes your hero superhuman. Here you’ll choose your powers, set their scores, and shape them with modifications that fine-tune their risks and rewards.

## Power Scores and Modifications

Powers use scores, just like abilities. They typically start between 10 and 16, depending on how you build your hero. You can improve these scores through power modifications, which customize how your powers work, sometimes adding limitations, sometimes unlocking potent new tricks. Modifications are the trade-offs and quirks that make your hero’s powers unique.

## Determining Your Starting Powers

You have three ways to build your starting powers. Each is designed to give you the flexibility to match your concept, whether you’re channeling a classic archetype, a precise power fantasy, or something unconventional.

### Option 1: Power Sets

The easiest way to start is by choosing a Power Set. Power Sets are thematic bundles of powers that fit your chosen archetype. Power Sets offer a quick, narrative-driven approach to getting started. After you pick your Power Set, you can apply power modifications to tweak it to your liking.

### Option 2: Power Score Arrays

If you’d rather mix and match your powers, you can select a Power Score Array that matches the number of powers you want to take. Once you’ve chosen the number of powers you want, you pick your powers and assign each power a score from the array. Then, as with Power Sets, apply modifications to make each power your own.

### Option 3: Point Buy

For maximum control, you can spend a pool of points to buy power at whatever scores you choose (within limits). This option is the most flexible, letting you craft a hero with one or two standout powers or a wide range of more balanced abilities. Just remember: the more you spread yourself too thin, the less power you can shine. Modifications come last, letting you customize your choices.

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride-along: Step 5: Starting Powers*  
Ruben chooses to go with the point buy option, picking the powers of personal force field, move object, and Energy Blast, with Kinetic as his damage type. He has 32 points to buy power scores and ends up with a personal force field: 16, move object: 16, and Energy Blast (Kinetic): 17. He chooses to have all the powers linked, boosting them to 18, 18, and 19, respectively.

Nani wants to hit things. She chooses to go with the power score array option, choosing the powers of Armor, Enhanced Ability (Choosing Strength), Energy Blast (Electrical Damage), Invulnerability (Electricity Damage), and chooses a sword as her mystical item, giving it Enhanced Attack (Electrical damage). She sees the array for 5 powers, giving her scores of 16, 15, 14, 12, and 12, allowing her to arrange them as she wants.

So Nani applies her scores, ending up with Armor: 16, Enhanced Ability (Strength): 15, Energy Blast (Electrical):14, Invulnerability (electricity):12, and Enhanced Attack (Electrical):12  
  
She chooses the *Underpowered Form* flaw requiring her to call upon the power of her father and the sword he gifted her to take her true form, giving her a +2 to all her powers, she also *Links* her armor and enhanced ability powers granting them an additional +2 to those powers, finally she applies the *Removable Item* flaw to her sword raising her Enhanced Attack power by +2 as well.

Finalizing her power scores to Armor: 20, Enhanced Ability (Strength): 19, Energy Blast (Electrical):16, Invulnerability (electricity):14, and her sword now possesses Enhanced Attack (Electrical):16

\</side bar\>

**Option 1: Choose a Power Set**

1.  Choose a power set: Power sets are collections of similar powers that fall within a particular theme; if you choose a power set, you must choose a power set in accordance with your archetype. Once you choose your power set, you may rearrange the power scores as you wish among the set’s powers. While power sets limit your choices, they do have slightly higher scores than those provided by other options.

2.  Apply any power flaws/perks to your powers which may increase or decrease the final score

    1.  You may apply any number of power modifications to a power. Still, if a power’s final score, after modifications, exceeds your rank cap (23 during hero creation), it is capped at this maximum. Any points above the cap are considered untapped potential. You can utilize the power’s score up to the new rank cap as you increase in rank.

    2.  You may not use perks to reduce a power’s final score below 10.

**Option 2: B-Lister Power Score Array**

3.  Choose one of the following arrays and arrange it among your chosen powers

> Power arrays: 20,18
>
> 18,16,15
>
> 16,16,14,14
>
> 16,15,14,12,12

4.  Apply any power flaws/perks to your powers which may increase or decrease the final score

    1.  You may apply any number of power modifications to a power, but if a power’s final score, after modifications, exceeds your power score cap (23 during hero creation), it is capped at this maximum. Any points above the cap are considered untapped potential. You can utilize the power’s score up to the new rank cap as you increase in rank.

    2.  You may not use perks to reduce a power’s final score below 10.

**Option 3: Customized starting ability scores.**

1.  You start with 32 power points. Use these points to buy your starting power scores using the table below.

2.  Apply any power flaws/perks to your powers that may increase or decrease the final score.

    1.  You may apply any number of power modifications to a power, but if a power’s final score, after modifications, exceeds your power score cap (23 during hero creation), it is capped at this maximum. Any points above the cap are considered untapped potential. You can utilize the power’s score up to the new rank cap as you increase in rank.

    2.  You may not use perks to reduce a power’s final score below 10.

# Part 6: Weaknesses 

Many heroes possess unique flaws, which in many ways define them as a hero. Maybe your hero is violently allergic to rare metal, maybe you are particularly vulnerable to sonic attacks or find all their powers nullified around strong electrical fields.

You are *not* required to choose a weakness. You may choose to skip this step.

While some weaknesses are limited to a specific origin, they be applied to another origin with your Editor-in-Chief’s approval.

When you choose a weakness, you gain a number of points. You may only acquire a maximum of 20 points through weaknesses; you can always choose more weaknesses at no mechanical benefit. Spend these points on the options below in any combination.

Editor’s Note:

**The none-weakness:** Both the players and the Editor-in-Chief should work together to develop a hero’s weakness. The Editor-in-Chief should be alert for “non-weaknesses,” where players attempt to minimize the impact of a weakness while gaining maximum benefits.

For example, if you are running a campaign in sunny Miami, a hero with weakness against extreme cold weather conditions may be attempting to “game” the system.

**\<side bar\>**

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride along: Weaknesses.*  
Although they don’t have to, both players take on a weakness.

Ruben has chosen to give his hero a physical vulnerability: something about his telekinetic powers seems to be affected by gravity powers. He chooses a Stimuli: Gravity Powers and the effect of Power Negation of all his powers. Gravity Powers are rare, so they are worth 0 points, but power negation is worth 10 points and use it to gain an additional bonus feat, choosing the feat *Quick*.

Nani decides to give their hero a dependent: her little sister. She is only 8, so although she is in good health, she is not yet fully capable. Nani gains 10 points and uses it to gain +1 to her Enhanced Strength power, raising it to 20, and +1 to her constitution score, raising it to 16.

\</side bar\>

## Addiction 

*You need it. You want it. You gotta have it.*

*There is something out there you desperately crave. During the Glory Days, it was easy to get enough of it to keep you going. But now, after Z-Day, supplies are scarce, and getting your fix is becoming harder and harder. How far will you go before you crash?*

**Effect:** To build an Addiction, select a substance your hero is addicted to. You may be addicted to more than one substance. If you are, purchase the substance that gives the highest possible bonus first, then add a +1 build point for each additional addictive substance. Characters must partake of their addictive substance at least once per day. If they fail to partake, they suffer disadvantage on all skill and power checks until they partake again. While characters are assumed to start playing with a stockpile of whatever substance they’re addicted to, the Editor-in-Chief can always declare that this stockpile is depleted, ruined, or missing; at this point, you will need to seek a new supply.

**Substance:**

- **Common:** Substances could include sugar and/or surgery foods (such as candy), cigarettes, or coffee. ***  
  You gain 5 points.***

- **Uncommon:** Substances could include certain mild drugs (such as marijuana or commercial painkillers), vaping (electronic cigarettes), alcohol, or inhaling certain chemical fumes. ***You gain 10 points.***

- **Rare:** Substances could include hard drugs (cocaine, meth, PCP, and the like), commercially available amphetamines, or medical painkiller (such as Oxycodone and the like). ***You gain 15 points.***

## Dark Secret

*There is something about you you’d prefer to keep hidden.*

**Effect:** There is something in your past that you’d like to keep hidden. Having the secret exposed could damage your standing and/or reputation among their teammates or bystanders, resulting in you longer being taken seriously, having privileges or supplies taken away, putting you under suspicion of any recent crimes, or in a worst-case scenario, they could have you expelled from their current enclave.

- Your secret is something trivial and more potentially embarrassing than damaging. For example, maybe you were a boyband pop star, participated in a low-brow reality show, was a cringeworthy YouTuber, or had a popular We Fan page. ***You gain 5 points.***

- Maybe you made a few deals with supervillains, or you are a former criminal (whose crimes go beyond petty theft and the like). Or, they may claim experience you don’t have (such as claiming to be a doctor, having military experience, or being a police officer). ***You gain 10 points.***

- You may have resorted to cannibalism to survive the initial aftermath of Z-Day, maybe you’re a registered sex offender, or you may have committed one or more murders (either before or after Z-Day). Or, they may claim to be someone they’re not — a former US Senator, a high-ranking member of the Federal government, or they’ve taken the identity of a different B-Lister (who may or may not still be alive). ***You gain 15 points.***

## Dependence 

*Your metabolism or physiology is such that you require frequent exposure to a particular condition (such as sunlight or immersion in water), or you must partake of a specific substance (such as an experimental medicine), or your equipment might require frequent repair or refueling.*

**Effect:** To build a Dependency, apply each step and add up the points acquired. You shouldn’t have more than one Dependency. You must satisfy their dependence at least once per day; if you fail to do so, they’ll suffer a negative effect. In addition, the time it takes to satisfy the dependence can be a factor. Simply popping a pill offers fewer points than needing to spend hours soaking in a tub of water.

**Substance:**

- **Common:** Substances could include immersion in water, exposure to sunlight, or a commonly available alcohol-based fuel. ***You gain 0 points.***

- **Uncommon:** Substances could include needing to ‘bathe’ in a large bonfire, extensive repairs requiring easily scavenged parts, a custom fuel that takes time to distill, or an easily synthesized drug. ***You gain 5 points.***

- **Rare:** Substances could include extensive repairs requiring hard-to-find parts, exposure to a specific form of radiation, or a drug custom-made to keep you alive. ***You gain 10 points.***

**Negative Effects:**

- **Power Negation:** All your powers stop working until you can partake in your dependency. ***You gain 5 points.***

- **Physical Weakness:** You suffer a disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, Constitution checks and skill checks until you can partake in your dependency. ***You gain 5 points.***

- **Incapacitating Weakness:** If you fail to meet your Dependency requirement, your maximum Stamina is reduced by 2d12 every hour until you reach 0 Stamina and fall unconscious or until you partake in your dependency. If you reach 0 stamina, you remain unconscious until you partake in your dependency. You recover your lost Stamina after completing a Hiatus. ***You gain 10 points.***

- **Fatal Weakness:** If you fail to meet your Dependence requirement, you lose 1 wound every hour until you reach 0 wounds or until you partake of your dependency. If you reach 0 wounds you die unless you can partake of your dependency within 1 minute after reaching 0 wounds. You recover wounds lost from suffering this weakness after completing a Hiatus. ***You gain 15 points.***

## Dependent

There is someone you care about who depends on you for survival.

**Effect:** Simply put, there is someone close to you who depends on you for survival. This goes above and beyond a Supporting Cast member into something far more personal. Your dependent can be a younger sibling, a daughter or son, an elderly relative, and so on.

- Your Dependent can be a person of *average* health and ability, they are a survivor of the apocalypse and know how to get by. ***You gain 5 points.***

- Your Dependent is weaker than the *common* survivor. While their mind may still be sharp, their body is aged, injured, or ravaged by illness. Although they are able to still walk, they do so slowly and have difficulty with stairs and the like. ***You gain 10 points.***

- Your Dependent is of *frail* health. They may be blind, deaf, partially paralyzed, and so on. They depend on you for most of their needs, and would probably quickly succumb to the dangerous of the post-apocalyptic world if left alone. ***You gain 15 points.***

### Sample Dependents

There are sample dependents in chapter XXX of this book, alternately you may choose to build a dependent using the following options.

|             | **Abilities (Points - Array)** | **Skills Points** |
|-------------|:-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Average** | \(25\) 12, 11, 10, 10, 10, 9   | 15                |
| **Weak**    | \(20\) 12, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8      | 10                |
| **Frail**   | \(15\) 12, 10, 9, 8, 8, 8      | 5                 |

**Weak Dependents** possess the Mentally Frail or Physically Frail weakness (see below).

**Frail Dependents** possess the Mentally Frail or Physically Frail weakness as well as either a Severe Mental Flaw or Severe Physical Flaw (see below).

### Dependent Archetypes:

The following examples should give you an idea of the kind of Dependents your Hero can have.

- **The Younger Sibling:** The younger sibling usually idolizes you and wants to be just like you when they grow up. They may wear a variant of your costume, practice their combat skills, and cobble together sufficient gear in an effort to emulate your super powers. They may try to be your sidekick, joining you on excursions, or they may try to go out on their own. In any event, odds are that sooner or later they will get in over their head, forcing you to try and rescue them.

- **The Child:** The child is similar to the sibling; in that they usually look up to you and may also want to be ‘just like you’ when they get older. However, the child is often far younger than the sibling, and is less capable of taking care of themselves. In addition, you need to see to the child’s instruction and training, especially in the use of weapons and survival skills. Your enemies may see your child as a vulnerability they can exploit, someone they can kidnap and use to force you to do their bidding.

- **The Spouse/Lover:** Unlike many who survived the onset of Z-Day, you were able to protect your spouse (or lover) from the zombie hordes. This may result in you being overly protective of them, and working overtime to ensure their safety. They may worry about you as well, and may try to talk you into engaging in less risky behavior and try to encourage you to remain within the relative safety of the enclave. If you’re away too often, your spouse or lover may find solace in the company of another, a situation which will probably not end well for anyone.

- **The Elderly Relative:** Be it your father, grandmother, or aged aunt, you seek to protect and keep safe one of the last remaining members of your immediate family. The Elderly Relative is often either frail or handicapped and may be bed-ridden or require special medical needs. As much as you hate to admit it, they are often a drain on the enclave’s resources without giving much back in return. And if you ever need to abandon the enclave quickly, their physical health may not take the strain.

- **The Mentor/Father Figure:** Unlike the younger sibling who looks up to you, this is someone you look up to. This person might be a former superhero who taught you the ropes, but whose health has declined with old age. Or a replacement for the mother or father you never knew, who brought you up when no one else cared. Or your boss from before Z-Day, who helped you succeed. In any event, this person’s wisdom and wise council is such that you wish to preserve it despite all the post-apocalyptic world throws at you.

- **The Beloved Pet:** When you’ve lost everything, then you might seek solace in an animal companion. Your dog (or cat, or monkey, or…) may be the last thing left from your previous life, or it might be an animal you adopted while wandering the apocalyptic wasteland. In any event, your pet means as much to you as a child or sibling might mean to another Hero. Better keep a close eye on it, lest some other survivor gets hungry and decides to eat it.

**What happens if the Dependent dies?  **
Considering the nature of the world post Z-Day, your Hero will need to consider the possibility of their Dependent’s death. What then? First, unlike the Glory Days, you have almost no chance of getting a new Dependent. Or, one with as deep an emotional bond as the one you lost. To represent the physiological trauma of losing your Dependent in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested world your Hero will need to replace their Dependent Disadvantage with another weakness fitting the situation.

- **Enemy:** Mad with grief and anger, you must now seek out whoever (or whatever) killed your Dependent to the exclusion of all else. This enemy is well aware of your disposition toward them and returns your intent in kind.

- **Mental Disorder: Death wish:** You have nothing left to live for. You no longer care about your own safety or survival, and will take on more and more risky missions and actions, all in an effort to join your Dependent in death. You may not even care about others anymore, as it is obvious that no matter what you do, everyone around you is going to die.

- **Dark Secret:** Maybe it was your direct actions that led to your dependent’s death. The knowledge of which would shake your enclave to its core.

## Enemy

*Someone out there doesn’t like you.*

*Before Z-Day almost every superhero had a rogues’ gallery of foes. After Z-Day most of these rogues either died, were Z’d, or joined the assorted B-Listers in defending the rest of humanity. For you, their place has been taken by someone new. This someone may be an individual (such as a supervillain with an extreme grudge) or a group (such as a horde of religious fanatics who wish to burn you and your enclave for spurning them). In any event, you need to be careful anytime you venture outside the enclave, as you never know where your enemy may be waiting.*

**Effect:** Your enemy always seems to find a way to complicate your life and the lives of those around you. The Editor-in-Chief may have your enemy show up at any time. Even if you take countermeasures to create some distance between you and your enemy, it is only a matter of time before they show up again. ***You gain 5 points, with Tyrant being worth 10.***

\<side bar\>**  **
Editor’s Note:  
**There are always bigger fish:** If the heroes somehow defeat the hero’s Enemy, it’s not the end of the story, if anything the defeat of an enemy should open the door to a new threat.

\</side bar\>

### Sample Enemies

The following examples should give you an idea of the kind of Enemies your Hero can have. Make sure to discuss your idea with the Editor-in-Chief, first to see if your idea fits the campaign, and second to see what changes the Editor-in- Chief wants to make to your Enemy (not all of which you may know about!).

**Biker Gang:** Post Z-Day most biker gangs stay on the move, looting first one area then another. In this case, you have something the bikers want. Perhaps there’s a former motorcycle dealership in your enclave, full of parts they need. Or you have a working fuel refinery and all the gas the bikers will ever need. Or you have the only decent food stores for miles around. In any case, the bikers want into your enclave and will do anything to gain entry. While you might be safe behind your walls, sooner or later you’ll need to go out into the ruins to scavenge for supplies and the bikers will be waiting. Worst yet, there may come a time when the bikers become desperate enough to launch an all-out assault on your enclave. Will you and your fellow B-Listers be able to stop them?

**Cannibals:** Similar to the biker gang (and as an added bonus you can make them a cannibal biker gang), this is a group of people that eats other people. The exact reasons vary: they may be religious fanatics (see Cultists below) seeking to emulate zombies by devouring the living; they may use it as an initiation ritual, forcing others to partake of human flesh in order to ‘mark’ them; or, they may simply feel that it’s easier to catch and devour others than bother trying to raise chickens and pigs. In any case, they wish to devour you and your companions. Probably because they have a misguided idea that eating the body of a superhuman will give them superhuman powers, try not to get caught.

**Cultists:** Cultists are religious fanatics whose faith is dark and twisted. They seek to impose their will, and their religious ways, on everyone around them. Infidels, which in their case is anyone who doesn’t believe *exactly* as they do, are to be purged, often with fire. Cultists may despise zombies, or they may worship them (leading to cannibal cultists), but in any event, they have no use for your enclave (aside from the resources it offers). If you do not convert to their ways by choice, then they will convert you by force. Similar in some respects to a biker gang, the cultists are less like to lay in wait and will probably attack openly. Unfortunately, their fanaticism makes them highly unlikely to break and run.

**Tyrant:** This is an enclave, or series of enclaves, dedicated to one thing and one thing only, their leader. Everything anyone does, they do for the ‘state’, and no one is allowed to dissent. Free and independent enclaves, such as yours, are an anathema to them and must be brought to heel. The tyrant and their followers are probably the most dangerous form of Enemy a Hero can have as they are often well-organized, well-equipped, and well-trained. They are also implacable. Since the leader can’t appear weak, the tyrant’s followers will almost never give up the attack and will come at you and your enclave again and again. They may also use sophisticated tactics, weaponry, and individuals, including B-Listers of their own. Fortunately for you, these fanatics are usually led by a single strong man, and if you can take him out, much of the power goes with him. As the tyrant tends to be paranoid and power-hungry, they usually haven’t made provisions for when they’re no longer around. Remove the tyrant, and infighting among the lieutenants usually takes care of the rest.

## Mental Condition 

Your mind isn’t as resilient as others’, whether due to phobias, trauma, neurological divergence, or simple lack of mental acuity.

**Effect:** To build a Mental Condition, pick an option at each step and add up the total points acquired. You may choose multiple negative effects to the same stimulus, gaining the highest possible bonus: **+5 points** for each additional negative effect.

***Step 1: Choose the Type***

- **Cognitive Limitation**: ADHD, Dyslexia, or learning delays. You may struggle to focus or process complex tasks.

- **Emotional Instability:** mood swings, panic attacks, explosive anger, or inappropriate emotional reactions.

- **Disorder or Trauma:** PTSD, dissociative identity, obsessive compulsions, hallucinations.

- **Low Mental Resilience:** You’re unusually vulnerable to fear, horror, and psychotic breaks.

***Step 2: Choose severity***

- ***Slight:*** Minor inconvenience or phobia. Disadvantage on 1 type of check under stress. ***You gain 5 points.***

- ***Challenging:*** Disadvantage on all checks involving one mental stat (INT, WIS, or CHA) **or** Psychosis saves. ***You gain 10 points.***

- ***Sever:*** Disadvantage on all saves vs. Psychosis and on all checks involving 2 mental stats. ***You gain 15 points.***

***Step 3: Triggering Complications***

> *Once per session, the Editor-in-Chief may trigger a severe manifestation (e.g., panic attack, hallucination, breakdown). This forces you to act irrationally or skip your next turn. Doing so earns a Plot Point (per the standard Flaw rules).*

## Physical Condition 

*Whether due to age, injury, illness, or simple genetics, your body isn’t built for the rigors of heroism. You might have a limp, brittle bones, chronic fatigue, or be missing key body parts, but you're still standing. Mostly.*

**Effect:** To build a Physical Condition, pick an option at each step and add up the total points acquired. You may choose multiple negative effects to the same stimulus, gaining the highest possible bonus: **+5 points** for each additional negative effect.

***Step 1: Choose the Cause***

You may define your Physical Condition as:

- Injury (missing limb, chronic pain, neurological impairment)

- Frail Physiology (extremely young, old, or otherwise delicate)

- Degenerative Illness (muscular dystrophy, respiratory disorder)

- Impairment (blindness, deafness, mobility issues)

- Low Physical Aptitude (naturally weak, slow, or uncoordinated)

***Step 2: Choose severity***

- ***Slight:*** Disadvantage on physical actions involving one body part or sense (e.g., one arm, one eye). ***You gain 5 points.***

- ***Challenging:*** Disadvantage on all checks involving one physical ability score (STR, DEX, or CON). ***You gain 10 points.***

- ***Sever:*** Disadvantage on all STR, DEX, and CON rolls and reduce max Stamina by 10. ***You gain 15 points.***

***Optional: Dependents’ Flaws***

*If this condition applies to a Dependent instead of the hero, it also reduces their skill points and ability scores (see Dependent Creation).*

## Physical Vulnerabilities

*You possess a physical vulnerability against a particular material (such as lead) or condition (such as daylight or being exposed to gamma radiation).*

*Both heroes and villains will do everything in their power to keep any vulnerability secret even from their closest friends and companions.*

**Restriction:** cannot be taken by the highly trained or tech heroes.

**Effect:** To build a Unique Vulnerability simply apply each step and add up total points acquired. You may choose multiple negative effects to the same stimuli, gaining the highest possible bonus; **+5 points** for each additional negative effect.

**Part 1: Choose a Stimuli:**

> *Material Weakness:* If a particular type of material is chosen (such as lead), Any time you start your turn within 2 areas of that substance you suffer from this weaknesses effect. At the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, a huge amount of the material in question may increase this weaknesses’ effective range.
>
> *Conditional Weakness:* Any time you are exposed to a particular environmental condition; they suffer from their vulnerabilities effects until they can get away from or are free of that condition.
>
> *Energy Weakness:* Choose a particular energy type; for example, Sonic, Cold, Heat, Gamma Radiation, and so on. You suffer effects of this weakness if you are exposed to this energy type consciously for more than 1 turn or if you are the target of a power or attack which utilizes this energy type.

**Part 2: Choose a Stimuli’s Rarity:**

> *Common items:* Stimuli may include plastic, glass, steel, daylight, storms, or being tied up with rope or chains. ***You gain 10 points.***
>
> *Uncommon items:* Stimuli may include lead, mercury, gold, being exposed to extreme temperatures, open fire, being attacked by magic, or being knee deep in water. ***You gain 5 points.***
>
> *Rare items:* Stimuli may include items such as a rare type of meteorite from a distant planet or being exposed to the radiation of a distant sun. ***You gain 0 points.***

**Part 3: Choose Negative Effect:**

> *Power Negation:* All of your inborn powers simply stop working until the end of your next turn if you start your turn within range of your chosen martial or under your chosen environmental condition. If you are the target of an attack which uses an energy type, you have a weakness toward your inborn powers cease to function until the end of your next turn. ***You gain 5 points.***
>
> *Physical Weakness:* Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores are reduced to 8 any time you start your turn within range of or being exposed to your chosen stimuli, or if you are the target of an attack or power which utilizes an energy type you are weak against. Your ability scores continue to remain diminished as long as you remain exposed to the stimuli. You regain your ability scores at the end of your next turn after no longer being exposed to your chosen stimuli. ***You gain** **5 points.***
>
> *Physical Vulnerability:* You possess physical vulnerability against an energy type or weapons made of a material you are weak against. These attacks bypass any damage reduction you might possess and deal double damage. ***You gain** **10 points.***
>
> *Deadly weakness:* You possess vulnerability against damage dealt by energy types or weapons made of a material you are weak against. These attacks bypass any damage reduction you might possess. If you start your turn within range of a material or under a condition you are weak against, you instead suffer 4d6 damage, which bypasses any damage reduction you might possess. The Extra damage dealt by this disadvantage is applied when determining the possibility of massive damage. ***You gain 10 points.***
>
> *Lethal weakness:* Any time you start your turn within range or of, or being exposed to, your weakness or if you are the target of an attack or power which utilizes an energy type you are weak against you gain a level of exhaustion*.* Once you leave the range of the substance you lose a level of exhaustion granted by this weakness at the rate of 1 level per minute. ***You gain 15 points.***

## Ravenous Metabolism 

*Your body requires much more food than a regular person.*

**Restriction:** Super-Human, Cosmic, or Supernatural, or Alien or Andromorph Archetype

**Effect:** During the Glory Days food was never really a problem for you; with drive through, vending machines, and the local supermarket, you were never more than an arm’s reach away from a power bar. But things have changed. You require double the food of a regular person, and must eat something every 6 hours in between regular meals, be it beef jerky, Twinkies, an apple, or what have you. Although you can attempt to keep yourself well-supplied with food stores, there will come times when the Editor-in-Chief simply informs you food supplies are running low, which may force you to undertake a scavenger run, seek out fruit trees, and so on. If you do not eat on regular bases (every 6 hours) your Burnout Threshold decreases by 5 for every meal you skip, to a minimum of 5. ***You gain 5 points.***

## Strange Appearance

*You possess a strange or disturbing appearance which may entice or terrify others.*

**Effect:** To build a Strange Appearance, choose its ease of concealment and your appearance’s effect on others then add up the points acquired. Bystanders or other heroes who do not know you on a personal basis may be quick to judge, flee from you, or in the case of someone with a threatening appearance, may attack you. Additionally, you suffer a penalty to all Influence skill rolls equal to the amount of points acquired through this disadvantage.

*Ease of Concealment:* If your strange appearance is easily concealed, ***you gain 0 points*.** If your strange appearance is impossible to hide (such as fur or a demonic appearance), ***you gain 5 points.***

*Effect upon others:* If you possess a slightly disturbing or strangely attractive trait (such as red eyes or shining silver hair) ***you gain 0 points***. If your appearance is disturbing or mildly threatening (small horns or giant bat wings) ***you gain 5 points*.** If your appearance is outright threatening (you possess the aforementioned demonic appearance), ***you gain 10 points.***

## Taboo

*You are restricted from actions a normal person can perform.*

**Effect:** The nature of your existence means there are certain things you simply cannot do. Perhaps your mystical powers require you to refrain from eating meat or bathing. Perhaps your android programming includes a failsafe against certain behavior. Perhaps your supernatural nature prevents you from entering a building without being invited. To build a Taboo apply each step and add up the points acquired. The Hero may choose multiple Taboos, gaining the highest possible bonus, **+5 points** for each additional restriction.

**Part 1: Restriction**

- *Easy:* These restrictions either have few negative effects when followed or are rarely encountered. Examples include not interacting with a particular person, not bathing except in a natural lake or river, or not crossing a line of salt. ***You gain 0 points.***

- *Moderate:* These restrictions make life difficult or are frequently encountered. Restrictions could include not touching bare human skin, not remaining in the presence of a symbol of faith, or not attacking without offering a chance to surrender. ***You gain 5 points.***

- *Difficult:* These restrictions negatively impact your life daily. Restrictions could include not eating food that you have not killed and prepared yourself, not touching metal, or not harming a living being. ***You gain 10 points.***

**Part 2: Negative Effects**

- Power Negation: All of the affected powers simply stop working when the Taboo is broken, until you Atone. ***You gain 5 points per power affected.***

- Physical Weakness: All of your ability scores are reduced by 2 until you Atone. ***You gain 5 points.***

- Impossibility: It is simply impossible for you to break this Taboo. You are physically incapable of doing so. If you are somehow forced to do so, you must dedicate you efforts into no longer breaking the Taboo in the most efficient manner possible. Since you cannot willingly break this Taboo, there is no atonement option. ***You gain 10 points.***

- Incapacitating Weakness: After initial violation of the Taboo you lose 1d8 stamina that bypasses all Damage resistance at the end of every turn until they atone or fall unconscious. They remain so until they Atone, which might be difficult if they are unconscious. ***You gain 10 points.***

- Fatal Weakness: After breaking the Taboo, you begin to lose 1 wound every minute you reach 0 wounds, at which point you die. This process ends if you atone, but unless the Atonement is simple it is very unlikely to happen before death. ***You gain 15 points.***

**Part 3: Atonement**

- Simple Atonement: Atonement for breaking this Taboo is simple to perform and requires no special materials. It might involve spending an hour in prayer, or running a system reset. Even a simple atonement should take at least a scene to perform. ***You gain 0 points.***

- Difficult Atonement: Atonement for breaking this Taboo is difficult to perform, requiring at least a day, and perhaps special materials not easily available after Z-Day. It might involve burning incense or finding electronic equipment to replace fused wiring. ***You gain 5 points.***

- Atonement Quest: Atonement for breaking this Taboo involves a heroic quest that should be the subject of its own Issue, or perhaps even Mini-Series. It might involve tracking down an android’s original programmer, a ghost returning to the distant place of their death to reconnect with their old life or passing a series of spiritual trials to reconnect with mystic power. ***You gain 10 points.***

# Step 7 Starting Gear 

You start with a go-bag and a few other items, for a list of gear on see pg XX.

All Heroes begin play with the following: see gear page XX

- A single firearm or an archaic ranged weapon.

- A single melee weapon.

- A single go-bag.

- Note that some feats will give you Acquisition Points, which you may spend on additional gear.

*Character creation ride-along: Step 8 Defenses and Attributes*  
Now our players are in the home stretch and need to do the final mechanical touches to their heroes.

Ruban and Nani have a rank bonus of +1.

Now, to Defenses, Ruban looks at his finalized ability scores and chooses his intelligence for his Avoidance, Constitution for his Fortitude defense, and his Charisma for his Willpower defense, giving him starting defenses of Avoidance: 14, Fortitude: 13, and Willpower: 15. He notes his Quick feat gives him a +1 bonus to his Avoidance setting it at 15.

Nani does the same, choosing her Dexterity for her Avoidance, Strength for her Fortitude, and Wisdom for her Willpower defense, giving her final defenses of Avoidance: 12, Fortitude: 15, and Willpower: 13. Her final Fortitude is 17 thanks to her toughness feat.

Stamina, being the sub of all of one’s defenses, is 43 for Ruban and 51 (41 +10 from Toughness feat) for Nani. And they both start with 3 wounds.

Pace and Initiative both rely on dexterity, giving Ruban a pace of 2 (thanks to the *Quick* feat) and a +0 bonus to initiative, and Nani a pace of 2 and a +2 bonus to initiative.

Burnout Threshold: The base burnout threshold is 10. Ruban learned the feat *Increase Burnout Threshold,* so his burnout threshold is 15

\</side bar\>

### Rank Bonus

This bonus is equal to your hero’s rank, so you start with a Rank bonus of +1

### Grit 

As first mentioned on page XX, your Grit bonus is added to saving throws. Your Grit is equal to your Rank, which can be further adjusted by your Origin or feats you may have purchased during hero creation.

### Defenses 

Defenses reflect your ability to avoid or resist attacks of all kinds, with each defense dependent upon one of two ability scores. You possess three defenses.

**Avoidance**

> Avoidance is your ability to read incoming attacks and dodge them. It combines elements of your athleticism and logic. Whenever an attack seeks to strike you physically, the attack targets your Avoidance Defense. Armor and benefits from shields adversely modify avoidance.

Avoidance = 10 + Dexterity Modifier or your Intelligence Modifier + Rank (+1)

**Fortitude**

> Fortitude is the Hero’s ability to withstand severe trauma, poisons, and diseases. It combines elements of your health and conditioning. Whenever an attack inflicts trauma on your health and physical well-being, the attack targets your Fortitude Defense.

Fortitude = 10 + Strength Modifier or your Constitution Modifier+ Rank (+1)

**Willpower**

> Willpower is your ability to overcome hardship, resist attacks on the mind, and remain focused in the face of distraction. It combines elements of your force of personality and insight. Whenever an attack seeks to deceive or dominate you, the attack targets the Hero’s Willpower Defense

Willpower = 10 + Charisma Modifier or your Wisdom Modifier+ Rank (+1)

\<Side Bar\>  
**Difference between defenses and saving throws:**

Defenses are your first line of defense against many effects, while saving throws are commonly used to represent shaking off or otherwise ending an ongoing effect.

\</Side Bar\>

### Health 

Your health, stamina, and wounds reflect your ability to endure physical harm and suffering.

**Stamina**

> Stamina represents you’re staying power during combat; it is not just your physical toughness, but it's also your endurance under duress.
>
> When determining your stamina, you only apply your base defenses with no conditional modifiers. (such as those provided by powers or feats). When your Defenses advance (see Advancement, page xx), your Stamina increases accordingly.

Stamina = Avoidance Defense + Fortitude Defense + Willpower Defense

**Wounds**

Wounds represent your Hero’s ability to absorb raw, physical trauma.

Wounds = heroes possess 3 wounds or half your constitution modifier whichever is greater.

### Pace 

Pace represents how fast you can run. You can move a maximum number of areas in a round equal to their Dexterity Modifier (minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5). This may be further increased through Powers or feats.

### Initiative 

You have an Initiative Bonus, which is equal to your Dexterity Modifier, which may be increased through Powers or feats.

Initiative = Dexterity Modifier

### Burnout Threshold \`

Some powers cause stress and fatigue on a Hero, occasionally reaching a point where the Hero’s powers stop working for a time. This may leave them vulnerable to zombie infection or being served as dinner.

Your Burnout Threshold starts at 10 + Feats chosen during character creation.

# The Finishing Touch 

## Personality Flaws 

*I remember The Hood telling me once that there’s always something that separates us from the bystanders, a darkness that keeps us from ever being like them. She called it “compensation” for our empowerment. Sometimes it’s attached to our powers, but more often it’s attached to our hearts. It’s a weakness that others like us can exploit.*

*I never really understood what she meant until Z-Day hit. Fighting to survive certainly turned up the pressure and for every ‘superhero’ I saw rise from the ashes, I saw that darkness as well. Sometimes it brought out the best in heroes; I’ve seen superheroes that could’ve easily escaped stand in the way of a zombie horde just to buy some time for fleeing bystanders. Sometimes it brings out the worst; I’ve seen superheroes rationalize throwing one or two weaker bystanders into the clutches of the zombies just to buy time to escape.*

*This darkness, this flaw, is different for each of us, but it’s undeniably a part of all of us. I can’t explain why, but then again I can’t explain shooting jets of flame from fingertips or super strength either. Sometimes, it just is.*

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride along: The Finishing Touches*  
First off both players pick their personality flaws.

Ruben picks Darwinist and Young Gun, with his tagline being “ha, you thought you had me.”

Nani is picked as Impatient and Overconfident, with her tagline being “Taste the lighting.”

\</side bar\>

### Personality Flaws in Play 

Personality flaws are one of the mechanisms that allow you to acquire plot points. at any time you, the editor-in-chief, or a fellow player can activate one of your personality flaws, if you accept the consequences with grace you gain a plot point, for more information on plot points see page XX

### Choosing a personality flaw 

Every player must choose at least one personality flaw. These flaws are the iconic double-edged sword; they can benefit your hero just as much as they can hinder. This is in addition to any flaws you may have gained though your Origin.

### Always a Sidekick 

*Look, whatever you guys want to do is fine by me. I wish Shooting Star was still here; he always pointed me in the right direction.*

You were a sidekick in the Glory Days and you still haven’t come to grips with the fact that you’re a top dog. You always look to others to fill the “hero” role, and you’re happy to work alongside them – or maybe just a step or two behind them.

### Berserker

*You crave battle and the madness it brings.*

Once you start fighting you don’t stop. Tactical plans, your orders, the objective, it all goes out the window once combat commences. Unlike Bloodthirsty, you don’t look for excuses to start fights, but once they start you keep going until no one is left standing… and that might mean friends as well as foes.

### Bloodthirsty 

*Cool it, man! He stole the can of tuna because he was hungry; you don’t have to beat him to a bloody pulp over it.*

You have a brutal temper that borders on sadism. You enjoy beating enemies to a bloody pulp and often look for the flimsiest excuse to consider someone an enemy.

### Chilling Presence

*Hey, don’t creep up on me like that! You know, I always thought it was just the costume, but you’ve got that moody,*

*scary thing going on even when you aren’t wearing one.*

Whether it’s the way you look, the way you sound when you talk, the way you carry yourself, or a bit of all three, you unnerve people. They don’t want to be close to you and, at times, wouldn’t mind if the zombies got you.

### Clumsy

*I know that you’re twice the width of the average Joe, but that still doesn’t excuse you from knocking things down in front of me when we’re trying to keep one step ahead of the zombies!*

You are clumsy by nature and tend to bump or fumble things at the wrong time. You also tend to drop or break things (especially if they’re fragile), and can easily find the one chunk of loose pavement to trip over, no matter how carefully you step.

### Combat Paralysis

*You tend to freeze up in stressful situations.*

When the going gets tough, you tend to not go anywhere. In times of stress (such as combat and the like), you ‘lock up,’ neither moving nor reacting for a few actions. You better hope you have friends, or you’re not going to live much longer.

### Craven 

*Forget B-Lister, you act more like a Super-Villain’s cowardly minion – or comic relief. You jump at shadows, shriek at the slightest threat of violence, and are quite afraid of… well, absolutely everything.*

During the Glory Days you were a Hero’s expert or Villain’s minion; you were never called upon to fight and you actually can’t stand violence. You firmly believe that discretion is the better part of valor and avoid conflict whenever possible.

### Darwinist 

*Sometimes you need to sacrifice one to save many.*

You won’t go out of your way to save a Bystander when the odds don’t favor it and you aren’t adverse to allowing slow or wounded Bystanders “take one for the team” and save the rest. While you may be able to convince Bystanders and other Heroes of the necessity of your actions, they often find it difficult to live with once you’re past the immediate danger.

### Greedy 

*You know that little girl needs your antibiotics, but you may need them some day! You found them, and they are yours, damn it!*

You are very possessive of items you salvage; you have a stock pile of stuff and will go out of your way to get more, risking life and limb in the process. You are also fully capable of hiding things you find from your fellow survivors.

### Gremlins

*You and technology have never been the best of friends.*

To say you have trouble using any electronic devices made after 1975 is an understatement. Whenever you’re around, computers tend to crash, cellphones build static and drop calls, sensitive scanners go haywire, newer cars stall out at the worst moments (or simply refuse to start in the first place), and so on.

### Haunted by Nightmares 

*You see the zombies in your sleep.*

You have trouble sleeping through the night without zombies infecting your dreams. At times it’s so bad that they appear in your daydreams as well.

### The Hero’s Code 

*Look, I get it. You want to fight for freedom, justice, and mom’s apple pie. But take a look around; it’s all gone, flushed down a zombie toilet. Why can’t you see that?*

Whether you actually believe in it or are just using it to hold on to your sanity, you continue to follow the unwritten code of superheroes to an extreme. You do not lie, cheat, or steal, even to survive. You treat super zombies as honorably would any other supervillain or henchman.

### Hero Worship 

*If Lady Liberty were here, she’d try to save those Bystanders. If I want to prove myself worthy of carrying on her mantle, I’ll need to try to save them as well.*

You idolize a particular hero or villain. You try to live by their code and remind others about their deeds. You may even model your own super identity on that hero or villain. Note that the subject of your worship need not be dead or Z’d and your subject may not be too happy to have you using her handle.

### Impatient 

*You have no capacity for repetitive tasks or waiting around and have a short attention span.*

You can’t stand sitting around and making plans; the zombies are everywhere and they’re closing in all the time! You want to act, now! Unfortunately, your impatience often leads you into danger with no preparation.

### Lone Wolf 

*Look, we voted and I’m the leader, remember? I want us to survive just as much as you do. Why do you keep second-guessing me and undermining my authority?*

While you understand the concept of safety in numbers, you just don’t work well with a group. Someone is always holding you back or supporting a clearly inferior course of action. You’d just rather be on your own, taking support only when you need it.

### Lying Eyes 

*Your tongue may be clever, but your eyes betray you.*

No one trusts you. Maybe it’s the way you carry yourself, maybe it’s because you make unconvincing arguments, or maybe it’s because you really don’t care. In any case, you have a difficult time convincing people of what you say.

### Megalomania 

*I’ve been telling you for years that only through an iron fist does civilization stand a chance! Look at the world now! Once I establish order we’ll wipe away the zombies once and for all!*

You were a power-mad super villain (albeit a low-powered one) during the Glory Days and Z-Day changed nothing. While you protect Bystanders and work with Heroes, you do so out of a desire to establish a new world order, with you at the top.

### Nihilistic 

*Even if we do destroy all the zombies, then what? Look around you, guys, this world is over. We’ve got nothing to look forward to but ruins and memories.*

You’ve given up hope. You survive because you must, if only to help others, but you just don’t see a glimmer of a bright future anywhere on the horizon. When things seem hopeless you’re strangely content, and it’s difficult to get you to fight against the odds.

### Oblivious 

*Hey guys, why are you all sneaking up the stairs with your guns drawn?*

You are oblivious most of the time; maybe you suffer from extreme ADHD or have simply drawn into yourself. Regardless of the cause, there are times you ignore or fail to notice what is right in front of you.

### Overconfident

*There’s nothing you can’t overcome.*

While others believe that discretion is the better part of valor, you rush in where angels fear to tread. You have complete confidence in your abilities as well as those of your companions, which sometimes leads to taking on more than you can chew.

### Over Protective 

*What do you mean, “If we send out a group maybe some of them will come back?” We can’t treat Bystanders like cattle! I’ve been protecting this enclave since Z-Day. They’re my children!*

You are extremely over-protective of the Bystanders in your enclave and treat each of them as you would your children (and you dote on your children). This makes the hard choices even more difficult for you, and you take the loss of any Bystander extremely hard.

### Patriot 

*Sure things look tough, but we’re Americans! Our nation was born in troubled times and we’ve weathered worse! We’ll get through this so long as we never forget our ideals!*

You strongly believe in something, usually the nation of your birth, and you optimistically hold on to its ideals, laws, and principles. Your patriotism is often at odds with reality, and many fellow Heroes and Bystanders aren’t appreciative of your love for the Golden Age.

### Poor Substitute 

*What do you mean, ‘I’m too young to be the Night Ranger’? I kept the city safe from Mega Master countless times! Of course I don’t have all the trick arrows anymore; I lost them years ago!*

You have not only taken on the mantle of an old superhero, you’re starting to believe that you are that superhero. Unfortunately, this goes far beyond roleplaying; at times you believe that you have access to powers that you simply don’t have, which can be dangerous when the zombie horde is surrounding you.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 

*You have seen the dark face of the apocalypse; it’s changed you, and you’re on the edge of losing it, all the time.*

Not only brought on through combat build, PTSD can be brought on by any violent traumatic build, like a zombie apocalypse. You are always on edge; you jump at loud noises and fly off the handle sometimes despite yourself. It’s hard for you to sleep, but when you do, you sleep with a knife at your side and a gun under your pillow.

### Revolutionary 

*You disagree with how your enclave is governed and you make no attempt to hide your disapproval.*

You are constantly at odds with the leadership of your enclave and actively support replacing it with another type of government. Unfortunately, you usually hold the minority opinion and most Bystanders worry that your position may one day threaten the enclave.

### Ruthless 

*You are a reformed Super-Villain or amoral hero and you try to do the right thing, but you still lack compassion for others.*

You have no appreciation for the feelings of others and fake compassion as best you can. You know that what you’re doing now is right, but you might as well be a robot as far as your feelings are concerned. You often look to other heroes to see how you should be feeling.

### Survivor’s Guilt 

*Many Bystanders in your enclave have fearfully left a friend or loved one to the clutches of zombies but they never expected it from a hero. You let someone die in a moment of weakness and no matter how much you try to make up for it, Bystanders never let you forget it.*

You just can’t put your moment of weakness behind you. Not only is it brought up every time you offer an opinion on a course of action, but the friends and loved ones of the person you deserted occasionally try to exact revenge.

### Too Much of a Good Thing

*There is attractive, and then there’s you.*

You look good, even in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. It might be due to your super-human powers, a lucky roll of the genetic dice, or all of the work you had done before Z-Day.

Unfortunately, people equate your looks with your intelligence and general level of skill, figuring your IQ equals your shoe size. Either that, or you must deal with a string of unwanted suitors or people trying to protect you from harm, lest your good looks become tarnished.

### Unlucky 

*Lady Luck wants to see you get eaten by zombies.*

You can’t put your finger on it, but you just have the worst luck. Two paths? The one you take is filled with zombies. Have a weakness? Count on it to be incorporated into the next super zombie’s costume.

### Unattractive 

*You never did look good in spandex due to that pot belly. The prescription eyeglasses don’t help either.*

For whatever reason, people that would normally be attracted to you find you homely at best and quite possibly repulsive.

### Villainous Past 

*Yes, you keep saying that the Z-Day changed everything, but you know what? I don’t care. Before the Z-Day you were an arrogant, megalomaniacal, narcissistic SOB with blood on your gloves. I still don’t trust you.*

You were a rather public and sinister supervillain before the Z-Day and you can’t shake your reputation. You are treated poorly, constantly watched, and always the first suspect whenever something bad happens that doesn’t involve zombies.

### Young Gun 

*You are so young it’s hard for others to take you seriously, as a result you constantly compensate in a desperate bid to gain respect.*

When others are watching, you are exceedingly reckless, all in an attempt to gain some level of respect. You always volunteer for dangerous missions and leap headlong into “heroic” situations.

### Xenophobia 

*You really don’t like strangers*.

You are immediately suspicious and intolerant toward anyone that isn’t part of your survivalist enclave. It takes a long time for a stranger to gain your trust.

### Zealot 

*We brought this on ourselves. Only if we truly repent and ask for forgiveness will this nightmare be over.*

Whether you were a person of faith before or found religion in the aftermath of Z-Day, you now strongly hold on to its teachings. Your faith may not be exactly what that faith taught in the Glory Days (you’ve had to interpret a lot on your own) and some of your interpretations may be quite fanciful, but you firmly believe in it. You want – need – everyone else to join you.

## Taglines

*There was another thing we all had in common; each and every one of us had a tagline. Yes, I realize it was kind of silly, and most heroes’ taglines seemed almost forced. But it was one of those unwritten traditions we all followed.*

*Back in the day, the media would do most of the work for us; I still remember how they stuck Armory with “Stand Back” after they caught him saying it on the news two times… never mind the fact that he was telling bystanders and members of his own team to basically get out of the way. But before you knew it, there he was yelling “Stand Back” right before he would let loose with some new weapon or right before he would land the telling blow.*

*We all have taglines, and the bystanders eat it up; it seems to give them some hope. At least some of us have hope left.*

### Taglines in play 

Once per scene, you may utter the tagline as you perform any action. Depending on how well you use the tagline in the moment you may get rewarded with a plot point which you may them immediately use. Make the use of a tagline dramatic! That’s what they are for.

**Example:** Velocity flashes by a super zombie, coming out of nowhere catching it and his fellow heroes by surprise.

Looking up at the Editor-in-Chief he says “Ha! You never saw that coming”, activating his tagline and getting a free Plot Point reroll.

### Choosing a Tagline 

Players should choose a tagline during character creation, or they can start play without one and allow the other players, and bystanders (aka the Editor-in-Chief) to choose one for them.

A tagline should be quick sentence or saying, a call to battle, or a quip commonly used by the Hero.

Here are some examples

“You never saw that coming” – Velocity

“Turn it up!” – Sonic Boom

“I am the night!” – The Hood

“Protectors, take them down!” – Sentinel

# The Cast

*I’m telling you I have seen some amazing things since Z-Day. Through all the blood and death, I have seen ruthless men become selfless heroes.*

*I don’t know, maybe it’s a defense mechanism, a primal need to gather, form family, and protect our fellow man. There are so few of us that maybe our inner caveman needs us to form tribes and look upon our each other as brother and sister, instead of competitors or prey.*

*Zombie survival stories are never truly about the zombies, but the survivors. These stories bring together radically different people and force them to come together, and grow closer.*

In this last step, we create those personal bonds between your heroes and the survivors under your care. Every zombie story has its supporting cast, and it’s those stories between your characters and those they care about that make *things truly matter*.  
  
Maybe you saved them. Maybe they saved you. Maybe you just haven’t gotten rid of them yet. Whatever the story, you’ve got people in your corner, friends, family, survivors, ex-sidekicks, scavengers, or weirdos who somehow make your life more complicated *and* more survivable.

Unlike character creation, creating the cast can be more collaborative effort. It should be done during Session 0, with all players together at the table, online, or via a group chat.

Once everyone is together, have each person describe one or two members of their cast. These cast members aren’t trained soldiers, elite hackers, or ex-heroes. They’re survivors. When creating a Cast member, choose one Skill Set from the Common Background List below. These are broad, grounded, and intentionally *not optimal*. They reflect common jobs, roles, or lives lived before Z-Day.

### **Common Background Skill Sets**

These Skill Sets are available to all Cast members at no cost.

- **Caretaker** (basic first aid, childcare, community support)

- **Teacher** (history, critical thinking, organizing people)

- **Handyman** (simple repair, tool use, fix-it knowledge)

- **Cook** (meal planning, food preservation, basic chemistry)

- **Custodian** (scavenging, cleaning chemicals, building familiarity)

- **Retail Worker** (bartering, crowd management, survival in chaos)

- **Farmhand** (animal handling, gardening, weather sense)

- **Librarian** (research, knowledge of obscure topics, filing systems)

- **Bus Driver** (vehicle familiarity, basic navigation)

- **Janitor** (lock keys, maintenance shortcuts, problem-solving)

- **Parent** (emotional support, multitasking, comfort)

- **Veteran** *(but not Special Forces)* (basic first aid, discipline, simple tactics, firearms safety)

### These Skill Sets only provide +1 when attempting to meet a challenge, regardless of the ability score used.

###  **Collaborative Flaws: Everyone Has Baggage**

Survivors aren’t clean slates. They come with trauma, damage, regrets, and secrets. Your Cast is no different.

Once everyone’s cast members are created, you may propose a *personality quirk* for another player's Cast member.

Something like:

- "Your sister thinks you're still a cape and keeps calling you out when you hide it."

- "Your tech guy hoards batteries. Like... weirdly hoards them."

- "The medic you saved is terrified of Zs and panics if you leave their side."

If you accept a proposed *personality quirk*, your cast member gets a skill set defined by you (replacing their common background skill set). Additionally, choose two ability scores, which grant them a +2 bonus when using either of those ability scores to meet a challenge.

This doesn’t make the character stronger in isolation; it simply makes them more interesting. The Editor-in-Chief may choose to invoke this *personality quirk* once per Issue to create drama, tension, or complication.

### **In Play**

Supporting Cast members are roleplayed by the Editor-in-Chief unless you choose to speak for them. They don’t need stat blocks unless the story demands it, and they’re not cannon fodder; losing one is like losing a piece of yourself. Treat them with care. Or don’t. That’s on you.

###  \<side bar\> **Your Crew**

In *Rotted Capes*, your hero never stands alone. *Your Crew* consists of you (your hero), any Allies or Supporting Cast you’ve defined during character creation, and in some cases, cast members who consistently operate alongside you.

Anyone in your Crew can attempt to meet a Challenge, especially a Spotlight Challenge, **i**f they’ve got the right Skill Set and narrative access.

Sometimes your medic saves the day. Sometimes it’s the gearhead fixing a downed drone. If a Challenge demands expertise, and your hero doesn’t have it, look to your Crew.

Remember, zombie apocalypse stories are not necessarily about zombies; they are about the survivors and how they navigate a world transformed by an ever-present threat. Your crew is not just a collection of background characters; they’re part of the story.
