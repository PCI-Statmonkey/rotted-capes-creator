## Hero Creation: Making a B-Lister, one step at a time. 

Before you dive headlong into the world of rotted capes, you need to
build out *who* you are playing. Were you once a scrappy sidekick to a
famous hero? The bird to someone’s bat? Or were you a young upcoming
hero seeking to join a famous league of avenging heroes? Or a
street-level hero looking to take down an organized crime syndicate? Or
maybe you took up the mask after Z’day, hoping to find the bravery to
face what lies ahead while inspiring what few survivors are left.  
  
But in the end, does it all even matter after everyone was Z’d? That’s
for you to decide.

Enough small talk.

Let’s get to work.

## Select an Origin 

What are you? Where do your powers come from?

Are you a Super-Human? Perhaps the next step of human evolution or the
result of bioengineering or a freak accident? An alien who crash-landed
on Earth and is now stranded in a strange world, struggling to survive?
Or you may be an exceptionally skilled hero relying on almost superhuman
abilities and superior training to win the day. Or a Tech Hero piloting
a custom-designed suit of power armor or utilizing a belt full of
useful, custom-made gadgetry. Or maybe your hero is a demigod, the Son
of Horus, hunting down the most dangerous prey ever to walk the earth!

Each origin grants you a bonus to your starting abilities scores, unique
advantages, and disadvantages.

## Select an Archetype 

What kind of hero are you?

Are you a powerfully built hero smashing zombie skulls with your fists
and sending them flying, or do you manifest bolts of fire blasting
things from afar? Maybe you’re a shadow, moving unseen? Maybe you are a
quick, agile scrapper with razor-sharp claws.

Each Archetype grants you a bonus to your starting ability scores and a
list of typical powers; typical powers represent your Archetype’s
bailiwick but are not the only powers they can learn.

Archetypes encompass the most general of themes. Don’t be discouraged if
the exact Hero you had envisioned does not fall neatly into any of these
categories. Just pick the best fit and move on from there.

## Determine your ability scores. 

Your ability scores represent your hero’s attributes, how strong, fast,
quick, a wise they are.

Here you are given some points to buy your scores across 6 ability
scores Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, and
Charisma. After which, you apply the bonus granted by both your
archetypes and origin.

## Choose your skills & feats.

What does your hero know how to do? Maybe they have some medical
training or know their way around an old diesel engine.

Here you get several points to buy skill training, focusing on an aspect
of a skill, or learning a feat.

## Choose your Powers. 

So, what can your hero do? Do they have telekinetic powers? Are you an
ex-super spy with training that borders on the unnatural? An
ex-billionaire playboy philanthropist flying around in a suit of armor
now being held together by duct tape and positive thoughts?

You get a number of points to buy your powers and determine their
starting power score. Afterward, you may apply power perks and flaws,
increasing or decreasing each power’s final power score.

## Do you have a weakness?

Is your hero violently allergic to a rare kind of metal? Do all your
powers suddenly burn out when hit with a Sonic attack? Or maybe your
hero has an uncontrollable fear of heights.

Each weakness grants you the choice of an ability score bonus, power
score bonus, or a feat. If you do not want a weakness, you can skip this
step.

## The Finishing Touches.

Almost there….

Here you choose your starting gear, determine your defenses, pace,
starting vitality, wounds, and two of the most important details like
your *character’s flaws* and your *tagline.*

## The Supporting Cast 

You’re a hero but not alone; people have a habit of following heroes.
Maybe you saved them from a pack of z’s, and maybe they saved you.
Regardless you are in this together.

Here you create your supporting cast, each with their skills and
training. Useful? Yes, but sometimes they can be a liability, and such
is the life of a hero.

# Origins 

Your Origin defines the source of your extraordinary abilities and the
means through which you achieve your heroic feats. You might be a
supremely skilled hero, relying on nearly superhuman talents and
rigorous training to triumph. Alternatively, you could be a Tech Hero,
commanding a suit of power armor or wielding an arsenal of specially
designed gadgets. Or perhaps you are a Super-Human, either the product
of advanced bio-engineering or the outcome of a fateful, transformative
accident, or just representing the next stage in human evolution.

Each power source grants the hero unique advantages and disadvantages
and a bonus to a specific attribute.

Origins are not the only source of your heroes’ powers. You may have
other powers gained through other means, such as being a super-human
with enhanced speed and agility wielding wrist blasters made of some
alien tech.

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride-along: choosing your hero’s Origin.*  
Ruben is a big fan of heroes who use Telekinetic powers, so he chooses
to go with the super-human Origin.

Ruben sees he gets +2 to his constitution. His advantage grants him +1
to all powers or a power feat of his choice; he will choose which later.
His disadvantage is Power Limits. He can only gain new inborn powers
after hero creation if they are mastered emulated powers.

Nani is a particular fan of Norse mythology, so she chooses to go with
Demi-god.

Nani gets a +1 bonus to any two ability scores or +2 to one. She chooses
+1 to Strength and Constitution and notes that her divine blood
advantage grants her a free feat *power surge*. And notes down her
disadvantage of Divine Power Limits, noting that she can’t gain new
inborn powers after character creation, but she can have powers tied to
one supernatural object.

\</side bar\>

## Alien

You are not of this world. Whether you hail from a distant planet, are a
member of an extraterrestrial race, or from another dimension, your
origins lie beyond. Your alien nature grants you unique abilities and
perspectives that set you apart from humanity.

Perhaps you arrived on Earth as an ambassador of your people, or maybe
you were stranded here, your spacecraft damaged beyond repair, forcing
you to adapt to survive. Regardless of the circumstances, you are now a
stranger in a strange land, facing the dual challenges of the zombie
apocalypse and the mysteries of this new world.

Your alien heritage brings both advantages and challenges. You may
possess advanced technology, telepathic abilities, or physical
attributes beyond human limits. However, you also grapple with the
struggle of finding your place among humans, building trust, and
understanding their customs and culture.  
  
**Ability Score Bonus:**

As an Alien, your unique physiology grants you enhanced physical
attributes. You gain a +2 bonus to your Strength score.  
  
**Unique Advantages:**

*Alien Resilience:* Your alien physiology grants you natural resistance
to physical harm. You have an innate Damage Resistance (DR) of 1 against
all physical damage, which stacks with any other sources of DR.
Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against poisons.

*Advanced Technology:* Your knowledge and access to advanced alien
technology provide you with unique tools and gadgets. Any powers that
apply the removable item power modification have their power scores
increased by +1.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Cultural Misunderstanding:* Your alien nature and cultural background
may lead to misunderstandings and difficulties in interacting with
humans. You have a disadvantage on Insight checks when trying to
understand human behavior and social cues. Additionally, specific
actions or customs that are commonplace for your alien race may be seen
as strange or alarming to humans, potentially leading to tension or
hostility.

*Lost Connection:* Being trapped on Earth during the zombie apocalypse
has severed your ties to your alien home world. You no longer have
access to the resources and support from your alien civilization. Any
attempt to contact or seek assistance from your home world is uncertain
at best.

**Origin Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg.
xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you
do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose

> to function at the end of the scene.

## Android

You are some form of mechanical creation, be it a self-aware robot, an
artificially-constructed human, or even a human brain in a cybernetic
body. You have an inorganic makeup and are relatively immune to most
diseases. Making you a *very* valuable member of any enclave. However,
that said….

\<side bar\>

Editor’s Note:  
Being immune to infection may make the Android *too* effective for the
zombie apocalypse. You may want to consider the possibility of a
machine-based virus allowing for mechanical zombies. See “Zombies and
Non-Humans,” p. XX, for more options.

\</side bar\>

**Ability Score Bonus:**

Androids are a varied lot, but their digital minds allow them to recall
information with ease. You gain +2 to your Intelligence score.

**Unique Advantages:**

*Artificial Mind:* being an artificial life form, you are not
susceptible to emotions that drive carbon-based life forms. As such, you
cannot be easily frightened; you gain a +5 bonus to saving throws and a
+2 bonus to your willpower defense when resisting the effects of
psychosis or any effect that would frighten you.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Lack of Emotion:* you suffer a -5 penalty on all insight rolls to read
another’s emotional state.

**Origin Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg.
xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you
do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose
A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
|-----------------------------------|
| Adaptive Learning                 |

| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
| Combat Computer                   |
| Digital Mind Interface            |
| Tactical Combat Records           |

#### B-Lister Rank Origin Features 

**Adaptive Learning:** You become trained in one skill.

**Adaptive Modifications:** Increase your Intelligence score and another
ability score of your choice by 1. You may take this feature multiple
times.

**Data Analysis:** Your digital mind excels at analyzing patterns and
gathering information. You gain a +2 bonus to Investigation and Insight
checks. You may take this feature multiple times, increasing the bonus
by +1 each additional time you take this feature to a maximum of +5.

**Enhanced Capabilities:** Increase the power score of any two of your
inborn powers by 1. You may take this feature multiple times.

**Enhanced Durability:** You have DR: 1 vs. all physical damage. This DR
stacks with DR from other sources.

**Enhanced Strength:** You possess incredible strength, allowing you to
lift and carry heavy objects easily. Your strength score is doubled to
determine how much you can lift, carry, or drag. You also have advantage
on Strength checks and saving throws.

**Self-Repair:** Your android body can repair itself over time. When you
heal a wound, you heal two instead.

#### A-Lister Rank Origin Features

**Combat Computer:** As a bonus action, you can dedicate most of your
processing power to your combat computer, allowing it to take control.
While in your combat computer is active, the following benefits apply
for 1 minute:

- *Advantage on Attacks:* You gain advantage on all attack rolls.

- *Precision:* Your attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage of the same
  type.

- *Unreal Reflexes:* you gain a +1 bonus to your Avoidance.

> After using this feature, you wait 1 week before using it again. You
> may retake this feature when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category,
> reducing the time between uses to a long rest.

**Digital Mind Interface:** You can wirelessly connect to computer
systems to easily access information and control technology. You gain
the Wireless power at a power score equal to your Intelligence score. If
you already have the wireless power, increase your power score in that
power by +4 if the score is higher than your intelligence score.

**Tactical Combat Records:** After fighting someone for 2 rounds, you
gain a +1 bonus to hit and a +1 bonus to your defenses against that
creature. You may retain data on as many creatures as your intelligence
bonus.

## Cosmic

You can tap into and channel the energies that permeate the universe.
How you gained these powers is up to you, but you might possess an alien
artifact that draws upon such energies or may someone have granted you
these powers to help keep law and order in this small section of the
universe. However, despite your origin, you’re still a B-Lister and only
possess a fraction of the power cosmically enhanced A-Listers can sling
around. In other words, no flying through space unaided, defending
entire solar systems all by yourself, or destroying starships with a
single energy blast. And worse yet, you’re now trapped in a world
overrun by the living dead. Your starship may be damaged, your
interstellar flight ring has gone missing, or with your mentor gone, you
have sworn to eradicate the zombie threat in their memory.

The reason doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you’re in for the
long haul and are here to stay.

**Ability Bonus:**  
Comic beings come in many shapes, but the rigors of being a vessel for
such power demand a level of durability. You gain +1 to your
Constitution and one other ability score of your choice.

**Unique Advantages:**

*Limitless Cosmic Power:* The energies that permeate the universe are
nigh inexhaustible. You receive the *Increased Burnout* Power Feat.
Additionally, all your inborn powers are Cosmic in nature.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Power Limits:* While you have access to unending cosmic energy, you
*don’t* have an unending suite of powers to call upon. You can only gain
new inborn powers through mastering emulated powers based on your
existing inborn powers.

Later, with Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may acquire new powers,
but none of them can be Inborn powers; they must be made available
through technology, supernatural, or some other external source. Certain
story-based events, such as exposure to a nuclear reactor, massive
amounts of solar radiation, or other such esoteric energies, *may* allow
you to acquire new inborn powers.

**Origin Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg.
xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you
do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose
A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
|-----------------------------------|
| Cosmic Adaptation                 |
| Cosmic Awareness                  |
| Cosmic Ascendance                 |
| Cosmic Evolution                  |
| Cosmic Resistance                 |
| Infinite Cosmic Power             |
| Power Mastery                     |
| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
| Cosmic Entanglement               |
| Cosmic Transformation             |
| Stellar Manipulation              |

#### B-Lister Level Origin Features 

**Cosmic Adaptation:** Adapt to various environments and conditions in
space, such as extreme temperatures or lack of oxygen. You gain the
power of Life Support: 40. This power is limited to space, allowing you
to exist and operate in the extreme temperatures and vacuum of space.

**Cosmic Awareness:** Your connection to the cosmos grants you
heightened senses and the ability to detect hidden threats or sources of
power. You can sense the use of cosmic-based powers or events within a
number of miles equal to your wisdom bonus. You can gauge the general
power level classification of the cosmic event with a successful Wisdom
Check vs. a DC: 20, -5 for each power level classification above Gamma,
so gauging a Theta level event would require a DC 5 Charisma Check.

**Cosmic Ascendance:** Increase the power score of any two of your
cosmic powers by +1. You may take this feature multiple times.

> **Cosmic Evolution:** Increase your Constitution score and another
> ability score of your choice by 1. You may take this feature multiple
> times.

**Cosmic Resistance:** You have DR 1 vs. cosmic-based attacks and
effects, stacks with other effects. You may choose this feature more
than once, gaining a +1 each additional time you take this feature to a
maximum of +5.

**Infinite Cosmic Power:** Increase your burnout threshold by 2

**Power Mastery:** Choose a power feat.

#### A-Lister Level Origin Features

**Cosmic Entanglement:** All cosmic-level heroes tap into the same
reserves. You have learned how to manipulate the flow of the cosmic,
empowering or disempowering those around you that tap into that power.
Once per scene, as a bonus action, when within 2 areas of another
cosmic-powered creature, you may modify the power score of any of their
Cosmic themed powers by +2 or -2 until the end of their next turn.

**Cosmic Transformation:** Tapping into the cosmic power, you unleash
your true potential and undergo a temporary transformation. You can
activate Cosmic Transformation as a bonus action. While in your cosmic
form, the following benefits apply for 1 minute:

- *Advantage on Attacks:* You gain advantage on all attack rolls.

- *Resilience:* You have advantage on all saving throws and ability
  checks.

- *Cosmic Overcharge:* Choose one of your cosmic powers, and that
  power’s score is increased by +4

> After using this feature, you wait 1 week before using it again. You
> may retake this feature when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category,
> reducing the time between uses to a long rest.

**Stellar Manipulation:** Harness the power of stars to unleash
devastating energy attacks. You gain the Energy Manipulation (Cosmic)
power with a power score equal to your Charisma score. If you already
have the Energy Manipulation (Cosmic) power, increase your power score
in that power by +4 if the score is higher than your Charisma score.

## Demigod

You are a ‘divine’ being. Or at least you claim to be. It is possible
you’re the result of the union between a god and a mortal, or you may be
the avatar of such a being, sent to Earth to work its will. Before
Z-Day, other superheroes figured you were either a powerful alien, a
deluded mutant, another form of superhuman, a visitor from another
dimension, or a walking example of ‘any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic.’ After Z-Day, all that mattered was
that you were alive and could deal with the zombie threat.

**Ability Bonus:**  
Demigods are as different as the deities of the varied pantheons as
such, you get a +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice or +1 to
any two ability scores of your choice.

**Unique Advantages:**

*Divine Blood, Divine Power:* as a demigod, you possess a mystical and
physical connection to the essence of your divine lineage, which allows
you to push beyond the limits of mere mortals. You receive the *Power
Surge* Power Feat.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Divine Power Limits:* After character creation, at least half of your
powers must be Inborn Powers, with all other powers being tied to one
supernatural object. You can only gain new inborn powers through
mastering emulated powers based on your existing inborn powers.

Later, with Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may acquire new powers,
but none of them can be Inborn powers; they must be made available
through technology, supernatural, or some other external source. Of
course, certain story-based events tied to your Demigod’s mythological
theme may allow you to gain new inborn powers.

**Origin Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg.
xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you
do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose
A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
|-----------------------------------|
| Divine Ascendance                 |
| Divine Blessing                   |
| Divine Bloodline                  |
| Divine Presence                   |
| Divine Sense                      |

| Unearthly Speed                   |
| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
| Divine Intervention               |
| Divine Transformation             |
| Divine Resistance                 |

#### B-Lister Level Origin Features 

**Divine Ascendance:** Increase the power score of any two of your
inborn powers by 1. You may take this feature multiple times.

**Divine Blessing:** The gods smile upon you, granting you a permanent
boon. Choose one of the following benefits: +1 bonus to avoidance, +1
grit, or +1 to all attack rolls. This benefit cannot be changed once
chosen.

**Divine Bloodline:** Increase the ability score or scores modified by
your origin during hero creation by 2 or 1, respectively. You may take
this feature multiple times. For example, if you choose to increase
Strength by +2 during hero creation, you gain a +2 to strength when
choosing this feature.

**Divine Presence:** Your presence exudes an aura of power and
authority, influencing the behavior of others and benefiting in social
interactions. You gain a +2 bonus on all influence skill checks. You may
take this feature multiple times, gaining a +1 each additional time you
take this feature to a maximum of +5.

**Divine Sense:** Your connection to the divine allows you to sense the
presence of undead creatures. You have a +5 bonus on Perception skill
checks to detect undead and can detect their presence within 30 feet,
even through walls and obstacles.

**Enhanced Strength:** You possess incredible strength, allowing you to
lift and carry heavy objects easily. Your strength score is doubled to
determine how much you can lift, carry, or drag. You also have advantage
on Strength checks and saving throws.

**Unearthly Speed:** Your unearthly agility and reflexes grant you
incredible speed. You can now apply your total dexterity modifier to
your pace score (ignoring the cap of 5 areas). Additionally, you may
increase your pace by 1 area or gain a +1 to your avoidance. You can
choose this feature twice to gain both options.

#### A-Lister Level Origin Features

**Divine Intervention:** You can call upon the divine power within you
to alter the course of events. When making a saving throw, you can
choose to roll with advantage. You regain the use of this feature after
completing a long rest.

**Divine Transformation:** Embracing your divine lineage, you can tap
into your true potential and undergo a temporary transformation. You can
activate Divine Transformation as a bonus action. While in your divine
form, the following benefits apply for 1 minute:

- *Advantage on Attacks:* You gain advantage on all attack rolls.

- *Resilience:* You have advantage on all saving throws and ability
  checks.

- *Divine Weaponry:* When attacking with a weapon or unarmed attack,
  once per turn, you deal an additional 1d6 damage.

> After using this feature, you wait 1 week before using it again. You
> may retake this feature when you reach Theta (rank 6) Level Category,
> reducing the time between uses to a long rest.

**Divine Resistance:** Your divine heritage grants you resistance to a
specific damage type associated with your divine parentage. Choose one
damage type (e.g., fire, lightning, necrotic) and gain DR 2 against that
damage type. You may take this feature multiple times, gaining a +1 each
additional time you take this feature to a maximum of +5.

## Highly Trained 

Yes, it was hard for you to make a name for yourself; you can’t fly,
dodge bullets, or build a battle suit that would have allowed you to
face down the likes of the Raptor or Inferno, but what you lacked in raw
power you more than made up for in hard earned skill.

At one time, you may have been a highly trained field agent for the NSA
or The Division, or maybe you were a uniquely gifted martial artist
trained in almost forgotten techniques by a solitary master, or perhaps
you were a rich millionaire utilizing almost limitless resources,
ruthless training, and an unbreakable will to forge yourself into more
than an ordinary man.

Regardless of how you trained your body to become the hero you are
today, you face a threat you could have never foreseen. And you thought
you had it hard when your enemies were breathing…

**Ability Bonus:** Skill-based heroes are a varied lot; they gain a +1
bonus to any three attributes of their choice.

**Unique Advantages:**

*My knowledge is my power:* You gain 10 additional points to buy skills
or feats. Also, unlike other Heroes, you may purchase up to three skill
sets. You also gain a bonus Feat (see Feats pg. XX) of your choice
except for Visionary.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Only Human:* You are ultimately only human; you may never increase your
physical attributes (before applying powers such as Enhanced Ability
Score) beyond 20.

*No Powers:* You do not possess any inborn powers; therefore, any power
must be skill-based or the result of specialized equipment. Powers
marked with a (\*) in Archetypes and later in the Powers section may be
attributed to specialized training. If you choose these as powers, they
must possess the *All Skill* Power Modification. Any other powers are
the product of custom technology; thus, they must have the *External
Power Source* and the *Cybernetic Implants* or *Removable Item* Power
Modifications.

*New Power Limitations:* You may only learn new powers as skill-based
powers; alternately, with the Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may
acquire new powers through special equipment, implants, or from some
event.

**Origin Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg.
xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you
do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose
A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

| **B-Lister Rank Origin Features** |

| Acrobatic Mastry                  |
| Advanced Training                 |

| Skill Mastery                     |
| Skill Training                    |
| Tactical Analysis                 |
| Tactical Maneuvers                |
| **A-Lister Rank Origin Features** |
| Flawless Execution                |
| Flow state                        |
| Resourcefulness                   |

#### B-Lister Level Origin Features 

**Acrobatic Mastery:** Your exceptional agility and acrobatic skills
allow you to navigate the battlefield with finesse. You gain advantage
on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and may take the disengage action as a
bonus action.

**Advanced Training:** Choose a feat; you may take this feature multiple
times.

**Focused Training:** You may acquire any three skill foci in skills you

## Mystic

You are one of the rarest heroes, a mystic arts practitioner, or a
mystic power wielder. You Might be a magician calling ancient powers and
bending them to your will, or an ancient artifact may have chosen you to
wield its power for a greater purpose, or a master of mystical gadgetry.

Before Z-Day, you may have used your knowledge to fight crime under the
guise of a stage magician, acted as a private investigator of the
occult, or defended the Earth from extradimensional invaders. You may
have even taken to wearing a colorful costume and fighting alongside
more traditional (at least in the public mind) heroes. In any event, you
were considered an oddity, even among the other heroes. Scientists may
try and quantify your power source, while others would dismiss your
clams as theater to invoke your heroic persona. But after Z-Day, does it
matter anymore? Depending on the cause of the Zombie Apocalypse chosen
by the Editor, you may be one of the people best equipped to deal with
the apocalypse. Zombies (and other forms are undead) are often par for
the course for many mystic masters.

The problem here, however, is that there are so many zombies. More
unsettling is the silence that has settled onto the supernatural side of
the world. You would have thought the deaths of so many would have
caused an increase in apparitions and ghosts of the world. Instead,
there is an uneasy quiet. In addition, you can now “feel” the waves of
mystic power far more quickly than before as it flows readily through
you. It is so accessible that you’d think it was building itself up in
anticipation, but for what?

### Superheroic Sorcery

At first glance, superheroes and sorcery may seem like an odd mix, but
magic-using and magic-powered superheroes date back to the first
costumed crime fighters. Thus, when playing *Rotted Capes,* you and the
Editor-in-Chief must consider the nature of magic and magical characters
in your campaign.

For starters, superheroic magicians tend to look and dress differently
than your typical costumed crime fighter. Skin-tight costumes tend to be
reasonably rare, replaced with trench coats, tunics, top hats, capes and
cloaks, and so on. And even if they wear a skin-tight costume, the
superheroic sorcerer tends to have or use some distinctive artifact that
marks them as a magician, such as an enchanted helmet, a “spell sword,”
or a power-channeling staff. Finally, such heroes also have codenames
that reflect the nature of their powers. For example, there are a *lot*
of Doctors slinging spells in the comics.

Next, we need to consider the nature of superheroic spellcasting. Much
of it tends to be akin to *thaumaturgy* or “wonder-working.” In other
words, comic book magicians work miracles through their spells and
spellcraft. However, very few comic book magicians cast their spells the
same way as other magicians. Usually, each hero has a specific technique
for creating their magical effects. Some speak their spells backward,
saying “tlob gninthgil!” when they want to produce a bolt of
electricity. Others use alliterative phrasing, calling upon “hoary
hosts” and the like.

Still, others channel their magic through specific objects, such as
wands, the aforementioned enchanted helmet, or amulets. By determining
this, you start to bring your hero to life and differentiate them from
regular costumed supers and other magically-powered characters. That
said, first check with your Editor-in-Chief to see if he has any
specific ideas on how magic works in his game. He may give you his
outlines for spells or, better yet, might take your ideas and adopt them
whole cloth.

Once you know how you cast spells, you need to decide what your spells
look like. As comics are a visual medium, comic book super mages tend to
have showy side effects to their spells. When creating magic, their
hands are often surrounded by such effects as great globes of light,
bands or rings, elaborate mandalas, or intricate patterns of lines.
Magical artifacts glow when used, often with unusual or unnatural
colors.

Combat spells tend to go beyond the “mundane” energy/ element blasts of
regular superheroes. They may manifest as a multitude of energy darts, a
burning animal shape, or any number of similar effects. Defensive spells
often spark or shine when struck or radiate the same effects mentioned
when creating spells if an attack hits home.

Another thing to consider is that, unlike regular superheroes, super
mages aren’t manipulating real-world energies. They’re working with
magical energies, which means they can do things in highly
unconventional ways. For example, a regular superhero may perform a
Geospatial Shift by traveling at super speed, manipulating time, or
converting their mass to energy and back again. On the other hand, a
super mage may cut a rift in the “veil between worlds,” shift from our
world to a different dimension, and then back, or simply will themselves
there. These kinds of effects apply to *everything* a superheroic
magician can do and go hand-in-hand with the idea that superheroic spell
casting needs to be showy and visually distinct.

Of course, in a zombie apocalypse, showy spell casting might *not* be
the best of ideas, as it might draw unwanted attention to you and your
companions, but that’s the price you pay for mastery of the mystic arts.

\</Side Bar\>

**There are three basic types of mystic heroes:**

*Practitioners* are the magi, the wielders of magic. These heroes derive
their powers through mystical rituals requiring an almost inhuman
dedication.

*The Chosen* are those heroes who have been blessed by either mystical
beings from beyond the planes of man or those who have been chosen by a
powerful magical item that empowers them with their abilities.

*Enchanters* are those heroes who come at magic differently, sometimes
called *mystic gadgeteers.* These heroes create fantastic instruments
which are cable of doing fantastic things.

### Practitioners

**Ability Bonus:**

*Practitioners* get where they are through constant study and
self-Willpower, which allows them a +2 to their Charisma score.

**Unique Advantages:**

*Bell, Book, And Candle:* To represent your training in the mystic arts,
you get a +1 bonus to your Grit and *must* purchase the Occultist Skill
Set (see page XX) during character creation, for which you receive a
5-point discount. In addition, you also gain the *Eclectic Knowledge*
feat for free.  
  
*Spell Slinger:* As a wielder of the mystic arts, you do not possess
powers, but rather cast spells. When choosing a power, it is instead
considered a spell and must have the Magical Spell perk (see page xx).
Spells that you have memorized or otherwise know are considered inborn
powers. All other spells must have the removable flaw, such as they are
written in a tome or linked to an object that could be lost mid battle.
When casting a spell, you may choose to increase the speed of a power by
one action type (i.e. from Bonus Action to Action) increasing the spells
power by +2, alternately you can speed up the casting of a spell by one
step (i.e. from Action to Bonus Action) decreasing the spells power
score by -4.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Only Human:* Despite your mystic Might, you’re ultimately only human;
you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before the
application of powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.

*Gremlins:* All mystic heroes seem to have problems with technology;
mystic heroes gain Gremlins as an additional personality flaw, your
editor-in-chief may activate this flaw to refuse its affects you must
spend a plot point.

*Limits of Knowledge:* While it may be easier for you to learn new
powers through acquiring and mastering new spells, finding new spells
has become all but impossible. You may only learn new spells once you
have found a complete copy of a spell. The power it may grant you is
entirely in the hands of the Editor-in-Chief. Other than new spells, you
may only learn new powers if they are powers with the all-skill power
modification.

### Enchanters 

**Ability Bonus:**

*Enchanters* see the world in ways others cannot even phantom; thus,
they gain +2 to their Intelligence score.

**Unique Advantages:**

*Techomage:* You possess an unparalleled mind for the occult and mystech
(mystical technology). You gain skill focus basic engineering and any
two of occult’s fields of study.

*So many toys:* your powers come from multiple pieces of equipment that
share one power source: you. During hero creation, all your powers must
result from items; as such, your powers can not have the external power
source power modifications and must possess the Removable Item power
modification (fully explained under powers pg. XX). Additionally, you
may learn the power Inventive Gadgetry, items created through the use of
this power do not have the external power source power modification.
Instead, they tap into your arcane power; as such, you pay the burnout
cost when activating the item's power.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Only Human:* Despite your mystic might, you’re ultimately only human;
you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before applying
powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.

*Techno-Shaman:* Technology reaches out for you. Unexplained
technological phenomenon springs up wherever you go. You might be able
to work wonders with a computer, but that computer is just as likely to
turn on you. Beware, for there are ghosts in the machine who are hungry
for someone like you, someone attuned to their world, your
editor-in-chief may activate this flaw to refuse its affects you must
spend a plot point.

### The Chosen

**Ability Bonus:**

*The Chosen* are typically selected because they possess an unorthodox
way of seeing things; thus, they gain +2 to their Wisdom score.

**Unique Advantages**

*Destiny is All:* you’re constantly resisting the urges and demands of
your item/Patrion; as such, you gain a +1 bonus to your Grit.
Additionally, you gain the *Diehard* feat for free.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Only Human:* Despite your mystic might, you’re ultimately only human;
you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before the
application of powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.

*Gremlins:* All mystic heroes seem to have problems with technology;
mystic heroes gain Gremlins as an additional personality flaw, your
editor-in-chief may activate this flaw to refuse its affects you must
spend a plot point.

*A Set Path:* Either all powers you gain through Hero creation are tied
to a magic item in your possession which must have the External Power
Source modification, or a particular Patron grants you your powers and
must have the Patron modification. You may only learn new powers if they
are granted to you by your patron (with the editor’s approval) which can
be acquired with the Acquire New Power feat or as in the from new
equipment or acquiring powers with the all-skill power modification.

**Origin Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg.
xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you
do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose
A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

## Super-Human 

You may have been born with your powers, seeing them develop over time,
or be a result of scientific experimentation. Perhaps you were one of
those rare Super- Humans resulting from a “lucky accident,” simply in
the right place at the wrong time, triggering what has been referred to
as the Ultra-Gene.

Before Z-Day, all you had to worry about were “super-villains” or ‘Gene
purists”. However, with Z-Day has come a disturbing phenomenon: some
Super-Humans who possessed the Ultra gene do not simply become zombies,
but twisted malign versions of themselves, with all ability to tell
right from wrong erased from their psyche.

**Ability Bonus:** Super-Humans are heartier than normal humans. You
gain +2 to your Constitution score.

**Unique Advantages:**

*Super:* Because of who and what you are, after hero creation, raise the
power scores of all your inborn powers by 1. These powers must be
inborn. (Inborn powers are simply powers that are not reliant on an
outside source, in other words, part of the hero’s physiology.) or you
may gain one power feat of your choice.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Power Limits*: Super-Humans are born with specific Ultra genes, which
dictate the powers they can develop. You can only gain new inborn powers
through mastering emulated powers.

Later, with the Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may have your Hero
acquire new powers, but they must be made available through technology,
supernatural, or some story-based event.

## Supernatural

You are possibly the strangest form of costumed hero—a supernatural
being. You may be the ghost of someone slain before Z-Day (or *after*),
the physical manifestation of some aspect of the natural world, a heroic
vampire who fights the urge to drink the blood of the living, or someone
infected with lycanthropy, assuming the form of a bear, tiger, wolf or
other beast at will.

Before Z-Day, you almost certainly operated from the shadows, fighting
criminals and other menaces without drawing too much attention to
yourself. If you belonged to a super team, you avoided the spotlight and
tended to be somewhat cryptic about your origins and nature. Now,
*after* Z-Day, you are conflicted. You can certainly use your powers to
help the scattered enclaves and survivors, but will they accept your
help? Or will they look at you as just another zombie?

**Ability Bonus:**

Supernatural heroes are rather varied in origin and nature. You gain a
+1 bonus to two ability scores of your choice.

**Unique Advantages:**

*More Than Human:* As supernatural heroes tend to be hard to hurt, you

weaknesses.

something you are vulnerable to. You must take a thematically
appropriate *vulnerability* weakness (later in this chapter) worth at
least 10 points; you do not gain any bonuses for this weakness. Although
you may still choose and benefit from additional weaknesses.

**Origin Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg.

do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose

## Techno Hero

Back during the “Glory Days” you did well for yourself, using either
your superior intellect or impressive resources to create your heroic
persona. You might have a suit of power armor once designed for military
applications, maybe you made a new scientific breakthrough, or you might
just be an exceptional archer with a quiver of specialized arrows and
the ability to scavenge like no other.

Back when you had a workshop you were always able to keep your gear in
tip top shape, but after everything fell apart you were lucky to have
power, let alone a high powered plasma cutter. Now you simply make due,
find what you can, make it work, and move on. What other choice do you
have?

**Ability Bonus:** Tech Heroes are generally geniuses; you gain +2 to
your Intelligence score.

**Unique Advantages:**

*Technopath:* You possess an unparalleled mind for technology. You
*must* purchase the Engineer skill set, for which you receive a 5-point
discount. You also gain the *Visionary* Feat for free.

*Self-Made Hero!* As a result of technology, with the exception of the
Manifest Gear and the Inventive Gadgetry, any power you take must
possess a number of power modifications (fully explained under powers
pg. XX).

- All of your powers must have either the All-Skill, Cybernetic Implant,
  Removable Item, or Power Armor Power Modifications.

- Powers utilizing the Cybernetic Implant or Removable Item Power
  Modifications must also possess the External Power Source.

- All external power sources have their burnout threshold increased by
  your Intelligence modifier.

**Unique Disadvantages:**

*Only Human:* You are ultimately only human; you may never increase your
base physical ability scores (before the application of powers such as
Enhanced Ability scores) beyond 20.

*Unreliable at the best of times:* At any time, once per scene, the
Editor-in-Chief may decide that a piece of your tech or an external
power source just fails to work. This may be applied only to a single
power. You may spend a Plot Point to negate this result.

**Origin Features:** As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg.
xx) at specific levels you will be granted Origin Features, when you do,
choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose
A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

parameters. As a bonus action, roll a 2d6 and add that result to the

must wait 1 week before using this feature again.

the exact Hero you had envisioned does not fall neatly into any of these
categories. Just pick the best fit and move on from there.

When you choose an Archetype, you gain a bonus to a particular attribute
and a list of Typical Powers*.*

**Typical Powers** list of suggested powers for your Archetype, these

in. As a kinetic of any kind, you have just learned to crush or throw

# Ability Scores 

Ability scores measure your hero’s physical and mental characteristics,
how smart, quick, or witty they are. There are 6 Ability Scores:
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well as
weaknesses. A hero’s defenses, vitality, wounds, pace, and number of
starting skills all rely on these ability scores. These scores are your
baseline scores before the application of any powers if any.

Where the common bystander generally possesses scores of 8 to 10 in most
attributes, a B-Lister’s attributes can range anywhere from 8 to 18.
There are heroes who are exceptionally powerful in a single attribute
which is augmented through powers, even these B-Listers highest score
generally stays in the low 20’s. Refer to the *Ability and Power Scores

# Starting Skills, Feats, and Maneuvers.

Skills are a crucial aspect of your character's abilities, showcasing
your expertise in various fields of study and specialized training. They
encompass many proficiencies, from driving to engineering and history.
You can choose from a list of skills focused on many skills. Skill
focuses allow you to emphasize a specific aspect of the skill. Your
skill choices will play a significant role in defining your character's
strengths and capabilities.

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride along: Skills*  
both players start with two skills and a feat, they also gain 20 points
to buy additional skills or feats.

Ruben decides that his character was a detective before Z’day, so he
picks the Local Knowledge and Basic Technology skills as his two bonus
skills and buys the Detective Skill Set which costs 14 points, he spends
one point to learn Urban Survival and decides to use his last 5 points
on getting an additional feat.

Ruben notes that he acquired the feats Empathic Intuition, Investigator
and picks Owl Eyed as his bonus feat, after which he spends his last 5
points to pick Leaf Upon the Wind feat, and finally he chooses the
Increase Burnout Threshold feat as his free power feat from his Origin.

Nani decides her character was aways a hero and picks Drive and Local
Knowledge as her starting skills and selects both the Law Enforcement
skill set (costing 6 points) and Ex- Military (costing 12 points) skill
set leaving her with 2 points she uses on skills picking up Occult and
Outdoorsmen.

Combining her skill sets Nani finds that Athletics is granted in both
skill sets, giving her a free skill focus in one of Athletics’ fields of
study. She chooses to be focused in Athletics (Jumping)

Nani notes that she acquired Learn Maneuver twice and Seasoned Survivor
though her skill sets, she chooses the unique device feat for her sword
as her bonus feat. Looking over maneuvers she picks Devastating Attack
and Team Attack.

\</side bar\>

### Selecting your skills and feats 

All heroes start with

- You are trained with two (2) of the following skills: Athletics,
  Drive, Local Knowledge, Basic Technology, Basic Engineering, or Urban
  Survival.

- You gain one (1) feat of your choice (see pg XX for feats)

- You gain one (1) maneuver of your choice (see pg XX for maneuvers)

<!-- -->

- You now have 20 points to buy your hero’s starting skills and feats.

  - You can buy up to 2 skill sets, highly trained heroes can buy 3.

  - Buying training in a single skills costs 1 point.

  - You can buy a feat for 5 points.

- If you gain a skill more than once through any source (say the Drive
  skill as part of your starting skills and again as part of a skill
  set), you gain skill focus in that skill or a related field of study,
  if applicable.

- If you gain the same feat twice through skill sets, you may choose any
  other non-power feat in place of one of them.

**\<Side bar\>**

**Choosing Skills to Fit a Particular Theme**  
Don't feel limited by a skill set's name. For example, if you want to
create a hero who was once a psychologist, you can choose the Public
Relations/Con Artist skill set and become trained in Science
(Psychology). If you want to create a commercial pilot, you could select
either the Academic/Student or Business Professional skill set and take
the Pilot skill. Skill sets shouldn't restrict you; if none fit your
hero, purchase the skills that suit your vision.

**Skill Focus:** If a skill has fields of study, you may gain skill
focus in one of those fields. If it does not, you may gain focus on the
skill itself. You gain Advantage on all checks with the chosen skill or
field of study. During character creation, there are two ways to get
skill focus: either by getting a feat that grants it or by getting the
same skill twice via skill sets; you can’t buy a skill twice to get
skill focus.

## Starting languages 

You are considered to be literate and fluent in your native language.
Through linguistic skill, you can learn additional languages.

Below is a list of available skill sets. Skill sets are a collection of
skills and feats you acquire at a discount. Skills noted with an • you
gain skill focus in that skill or related fields of study, if

#  Starting Powers

*Powers are the extraordinary abilities that set us apart from the
regular folk, before all we had to worry about was those powers in the
wrong hands, and we had our hands full with them. Now we have Super Z’s
to worry about. But it’s not them that I worry the most about, they are
so territorial you can keep clear of them if ya need too. I worry about
those who use their powers raid enclaves for their resources while put
regular folk under heal in exchange for their “protection”*

During this step you will precocious your powers. Powers like Ability
scores have a Power Score that can range from 10 upwards. Although there
are reports of bystanders and epsilon level heroes possessing powers
with a power scores of 9 and below, but B-Listers will commonly start
with powers ranging from 10 to 20, before power modifications, with some
exceptions.

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride along: Starting Powers*  
Ruben chooses to go with the point buy option, he picks the powers of
personal force field, move object, and Energy Blast choosing Kinetic has
his damage type. He has 32 points to buy power scores and ends up with
personal force field:16, move object:16, and Energy Blast (Kinetic): 17,
chooses to have all the powers *linked* boosting them to 18, 18, and 19
respectively.

Nani want to just to hit things, she chooses to go with the power score
array option, choosing the powers of Armor, Enhanced Ability (Choosing
Strength), Energy Blast (Electrical Damage), Invulnerability
(Electricity Damage) chooses a sword as her mystical item giving it
Enhanced Attack (Electrical damage). She sees for 5 powers she has an
array of 16,15,14,12,12

So Nani applies her scores ending up with Armor: 16, Enhanced Ability
(Strength): 15, Energy Blast (Electrical):14, Invulnerability
(electricity):12 and Enhanced Attack (Electrical):12  
  
She chooses the *Underpowered Form* flaw requiring her to call upon the
power of her father and the sword he gifted her to take her true form,
giving her a +2 to all her powers, she also *Links* her armor and
enhanced ability powers granting them an additional +2 to those powers,
finally she applies the *Removable Item* flaw to her sword raising her
Enhanced Attack power by +2 as well.

Finalizing her power scores to Armor: 20, Enhanced Ability (Strength):
19, Energy Blast (Electrical):16, Invulnerability (electricity):14 and
her sword now possesses Enhanced Attack (Electrical):16

\</side bar\>

## Determining your Starting Power Scores 

There are three ways to determine your power scores.

**Option 1: Choose a Power Set**

1.  Choose a power set: Power sets are collections of similar powers
    that fall within a particular theme; if you choose a power set, you
    must choose a power set in accordance with your archetype. Once you
    choose your power set, you may rearrange the powers scores as you
    wish among the set’s powers. While power sets limit your choices,

# Weaknesses 

Many heroes possess unique flaws, which in many ways define them as a
hero. Maybe your hero is violently allergic to rare metal, maybe you are
particularly vulnerable to sonic attacks or find all their powers
nullified around strong electrical fields.

You are *not* required to choose a weakness. You may choose to skip this
step.

While some weaknesses are limited to a specific origin, they be applied
to another origin with your Editor-in-Chief’s approval.

When you choose a weakness, you gain a number of points; depending on
the number of points, you may choose from ability score bonuses, power
score bonuses, or bonus feats. You may only acquire a maximum of 20
points through weaknesses; you can always choose more weaknesses at no
mechanical benefit. You may spend these points to gain the following
benefits: you may spend your points on the options below in any way you
wish.

**\<side bar\>**

Editor’s Note:

**The none-weakness:** Both the players and the Editor-in-Chief should
work together to develop a hero’s weakness. The Editor-in-Chief should
be alert for “non-weaknesses,” where players attempt to minimize the
impact of a weakness while gaining maximum benefits.

For example, if you are running a campaign in sunny Miami, a hero with
weakness against extreme cold weather conditions may be attempting to
“game” the system.

**\<side bar\>**

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride along: Weaknesses.*  
Although they don’t have to, both players take on a weakness.

Ruben goes with a physical vulnerability: something about his
telekinetic powers seems to be affected by gravity powers. He chooses a
Stimuli: Gravity Powers and the effect of Power Negation of all his
powers. Gravity Powers are rare, so they are worth 0 points, but power
negation is worth 10 points, and uses it to gain an additional bonus
feat.

Nani decides to give their hero a dependent: her little sister. She is
only 8, so while in good health, she is not quite capable. Nani gains 10
points and uses it to gain +1 to her Enhanced Strength power, raising it
to 20 and +1 to her constitution score raising it to 16.

\</side bar\>

## Addiction 

*You need it. You want it. You gotta have it.*

*There is something out there you desperately crave. During the Glory
Days, it was easy to get enough of it to keep you going. But now, after
Z-Day, supplies are scarce, and getting your fix is becoming harder and
harder. How far will you go before you crash?*

**Effect:** To build an Addiction, select a substance your hero is
addicted to. You may be addicted to more than one substance. If you are,
purchase the substance that gives the highest possible bonus first, then
add a +1 build point for each additional addictive substance. Characters
must partake of their addictive substance at least once per day. If they
fail to partake, they suffer disadvantage on all skill and power checks
until they partake again. While characters are assumed to start playing
with a stockpile of whatever substance they’re addicted to, the
Editor-in-Chief can always declare that this stockpile is depleted,
ruined, or missing; at this point, you will need to seek a new supply.

**Substance:**

- **Common:** Substances could include sugar and/or surgery foods (such
  as candy), cigarettes, or coffee. ***  
  You gain 5 points.***

- **Uncommon:** Substances could include certain mild drugs (such as
  marijuana or commercial painkillers), vaping (electronic cigarettes),
  alcohol, or inhaling certain chemical fumes. ***You gain 10 points.***

- **Rare:** Substances could include hard drugs (cocaine, meth, PCP, and
  the like), commercially available amphetamines, or medical painkiller
  (such as Oxycodone and the like). ***You gain 15 points.***

## Dark Secret

*There is something about you you’d prefer to keep hidden.*

**Effect:** There is something in your past that you’d like to keep
hidden. Having the secret exposed could damage your standing and/or
reputation among their teammates or bystanders, resulting in you longer
being taken seriously, having privileges or supplies taken away, putting
you under suspicion of any recent crimes, or in a worst-case scenario,
they could have you expelled from their current enclave.

- Your secret is something trivial and more potentially embarrassing
  than damaging. For example, maybe you were a boyband pop star,
  participated in a low-brow reality show, was a cringeworthy YouTuber,
  or had a popular We Fan page. ***You gain 5 points.***

- Maybe you made a few deals with supervillains, or you are a former
  criminal (whose crimes go beyond petty theft and the like). Or, they
  may claim experience you don’t have (such as claiming to be a doctor,
  having military experience, or being a police officer). ***You gain 10
  points.***

- You may have resorted to cannibalism to survive the initial aftermath
  of Z-Day, maybe you’re a registered sex offender, or you may have
  committed one or more murders (either before or after Z-Day). Or, they
  may claim to be someone they’re not — a former US Senator, a
  high-ranking member of the Federal government, or they’ve taken the
  identity of a different B-Lister (who may or may not still be alive).
  ***You gain 15 points.***

## Dependence 

*Your metabolism or physiology is such that you require frequent
exposure to a particular condition (such as sunlight or immersion in
water), or you must partake of a specific substance (such as an
experimental medicine), or your equipment might require frequent repair
or refueling.*

**Effect:** To build a Dependency, apply each step and add up the points
acquired. You shouldn’t have more than one Dependency. You must satisfy
their dependence at least once per day; if you fail to do so, they’ll
suffer a negative effect. In addition, the time it takes to satisfy the
dependence can be a factor. Simply popping a pill offers fewer points
than needing to spend hours soaking in a tub of water.

**Substance:**

- **Common:** Substances could include immersion in water, exposure to
  sunlight, or a commonly available alcohol-based fuel. ***You gain 0
  points.***

- **Uncommon:** Substances could include needing to ‘bathe’ in a large
  bonfire, extensive repairs requiring easily scavenged parts, a custom
  fuel that takes time to distill, or an easily synthesized drug. ***You
  gain 5 points.***

- **Rare:** Substances could include extensive repairs requiring
  hard-to-find parts, exposure to a specific form of radiation, or a
  drug custom-made to keep you alive. ***You gain 10 points.***

**Negative Effects:**

- **Power Negation:** All your powers stop working until you can partake
  in your dependency. ***You gain 5 points.***

- **Physical Weakness:** You suffer a disadvantage on Strength,
  Dexterity, Constitution checks and skill checks until you can partake
  in your dependency. ***You gain 5 points.***

- **Incapacitating Weakness:** If you fail to meet your Dependency
  requirement, your maximum Stamina is reduced by 2d12 every hour until
  you reach 0 Stamina and fall unconscious or until you partake in your
  dependency. If you reach 0 stamina, you remain unconscious until you
  partake in your dependency. You recover your lost Stamina after
  completing a long rest. ***You gain 10 points.***

- **Fatal Weakness:** If you fail to meet your Dependence requirement,
  you lose 1 wound every hour until you reach 0 wounds or until you
  partake of your dependency. If you reach 0 wounds you die unless you
  can partake of your dependency within 1 minute after reaching 0
  wounds. You recover wounds lost from suffering this weakness after
  completing a long rest. ***You gain 15 points.***

## Dependent

There is someone you care about who depends on you for survival.

**Effect:** Simply put, there is someone close to you who depends on you
for survival. This goes above and beyond a Supporting Cast member into
something far more personal. Your dependent can be a younger sibling, a
daughter or son, an elderly relative, and so on.

- Your Dependent can be a person of *average* health and ability, they
  are a survivor of the apocalypse and know how to get by. ***You gain 5
  points.***

- Your Dependent is weaker than the *common* survivor. While their mind
  may still be sharp, their body is aged, injured, or ravaged by
  illness. Although they are able to still walk, they do so slowly and
  have difficulty with stairs and the like. ***You gain 10 points.***

- Your Dependent is of *frail* health. They may be blind, deaf,
  partially paralyzed, and so on. They depend on you for most of their
  needs, and would probably quickly succumb to the dangerous of the
  post-apocalyptic world if left alone. ***You gain 15 points.***

### Sample Dependents

There are sample dependents in chapter XXX of this book, alternately you
may choose to build a dependent using the following options.

|             | **Abilities (Points - Array)** | **Skills Points** |
|-------------|:-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Average** | \(25\) 12, 11, 10, 10, 10, 9   | 15                |
| **Weak**    | \(20\) 12, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8      | 10                |
| **Frail**   | \(15\) 12, 10, 9, 8, 8, 8      | 5                 |

**Weak Dependents** possess the Mentally Frail or Physically Frail
weakness (see below).

**Frail Dependents** possess the Mentally Frail or Physically Frail
weakness as well as either a Severe Mental Flaw or Severe Physical Flaw
(see below).

### Dependent Archetypes:

The following examples should give you an idea of the kind of Dependents
your Hero can have.

- **The Younger Sibling:** The younger sibling usually idolizes you and
  wants to be just like you when they grow up. They may wear a variant
  of your costume, practice their combat skills, and cobble together
  sufficient gear in an effort to emulate your super powers. They may
  try to be your sidekick, joining you on excursions, or they may try to
  go out on their own. In any event, odds are that sooner or later they
  will get in over their head, forcing you to try and rescue them.

- **The Child:** The child is similar to the sibling; in that they
  usually look up to you and may also want to be ‘just like you’ when
  they get older. However, the child is often far younger than the
  sibling, and is less capable of taking care of themselves. In
  addition, you need to see to the child’s instruction and training,
  especially in the use of weapons and survival skills. Your enemies may
  see your child as a vulnerability they can exploit, someone they can
  kidnap and use to force you to do their bidding.

- **The Spouse/Lover:** Unlike many who survived the onset of Z-Day, you
  were able to protect your spouse (or lover) from the zombie hordes.
  This may result in you being overly protective of them, and working
  overtime to ensure their safety. They may worry about you as well, and
  may try to talk you into engaging in less risky behavior and try to
  encourage you to remain within the relative safety of the enclave. If
  you’re away too often, your spouse or lover may find solace in the
  company of another, a situation which will probably not end well for
  anyone.

- **The Elderly Relative:** Be it your father, grandmother, or aged
  aunt, you seek to protect and keep safe one of the last remaining
  members of your immediate family. The Elderly Relative is often either
  frail or handicapped and may be bed-ridden or require special medical
  needs. As much as you hate to admit it, they are often a drain on the
  enclave’s resources without giving much back in return. And if you
  ever need to abandon the enclave quickly, their physical health may
  not take the strain.

- **The Mentor/Father Figure:** Unlike the younger sibling who looks up
  to you, this is someone you look up to. This person might be a former
  superhero who taught you the ropes, but whose health has declined with
  old age. Or a replacement for the mother or father you never knew, who
  brought you up when no one else cared. Or your boss from before Z-Day,
  who helped you succeed. In any event, this person’s wisdom and wise
  council is such that you wish to preserve it despite all the
  post-apocalyptic world throws at you.

- **The Beloved Pet:** When you’ve lost everything, then you might seek
  solace in an animal companion. Your dog (or cat, or monkey, or…) may
  be the last thing left from your previous life, or it might be an
  animal you adopted while wandering the apocalyptic wasteland. In any
  event, your pet means as much to you as a child or sibling might mean
  to another Hero. Better keep a close eye on it, lest some other
  survivor gets hungry and decides to eat it.

**What happens if the Dependent dies?  **
Considering the nature of the world post Z-Day, your Hero will need to
consider the possibility of their Dependent’s death. What then? First,
unlike the Glory Days, you have almost no chance of getting a new
Dependent. Or, one with as deep an emotional bond as the one you lost.
To represent the physiological trauma of losing your Dependent in a
post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested world your Hero will need to replace
their Dependent Disadvantage with another weakness fitting the
situation.

- **Enemy:** Mad with grief and anger, you must now seek out whoever (or
  whatever) killed your Dependent to the exclusion of all else. This
  enemy is well aware of your disposition toward them and returns your
  intent in kind.

- **Mental Disorder: Death wish:** You have nothing left to live for.
  You no longer care about your own safety or survival, and will take on
  more and more risky missions and actions, all in an effort to join
  your Dependent in death. You may not even care about others anymore,
  as it is obvious that no matter what you do, everyone around you is
  going to die.

- **Dark Secret:** Maybe it was your direct actions that led to your
  dependent’s death. The knowledge of which would shake your enclave to
  its core.

## Diminished Vitality 

*You have a bit of a glass jaw*

**Effect:** Reduce your maximum stamina by 10, ***You gain 5 points.***

## Enemy

*Someone out there doesn’t like you.*

*Before Z-Day almost every superhero had a rogues’ gallery of foes.
After Z-Day most of these rogues either died, were Z’d, or joined the
assorted B-Listers in defending the rest of humanity. For you, their
place has been taken by someone new. This someone may be an individual
(such as a supervillain with an extreme grudge) or a group (such as a
horde of religious fanatics who wish to burn you and your enclave for
spurning them). In any event, you need to be careful anytime you venture
outside the enclave, as you never know where your enemy may be waiting.*

**Effect:** Your enemy always seems to find a way to complicate your
life and the lives of those around you. The Editor-in-Chief may have
your enemy show up at any time. Even if you take countermeasures to
create some distance between you and your enemy, it is only a matter of
time before they show up again. ***You gain 5 points, with Tyrant being
worth 10.***

\<side bar\>**  **
Editor’s Note:  
**There are always bigger fish:** If the heroes somehow defeat the
hero’s Enemy, it’s not the end of the story, if anything the defeat of
an enemy should open the door to a new threat.

\</side bar\>

### Sample Enemies

The following examples should give you an idea of the kind of Enemies
your Hero can have. Make sure to discuss your idea with the
Editor-in-Chief, first to see if your idea fits the campaign, and second
to see what changes the Editor-in- Chief wants to make to your Enemy
(not all of which you may know about!).

**Biker Gang:** Post Z-Day most biker gangs stay on the move, looting
first one area then another. In this case, you have something the bikers
want. Perhaps there’s a former motorcycle dealership in your enclave,
full of parts they need. Or you have a working fuel refinery and all the
gas the bikers will ever need. Or you have the only decent food stores
for miles around. In any case, the bikers want into your enclave and
will do anything to gain entry. While you might be safe behind your
walls, sooner or later you’ll need to go out into the ruins to scavenge
for supplies and the bikers will be waiting. Worst yet, there may come a
time when the bikers become desperate enough to launch an all-out
assault on your enclave. Will you and your fellow B-Listers be able to
stop them?

**Cannibals:** Similar to the biker gang (and as an added bonus you can
make them a cannibal biker gang), this is a group of people that eats
other people. The exact reasons vary: they may be religious fanatics
(see Cultists below) seeking to emulate zombies by devouring the living;
they may use it as an initiation ritual, forcing others to partake of
human flesh in order to ‘mark’ them; or, they may simply feel that it’s
easier to catch and devour others than bother trying to raise chickens
and pigs. In any case, they wish to devour you and your companions.
Probably because they have a misguided idea that eating the body of a
superhuman will give them superhuman powers, try not to get caught.

**Cultists:** Cultists are religious fanatics whose faith is dark and
twisted. They seek to impose their will, and their religious ways, on
everyone around them. Infidels, which in their case is anyone who
doesn’t believe *exactly* as they do, are to be purged, often with fire.
Cultists may despise zombies, or they may worship them (leading to
cannibal cultists), but in any event, they have no use for your enclave
(aside from the resources it offers). If you do not convert to their
ways by choice, then they will convert you by force. Similar in some
respects to a biker gang, the cultists are less like to lay in wait and
will probably attack openly. Unfortunately, their fanaticism makes them
highly unlikely to break and run.

**Tyrant:** This is an enclave, or series of enclaves, dedicated to one
thing and one thing only, their leader. Everything anyone does, they do
for the ‘state’, and no one is allowed to dissent. Free and independent
enclaves, such as yours, are an anathema to them and must be brought to
heel. The tyrant and their followers are probably the most dangerous
form of Enemy a Hero can have as they are often well-organized,
well-equipped, and well-trained. They are also implacable. Since the
leader can’t appear weak, the tyrant’s followers will almost never give
up the attack and will come at you and your enclave again and again.
They may also use sophisticated tactics, weaponry, and individuals,
including B-Listers of their own. Fortunately for you, these fanatics
are usually led by a single strong man, and if you can take him out,
much of the power goes with him. As the tyrant tends to be paranoid and
power-hungry, they usually haven’t made provisions for when they’re no
longer around. Remove the tyrant, and infighting among the lieutenants
usually takes care of the rest.

*Lucifer’s Hammer* by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle.

\</side bar\>

## Fragile Psyche 

*Your mental state of being is quite fragile.*

**Effect:** You suffer a disadvantage saving throws to resist gaining
levels of psychosis and on horror checks. ***You gain 5 points.***

## Mental Disorder 

You might possess an irrational phobia, a learning disability, or even a
severe mental disorder.

**Effect:** Mental flaws may be any number of things.

- ***Slight:*** You might suffer an irrational fear of something trivial
  like rodents. ***You gain 5 points.***

- ***Challenging:*** You might suffer from a learning disability that
  inhibits your ability to communicate or maintain focus, such as
  Dyslexia or ADHD respectively. ***You gain 10 points.***

- ***Severe:*** You might suffer from a severe mental handicap such as
  Dissociative Identity Disorder, PTSD, or severe Pyromania. ***You gain
  15 points.***

## Mentally Frail

*You’re not the sharpest tool in the shed.*

**Effect:** Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. You suffer
disadvantage on all checks, saving throws, and related skill checks for
that chosen ability. If you choose one ability to be affected, ***you
gain 10 points**,* 2 ability scores for ***15 points**,* and if you
choose all three, ***you gain 20 points.***

## Physical Drawback 

*You possess a physical restriction; maybe you’re missing a few fingers,
an eye, or even a leg.*

**Effect:** Physical flaws may be any number of things, detailed by the
character.

- **Slight**: you may suffer from a few missing fingers, may be hard of
  hearing, or possesses very bad eyesight. Such physical flaws, you
  suffer disadvantage on any applicable action skill rolls. ***You gain
  5 points.***

- **Challenging:** You may suffer from a severe limiting physical flaw,
  such as being deaf or missing an arm, with the co responding results.
  ***You gain 10 points.***

- **Severe:** You may require a wheelchair or are blind (and without
  other special detection powers). ***You gain 15 points.***

## Physically Frail 

*Maybe you are either very young, you may have aged far past your
physical prime, or you’re just not a “prime physical specimen.”*

**Effect:** Choose Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. You suffer
disadvantage on all checks, saving throws, and related skill checks for
that chosen ability. If you choose one ability to be affected, ***you
gain*** ***10 points**,* 2 ability scores for ***15 points**,* and if
you choose all three, ***you gain*** ***20 points**.*

## Physical Vulnerabilities

*You possess a physical vulnerability against a particular material
(such as lead) or condition (such as daylight or being exposed to gamma
radiation).*

*Both heroes and villains will do everything in their power to keep any
vulnerability secret even from their closest friends and companions.*

**Restriction:** cannot be taken by the highly trained or techoheroes.

**Effect:** To build a Unique Vulnerability simply apply each step and
add up total points acquired. You may choose multiple negative effects
to the same stimuli, gaining the highest possible bonus; **+5 points**
for each additional negative effect.

### Stimuli: 

> *Material Weakness:* If a particular type of material is chosen (such
> as lead), Any time you start your turn within 2 areas of that
> substance you suffer from this weaknesses effect. At the
> Editor-in-Chief’s discretion, a huge amount of the material in
> question may increase this weaknesses’ effective range.
>
> *Conditional Weakness:* Any time you are exposed to a particular
> environmental condition; they suffer from their vulnerabilities
> effects until they can get away from or are free of that condition.
>
> *Energy Weakness:* Choose a particular energy type; for example,
> Sonic, Cold, Heat, Gamma Radiation, and so on. You suffer effects of
> this weakness if you are exposed to this energy type consciously for
> more than 1 turn or if you are the target of a power or attack which
> utilizes this energy type.

### Stimuli’s Rarity: 

> *Common items:* Stimuli may include plastic, glass, steel, daylight,
> storms, or being tied up with rope or chains. ***You gain 10

> meteorite from a distant planet or being exposed to the radiation of a
> distant sun. ***You gain 0 points.***

### Negative Effects: 

> *Power Negation:* All of your inborn powers simply stop working until
> the end of your next turn if you start your turn within range of your

## Ravenous Metabolism 

*Your body requires much more food than a regular person.*

**Restriction:** Super-Human, Cosmic, or Supernatural, or Alien or
Andromorph Archetype

**Effect:** During the Glory Days food was never really a problem for
you; with drive through, vending machines, and the local supermarket,
you were never more than an arm’s reach away from a power bar. But
things have changed. You require double the food of a regular person,
and must eat something every 6 hours in between regular meals, be it
beef jerky, Twinkies, an apple, or what have you. Although you can
attempt to keep yourself well-supplied with food stores, there will come
times when the Editor-in-Chief simply informs you food supplies are
running low, which may force you to undertake a scavenger run, seek out
fruit trees, and so on. If you do not eat on regular bases (every 6
hours) your Burnout Threshold decreases by 5 for every meal you skip, to
a minimum of 5. ***You gain 5 points.***

## Strange Appearance

*You possess a strange or disturbing appearance which may entice or
terrify others.*

**Effect:** To build a Strange Appearance, choose its ease of
concealment and your appearance’s effect on others then add up the
points acquired. Bystanders or other heroes who do not know you on a
personal basis may be quick to judge, flee from you, or in the case of
someone with a threatening appearance, may attack you. Additionally, you
suffer a penalty to all Influence skill rolls equal to the amount of
points acquired through this disadvantage.

*Ease of Concealment:* If your strange appearance is easily concealed,
***you gain 0 points*.** If your strange appearance is impossible to
hide (such as fur or a demonic appearance), ***you gain 5 points.***

*Effect upon others:* If you possess a slightly disturbing or strangely
attractive trait (such as red eyes or shining silver hair) ***you gain 0
points***. If your appearance is disturbing or mildly threatening (small
horns or giant bat wings) ***you gain 5 points*.** If your appearance is
outright threatening (you possess the aforementioned demonic
appearance), ***you gain 10 points.***

## Taboo

*You are restricted from actions a normal person can perform.*

**Effect:** The nature of your existence means there are certain things
you simply cannot do. Perhaps your mystical powers require you to
refrain from eating meat or bathing. Perhaps your android programming
includes a failsafe against certain behavior. Perhaps your supernatural
nature prevents you from entering a building without being invited. To
build a Taboo apply each step and add up the points acquired. The Hero
may choose multiple Taboos, gaining the highest possible bonus, **+5
points** for each additional restriction.

### Restriction

- *Easy:* These restrictions either have few negative effects when
  followed or are rarely encountered. Examples include not interacting
  with a particular person, not bathing except in a natural lake or
  river, or not crossing a line of salt. ***You gain 0 points.***

- *Moderate:* These restrictions make life difficult or are frequently
  encountered. Restrictions could include not touching bare human skin,
  not remaining in the presence of a symbol of faith, or not attacking
  without offering a chance to surrender. ***You gain 5 points.***

- *Difficult:* These restrictions negatively impact your life daily.
  Restrictions could include not eating food that you have not killed
  and prepared yourself, not touching metal, or not harming a living
  being. ***You gain 10 points.***

### Negative Effects

- Power Negation: All of the affected powers simply stop working when
  the Taboo is broken, until you Atone. ***You gain 5 points per power
  affected.***

- Physical Weakness: All of your ability scores are reduced by 2 until
  you Atone. ***You gain 5 points.***

- Impossibility: It is simply impossible for you to break this Taboo.
  You are physically incapable of doing so. If you are somehow forced to
  do so, you must dedicate you efforts into no longer breaking the Taboo
  in the most efficient manner possible. Since you cannot willingly
  break this Taboo, there is no atonement option. ***You gain 10
  points.***

- Incapacitating Weakness: After initial violation of the Taboo you lose
  1d8 stamina that bypasses all Damage resistance at the end of every
  turn until they atone or fall unconscious. They remain so until they
  Atone, which might be difficult if they are unconscious. ***You gain
  10 points.***

- Fatal Weakness: After breaking the Taboo, you begin to lose 1 wound
  every minute you reach 0 wounds, at which point you die. This process
  ends if you atone, but unless the Atonement is simple it is very
  unlikely to happen before death. ***You gain 15 points.***

### Atonement

- Simple Atonement: Atonement for breaking this Taboo is simple to
  perform and requires no special materials. It might involve spending
  an hour in prayer, or running a system reset. Even a simple atonement
  should take at least a scene to perform. ***You gain 0 points.***

- Difficult Atonement: Atonement for breaking this Taboo is difficult to
  perform, requiring at least a day, and perhaps special materials not
  easily available after Z-Day. It might involve burning incense or
  finding electronic equipment to replace fused wiring. ***You gain 5
  points.***

- Atonement Quest: Atonement for breaking this Taboo involves a heroic
  quest that should be the subject of its own Issue, or perhaps even
  Mini-Series. It might involve tracking down an android’s original
  programmer, a ghost returning to the distant place of their death to
  reconnect with their old life or passing a series of spiritual trials
  to reconnect with mystic power. ***You gain 10 points.***

# Starting Gear 

You start play with a go-bag and a few other items, for a list of gear
on see pg XX.

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride along: Starting Gear*

Ruban and Nani now get to choose their starting gear,

Ruban chooses a medium auto-pistol and combat knife has his weapons and
a Survivalist Go-Bag

Nani chooses a heavy revolver and a hand axe as her weapons and a
Survivalist Go-Bag as well, because she is trained in urban survival and
outdoorsmen, she gains an additional 6 AP to spend and chooses to pick
up Batteryless “shake” Flashlight, Solar/Crank radio, Multi-Tool, and
Maps.

\</side bar\>

All Heroes begin play with the following: see gear page XX

- A single firearm or archaic ranged weapon.

- A single melee weapon.

- A single go-bag.

- Additional Items: You start play with 3 Acquisition Points (AP) if you
  are trained either *Scavenge* or *Urban Survival*. If you are trained
  in both or expertly trained in either skill you gain 6 (AP) instead.
  You may use these points to acquire additional weapons and equipment.
  You may not use AP’s to acquire a working vehicle.

# Attributes & Defenses

### Rank Bonus

This bonus is equal to your hero’s rank, you start with +1 rank bonus.

### Grit 

As first mentioned on pg XX, Your Grit bonus is added to saving throws.
Your Grit is equal to your Rank which can be further adjusted by your
Origin or feats you may have purchased during hero creation.

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride along: Defenses and Attributes*  
Now our players are in the home stretch and need to do the final
mechanical touches to their heroes.

First Ruban and Nani have a +1 rank bonus.

Now to Defenses, Ruban looks at his finalized ability scores and chooses
his intelligence for his Avoidance, Constitution for his Fortitude
defense, and his charisma for his willpower defense giving him starting
defenses of Avoidance: 14, Fortitude: 13 and Willpower :15

Nani does the same choosing her Dexterity for her Avoidance, Strength
for her Fortitude and Wisdom for her Willpower defense giving her final
defenses of Avoidance: 12, Fortitude: 15 and Willpower: 13 her final
Fortitude is 17 thanks to her toughness feat.

Stamina being the sub of all of one’s defenses are 42 for Ruban and 51
(41 +10 from toughness feat) for Nani. And they both start with 3
wounds.

Pace & Initiative both rely upon their dexterity giving Ruban a pace of
1 and +0 to initiative and Nani a pace of 2 and a +2 to initiative.

Burnout Threshold Ruban and Nani both choose her Constitution for her
Burnout Threshold giving her 14, 15 respectively.

\</side bar\>

### Defenses 

Reflect your ability to avoid or resist attacks of all kinds and are
affected by one of two ability scores, in Rotted capes all attacks are
preformed against one of these defenses.

**Avoidance**

Avoidance is your ability to read incoming attacks and dodge them. It
combines elements of your athleticism and logic. Whenever an attack
seeks to physically strike you, the attack targets your Avoidance
Defense. Avoidance is adversely modified by armor and benefits from
shields.

Avoidance = 10 + Dexterity Modifier or your Intelligence Modifier + Rank
(+1)

**Fortitude**

Fortitude is the Hero’s ability to withstand severe trauma, poisons, and
diseases. It combines elements of your health and conditioning. Whenever
an attack would inflict trauma on your health and physical well-being,
the attack targets your Fortitude Defense.

Fortitude = 10 + Strength Modifier or your Constitution Modifier+ Rank
(+1)

**Willpower**

Willpower is your ability to overcome hardship, resist attacks on the
mind, and remain focused in the face of distraction. It combines
elements of your force of personality and insight. Whenever an attack
seeks to deceive or dominate you, the attack targets the Hero’s
Willpower Defense

Willpower = 10 + Charisma Modifier or your Wisdom Modifier+ Rank (+1)

\<Side Bar\>  
**Difference between defenses and saving throws:**

Defenses are your first line of defense against many effects, while
saving throws are commonly used to represent you shaking off or
otherwise ending an ongoing effect.

\</Side Bar\>

### Health 

Your health, stamina and wounds reflect your ability to endure physical
harm and suffering.

**Stamina**

Stamina represents you’re staying power during combat; it is not your
physical toughness, but instead represents your endurance under duress.

When determining your stamina, you only apply your base defenses with no
conditional modifiers. (such as those provided by powers or feats). When
your Defenses advance (see Advancement, page xx), your Stamina increases
accordingly.

Stamina = Avoidance Defense + Fortitude Defense + Willpower Defense

**Wounds**

Wounds represent your Hero’s ability to absorb raw, physical trauma.

Wounds = heroes possess 3 wounds or half your constitution modifier
whichever is greater.

### Pace 

Pace represents how fast you can run. You can move a maximum number of
areas in a round equal to their Dexterity Modifier (minimum of 1 and a
maximum of 5). This may be further increased through Powers or feats.

### Initiative 

You have an Initiative Bonus, which is equal to your Dexterity Modifier,
which may be increased through Powers or feats.

Initiative = Dexterity Modifier

### Burnout Threshold 

Some powers cause stress and fatigue on a Hero, occasionally reaching a
point where the Hero’s powers simply stop working for a time. This may
leave them vulnerable to zombie infection or being served as dinner.

To determine your Burnout Threshold, choose either your Willpower or
Fortitude defense. Once this defense is chosen, it cannot be changed,
ever.

# The Finishing Touches 

## Personality Flaws 

*I remember the Hood telling me once that there’s always something that
separates us from the bystanders, a darkness that keeps us from ever
being like them. She called it “compensation” for our empowerment.
Sometimes it’s attached to our powers, but more often it’s attached to
our hearts. It’s a weakness that others like us can exploit.*

*I never really understood what she meant until Z-Day hit. Fighting to
survive certainly turned up the pressure and for every ‘superhero’ I saw
rise from the ashes, I saw that darkness as well. Sometimes it brought
out the best in heroes; I’ve seen superheroes that could’ve easily
escaped stand in the way of a zombie horde just to buy some time for
fleeing bystanders. Sometimes it brings out the worst; I’ve seen
superheroes rationalize throwing one or two weaker bystanders into the
clutches of the zombies just to buy time to escape.*

*This darkness, this flaw, is different for each of us, but it’s
undeniably a part of all of us. I can’t explain why, but then again I
can’t explain shooting jets of flame from fingertips or super strength
either. Sometimes, it just is.*

\<side bar\>  
*Character creation ride along: The Finishing Touches*  
First off both players pick their personality flaws.

Ruben picks Darwinist and Young Gun with his tagline being “ha, you
thought you had me.”

Nani picks Impatient and Overconfident with her tagline being “Taste the
lighting.”

\</side bar\>

### Personality flaws In Play 

Personality flaws are one of the mechanisms which allow you to acquire
plot points, at any time you, the editor-in-chief, or a fellow player
can activate one of your personality flaws, if you accept the
consequences with grace you gain a plot point, for more information on
plot points see page XX

### Choosing a personality flaw 

Every player must choose at least one personality flaw. These flaws are
the iconic double-edged sword; they can benefit your hero just as much
as they can hinder. This is in addition to any flaws you may have gained
though your Origin.

### Always a Sidekick 

*Look, whatever you guys want to do is fine by me. I wish Shooting Star
was still here; he always pointed me in the right direction.*

You were a sidekick in the Glory Days and you still haven’t come to
grips with the fact that you’re a top dog. You always look to others to
fill the “hero” role, and you’re happy to work alongside them – or maybe
just a step or two behind them.

### Berserker

*You crave battle and the madness it brings.*

Once you start fighting you don’t stop. Tactical plans, your orders, the
objective, it all goes out the window once combat commences. Unlike
Bloodthirsty, you don’t look for excuses to start fights, but once they
start you keep going until no one is left standing… and that might mean
friends as well as foes.

### Bloodthirsty 

*Cool it, man! He stole the can of tuna because he was hungry; you don’t
have to beat him to a bloody pulp over it.*

You have a brutal temper that borders on sadism. You enjoy beating
enemies to a bloody pulp and often look for the flimsiest excuse to
consider someone an enemy.

### Chilling Presence

*Hey, don’t creep up on me like that! You know, I always thought it was
just the costume, but you’ve got that moody,*

*scary thing going on even when you aren’t wearing one.*

Whether it’s the way you look, the way you sound when you talk, the way
you carry yourself, or a bit of all three, you unnerve people. They
don’t want to be close to you and, at times, wouldn’t mind if the
zombies got you.

### Clumsy

*I know that you’re twice the width of the average Joe, but that still
doesn’t excuse you from knocking things down in front of me when we’re
trying to keep one step ahead of the zombies!*

You are clumsy by nature and tend to bump or fumble things at the wrong
time. You also tend to drop or break things (especially if they’re
fragile), and can easily find the one chunk of loose pavement to trip
over, no matter how carefully you step.

### Combat Paralysis

*You tend to freeze up in stressful situations.*

When the going gets tough, you tend to not go anywhere. In times of
stress (such as combat and the like), you ‘lock up,’ neither moving nor
reacting for a few actions. You better hope you have friends, or you’re
not going to live much longer.

### Craven 

*Forget B-Lister, you act more like a Super-Villain’s cowardly minion –
or comic relief. You jump at shadows, shriek at the slightest threat of
violence, and are quite afraid of… well, absolutely everything.*

During the Glory Days you were a Hero’s expert or Villain’s minion; you
were never called upon to fight and you actually can’t stand violence.
You firmly believe that discretion is the better part of valor and avoid
conflict whenever possible.

### Darwinist 

*Sometimes you need to sacrifice one to save many.*

You won’t go out of your way to save a Bystander when the odds don’t
favor it and you aren’t adverse to allowing slow or wounded Bystanders
“take one for the team” and save the rest. While you may be able to
convince Bystanders and other Heroes of the necessity of your actions,
they often find it difficult to live with once you’re past the immediate
danger.

### Greedy 

*You know that little girl needs your antibiotics, but you may need them
some day! You found them, and they are yours, damn it!*

You are very possessive of items you salvage; you have a stock pile of
stuff and will go out of your way to get more, risking life and limb in
the process. You are also fully capable of hiding things you find from
your fellow survivors.

### Gremlins

*You and technology have never been the best of friends.*

To say you have trouble using any electronic devices made after 1975 is
an understatement. Whenever you’re around, computers tend to crash,
cellphones build static and drop calls, sensitive scanners go haywire,
newer cars stall out at the worst moments (or simply refuse to start in
the first place), and so on.

### Haunted by Nightmares 

*You see the zombies in your sleep.*

You have trouble sleeping through the night without zombies infecting
your dreams. At times it’s so bad that they appear in your daydreams as
well.

### The Hero’s Code 

*Look, I get it. You want to fight for freedom, justice, and mom’s apple
pie. But take a look around; it’s all gone, flushed down a zombie
toilet. Why can’t you see that?*

Whether you actually believe in it or are just using it to hold on to
your sanity, you continue to follow the unwritten code of superheroes to
an extreme. You do not lie, cheat, or steal, even to survive. You treat
super zombies as honorably would any other supervillain or henchman.

### Hero Worship 

*If Lady Liberty were here, she’d try to save those Bystanders. If I
want to prove myself worthy of carrying on her mantle, I’ll need to try
to save them as well.*

You idolize a particular hero or villain. You try to live by their code
and remind others about their deeds. You may even model your own super
identity on that hero or villain. Note that the subject of your worship
need not be dead or Z’d and your subject may not be too happy to have
you using her handle.

### Impatient 

*You have no capacity for repetitive tasks or waiting around and have a
short attention span.*

You can’t stand sitting around and making plans; the zombies are
everywhere and they’re closing in all the time! You want to act, now!
Unfortunately, your impatience often leads you into danger with no
preparation.

### Lone Wolf 

*Look, we voted and I’m the leader, remember? I want us to survive just
as much as you do. Why do you keep second-guessing me and undermining my
authority?*

While you understand the concept of safety in numbers, you just don’t
work well with a group. Someone is always holding you back or supporting
a clearly inferior course of action. You’d just rather be on your own,
taking support only when you need it.

### Lying Eyes 

*Your tongue may be clever, but your eyes betray you.*

No one trusts you. Maybe it’s the way you carry yourself, maybe it’s
because you make unconvincing arguments, or maybe it’s because you
really don’t care. In any case, you have a difficult time convincing
people of what you say.

### Megalomania 

*I’ve been telling you for years that only through an iron fist does
civilization stand a chance! Look at the world now! Once I establish
order we’ll wipe away the zombies once and for all!*

You were a power-mad super villain (albeit a low-powered one) during the
Glory Days and Z-Day changed nothing. While you protect Bystanders and
work with Heroes, you do so out of a desire to establish a new world
order, with you at the top.

### Nihilistic 

*Even if we do destroy all the zombies, then what? Look around you,
guys, this world is over. We’ve got nothing to look forward to but ruins
and memories.*

You’ve given up hope. You survive because you must, if only to help
others, but you just don’t see a glimmer of a bright future anywhere on
the horizon. When things seem hopeless you’re strangely content, and
it’s difficult to get you to fight against the odds.

### Oblivious 

*Hey guys, why are you all sneaking up the stairs with your guns drawn?*

You are oblivious most of the time; maybe you suffer from extreme ADHD
or have simply drawn into yourself. Regardless of the cause, there are
times you ignore or fail to notice what is right in front of you.

### Overconfident

*There’s nothing you can’t overcome.*

While others believe that discretion is the better part of valor, you
rush in where angels fear to tread. You have complete confidence in your
abilities as well as those of your companions, which sometimes leads to
taking on more than you can chew.

### Over Protective 

*What do you mean, “If we send out a group maybe some of them will come
back?” We can’t treat Bystanders like cattle! I’ve been protecting this
enclave since Z-Day. They’re my children!*

You are extremely over-protective of the Bystanders in your enclave and
treat each of them as you would your children (and you dote on your
children). This makes the hard choices even more difficult for you, and
you take the loss of any Bystander extremely hard.

### Patriot 

*Sure things look tough, but we’re Americans! Our nation was born in
troubled times and we’ve weathered worse! We’ll get through this so long
as we never forget our ideals!*

You strongly believe in something, usually the nation of your birth, and
you optimistically hold on to its ideals, laws, and principles. Your
patriotism is often at odds with reality, and many fellow Heroes and
Bystanders aren’t appreciative of your love for the Golden Age.

### Poor Substitute 

*What do you mean, ‘I’m too young to be the Night Ranger’? I kept the
city safe from Mega Master countless times! Of course I don’t have all
the trick arrows anymore; I lost them years ago!*

You have not only taken on the mantle of an old superhero, you’re
starting to believe that you are that superhero. Unfortunately, this
goes far beyond roleplaying; at times you believe that you have access
to powers that you simply don’t have, which can be dangerous when the
zombie horde is surrounding you.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 

*You have seen the dark face of the apocalypse; it’s changed you, and
you’re on the edge of losing it, all the time.*

Not only brought on through combat build, PTSD can be brought on by any
violent traumatic build, like a zombie apocalypse. You are always on
edge; you jump at loud noises and fly off the handle sometimes despite
yourself. It’s hard for you to sleep, but when you do, you sleep with a
knife at your side and a gun under your pillow.

### Revolutionary 

*You disagree with how your enclave is governed and you make no attempt
to hide your disapproval.*

You are constantly at odds with the leadership of your enclave and
actively support replacing it with another type of government.
Unfortunately, you usually hold the minority opinion and most Bystanders
worry that your position may one day threaten the enclave.

### Ruthless 

*You are a reformed Super-Villain or amoral hero and you try to do the
right thing, but you still lack compassion for others.*

You have no appreciation for the feelings of others and fake compassion
as best you can. You know that what you’re doing now is right, but you
might as well be a robot as far as your feelings are concerned. You
often look to other heroes to see how you should be feeling.

### Survivor’s Guilt 

*Many Bystanders in your enclave have fearfully left a friend or loved
one to the clutches of zombies but they never expected it from a hero.
You let someone die in a moment of weakness and no matter how much you
try to make up for it, Bystanders never let you forget it.*

You just can’t put your moment of weakness behind you. Not only is it
brought up every time you offer an opinion on a course of action, but
the friends and loved ones of the person you deserted occasionally try
to exact revenge.

### Too Much of a Good Thing

*There is attractive, and then there’s you.*

You look good, even in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. It might be
due to your super-human powers, a lucky roll of the genetic dice, or all
of the work you had done before Z-Day.

Unfortunately, people equate your looks with your intelligence and
general level of skill, figuring your IQ equals your shoe size. Either
that, or you must deal with a string of unwanted suitors or people
trying to protect you from harm, lest your good looks become tarnished.

### Unlucky 

*Lady Luck wants to see you get eaten by zombies.*

You can’t put your finger on it, but you just have the worst luck. Two
paths? The one you take is filled with zombies. Have a weakness? Count
on it to be incorporated into the next super zombie’s costume.

### Unattractive 

*You never did look good in spandex due to that pot belly. The
prescription eyeglasses don’t help either.*

For whatever reason, people that would normally be attracted to you find
you homely at best and quite possibly repulsive.

### Villainous Past 

*Yes, you keep saying that the Z-Day changed everything, but you know
what? I don’t care. Before the Z-Day you were an arrogant,
megalomaniacal, narcissistic SOB with blood on your gloves. I still
don’t trust you.*

You were a rather public and sinister supervillain before the Z-Day and
you can’t shake your reputation. You are treated poorly, constantly
watched, and always the first suspect whenever something bad happens
that doesn’t involve zombies.

### Young Gun 

*You are so young it’s hard for others to take you seriously, as a
result you constantly compensate in a desperate bid to gain respect.*

When others are watching, you are exceedingly reckless, all in an
attempt to gain some level of respect. You always volunteer for
dangerous missions and leap headlong into “heroic” situations.

### Xenophobia 

*You really don’t like strangers*.

You are immediately suspicious and intolerant toward anyone that isn’t
part of your survivalist enclave. It takes a long time for a stranger to
gain your trust.

### Zealot 

*We brought this on ourselves. Only if we truly repent and ask for
forgiveness will this nightmare be over.*

Whether you were a person of faith before or found religion in the
aftermath of Z-Day, you now strongly hold on to its teachings. Your
faith may not be exactly what that faith taught in the Glory Days
(you’ve had to interpret a lot on your own) and some of your
interpretations may be quite fanciful, but you firmly believe in it. You
want – need – everyone else to join you.

## Taglines

*There was another thing we all had in common; each and every one of us
had a tagline. Yes, I realize it was kind of silly, and most heroes’
taglines seemed almost forced. But it was one of those unwritten
traditions we all followed.*

*Back in the day, the media would do most of the work for us; I still
remember how they stuck Armory with “Stand Back” after they caught him
saying it on the news two times… never mind the fact that he was telling
bystanders and members of his own team to basically get out of the way.
But before you knew it, there he was yelling “Stand Back” right before
he would let loose with some new weapon or right before he would land
the telling blow.*

*We all have taglines, and the bystanders eat it up; it seems to give
them some hope. At least some of us have hope left.*

### Taglines in play 

Once per scene, you may utter the tagline as you perform any action.
Depending on how well you use the tagline in the moment you may get
rewarded with a plot point which you may them immediately use. Make the
use of a tagline dramatic! That’s what they are for.

**Example:** Velocity flashes by a super zombie, coming out of nowhere
catching it and his fellow heroes by surprise.

Looking up at the Editor-in-Chief he says “Ha! You never saw that
coming”, activating his tagline and getting a free Plot Point reroll.

### Choosing a Tagline 

Players should choose a tagline during character creation, or they can
start play without one and allow the other players, and bystanders (aka
the Editor-in-Chief) to choose one for them.

A tagline should be quick sentence or saying, a call to battle, or a
quip commonly used by the Hero.

Here are some examples

“You never saw that coming” – Velocity

“Turn it up!” – Sonic Boom

“I am the night!” – The Hood

“Protectors, take them down!” – Sentinel

# The Cast

*I’m telling you I have seen some amazing things since Z-Day. Through
all the blood and death, I have seen ruthless men become selfless
heroes.*

*I don’t know, maybe it’s a defense mechanism, a primal need to gather,
form family, and protect our fellow man. There are so few of us that
maybe our inner caveman needs us to form tribes and look upon our each
other as brother and sister, instead of competitors or prey.*

*Zombie survival stories are never truly about the zombies, but the
survivors. These stories bring together radically different people and
force them to come together, and grow closer.*

In this last step, we create those personal bonds between your heroes
and the survivors under your care. Every zombie story has its supporting
cast, and it’s those stories between your characters and those they care
about make *things truly matter*.

Unlike character creation, creating the supporting cast is more of a
group event, and should be done during a session 0, with all the players
together at the table, online, or over a group chat.

Once everyone is together, have each player describe one or two members
of the supporting cast, these are common bystanders they have formed
personal connections with. Maybe you saved someone from becoming zombie
chow. Or maybe they are family members, or old friends, or maybe a
random survivor that reminds you of someone in your past.

Once a bystander is created, the other players may propose one or more
personality flaws, such as being an alcoholic, a thrill seeker, or
possessing a dark secret. If multiple players propose different flaws,
the Editor-in-Chief chooses the ones they like and grants that player a
Plot Point.

Proposing flaws should be done *in secret*, have the players write their
ideas down on a paper or text the editor-in-chief their proposed flaw.
Then depending on the nature of the flaw the Editor-in-Chief may decide
to have the supporting character’s personality flaw be public knowledge.

Also during this process, if you opted to take either the *supporting
character* or *sidekick* feat you may apply it to one of the bystanders
you created. Upgrading the character from a bystander to a supporting
character. Stating out bystanders is left to the Editor-in-Chief,
Supporting Characters can either be stated out by the Editor-in-Chief or
if they allow, by you.

During gameplay, cast members are usually controlled by the
Editor-in-Chief, but this may not always be the case.

A good way to keep everyone involved in the game or tell multiple
stories (for example, when the party is split up, or when there are
events taking place back at the enclave), there are times that the
Editor may hand a Cast member to another player to role-play.

By no means are these the only survivors. Depending upon the size of
your enclave, you may have many more Bystanders. But the Cast is more
than that; they are the survivors the Heroes have formed personal
connections with.

**Building the Cast:** See chapter “XX” the cast for details on stating
out the cast.
