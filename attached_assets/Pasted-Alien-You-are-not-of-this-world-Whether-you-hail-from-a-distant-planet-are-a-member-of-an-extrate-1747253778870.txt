Alien
You are not of this world. Whether you hail from a distant planet, are a member of an extraterrestrial race, or from another dimension, your origins lie beyond. Your alien nature grants you unique abilities and perspectives that set you apart from humanity. 
Perhaps you arrived on Earth as an ambassador of your people, or maybe you were stranded here, your spacecraft damaged beyond repair, forcing you to adapt to survive. Regardless of the circumstances, you are now a stranger in a strange land, facing the dual challenges of the zombie apocalypse and the mysteries of this new world.
Your alien heritage brings both advantages and challenges. You may possess advanced technology, telepathic abilities, or physical attributes beyond human limits. However, you also grapple with the struggle of finding your place among humans, building trust, and understanding their customs and culture.

Ability Score Bonus: 
As an Alien, your unique physiology grants you enhanced physical attributes. You gain a +2 bonus to your Strength score.

Unique Advantages: 
Alien Resilience: Your alien physiology grants you natural resistance to physical harm. You have an innate Damage Resistance (DR) of 1 against all physical damage, which stacks with any other sources of DR. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against poisons.
Advanced Technology: Your knowledge and access to advanced alien technology provide you with unique tools and gadgets. Any powers that apply the removable item power modification have their power scores increased by +1.
Unique Disadvantages: 
Cultural Misunderstanding: Your alien nature and cultural background may lead to misunderstandings and difficulties in interacting with humans. You have a disadvantage on Insight checks when trying to understand human behavior and social cues. Additionally, specific actions or customs that are commonplace for your alien race may be seen as strange or alarming to humans, potentially leading to tension or hostility.
Lost Connection: Being trapped on Earth during the zombie apocalypse has severed your ties to your alien home world. You no longer have access to the resources and support from your alien civilization. Any attempt to contact or seek assistance from your home world is uncertain at best.
Origin Features: As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

Android
You are some form of mechanical creation, be it a self-aware robot, an artificially-constructed human, or even a human brain in a cybernetic body. You have an inorganic makeup and are relatively immune to most diseases. Making you a very valuable member of any enclave. However, that said…. 
<side bar>
Editor’s Note: 
Being immune to infection may make the Android too effective for the zombie apocalypse. You may want to consider the possibility of a machine-based virus allowing for mechanical zombies. See “Zombies and Non-Humans,” p. XX, for more options. 
</side bar>
Ability Score Bonus: 
Androids are a varied lot, but their digital minds allow them to recall information with ease. You gain +2 to your Intelligence score.

Unique Disadvantages: 
Lack of Emotion: you suffer a -5 penalty on all insight rolls to read another’s emotional state.

Cosmic
You can tap into and channel the energies that permeate the universe. How you gained these powers is up to you, but you might possess an alien artifact that draws upon such energies or may someone have granted you these powers to help keep law and order in this small section of the universe. However, despite your origin, you’re still a B-Lister and only possess a fraction of the power cosmically enhanced A-Listers can sling around. In other words, no flying through space unaided, defending entire solar systems all by yourself, or destroying starships with a single energy blast. And worse yet, you’re now trapped in a world overrun by the living dead. Your starship may be damaged, your interstellar flight ring has gone missing, or with your mentor gone, you have sworn to eradicate the zombie threat in their memory.
The reason doesn’t matter. What does matter is that you’re in for the long haul and are here to stay.
Ability Bonus: 
Comic beings come in many shapes, but the rigors of being a vessel for such power demand a level of durability. You gain +1 to your Constitution and one other ability score of your choice.
Unique Advantages:
Limitless Cosmic Power: The energies that permeate the universe are nigh inexhaustible. You receive the Increased Burnout Power Feat. Additionally, all your inborn powers are Cosmic in nature. 

Unique Disadvantages:
Power Limits: While you have access to unending cosmic energy, you don’t have an unending suite of powers to call upon. You can only gain new inborn powers through mastering emulated powers based on your existing inborn powers. 
Later, with Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may acquire new powers, but none of them can be Inborn powers; they must be made available through technology, supernatural, or some other external source. Certain story-based events, such as exposure to a nuclear reactor, massive amounts of solar radiation, or other such esoteric energies, may allow you to acquire new inborn powers.

If you already have the Energy Manipulation (Cosmic) power, increase your power score in that power by +4 if the score is higher than your Charisma score.
Demigod
You are a ‘divine’ being. Or at least you claim to be. It is possible you’re the result of the union between a god and a mortal, or you may be the avatar of such a being, sent to Earth to work its will. Before Z-Day, other superheroes figured you were either a powerful alien, a deluded mutant, another form of superhuman, a visitor from another dimension, or a walking example of ‘any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.’ After Z-Day, all that mattered was that you were alive and could deal with the zombie threat.

Ability Bonus: 
Demigods are as different as the deities of the varied pantheons as such, you get a +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice or +1 to any two ability scores of your choice.

Later, with Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may acquire new powers, but none of them can be Inborn powers; they must be made available through technology, supernatural, or some other external source. Of course, certain story-based events tied to your Demigod’s mythological theme may allow you to gain new inborn powers.

Highly Trained 
Yes, it was hard for you to make a name for yourself; you can’t fly, dodge bullets, or build a battle suit that would have allowed you to face down the likes of the Raptor or Inferno, but what you lacked in raw power you more than made up for in hard earned skill. 
At one time, you may have been a highly trained field agent for the NSA or The Division, or maybe you were a uniquely gifted martial artist trained in almost forgotten techniques by a solitary master, or perhaps you were a rich millionaire utilizing almost limitless resources, ruthless training, and an unbreakable will to forge yourself into more than an ordinary man. 
Regardless of how you trained your body to become the hero you are today, you face a threat you could have never foreseen. And you thought you had it hard when your enemies were breathing… 
Ability Bonus: Skill-based heroes are a varied lot; they gain a +1 bonus to any three attributes of their choice. 
Unique Advantages: 
My knowledge is my power: You gain 10 additional points to buy skills or feats. Also, unlike other Heroes, you may purchase up to three skill sets. You also gain a bonus Feat (see Feats pg. XX) of your choice except for Visionary. 
Unique Disadvantages: 
Only Human: You are ultimately only human; you may never increase your physical attributes (before applying powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.
No Powers: You do not possess any inborn powers; therefore, any power must be skill-based or the result of specialized equipment. Powers marked with a (*) in Archetypes and later in the Powers section may be attributed to specialized training. If you choose these as powers, they must possess the All Skill Power Modification. Any other powers are the product of custom technology; thus, they must have the External Power Source and the Cybernetic Implants or Removable Item Power Modifications.
New Power Limitations: You may only learn new powers as skill-based powers; alternately, with the Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may acquire new powers through special equipment, implants, or from some event. 
Origin Features: As you advance in level (see Hero Advancement pg. xx), at specific levels, you will be granted Origin Features; when you do, choose one of the options from the list below. You may only choose A-Lister Rank Origin Features once you reach gamma level 1.

Mystic
You are one of the rarest heroes, a mystic arts practitioner, or a mystic power wielder. You Might be a magician calling ancient powers and bending them to your will, or an ancient artifact may have chosen you to wield its power for a greater purpose, or a master of mystical gadgetry.
Before Z-Day, you may have used your knowledge to fight crime under the guise of a stage magician, acted as a private investigator of the occult, or defended the Earth from extradimensional invaders. You may have even taken to wearing a colorful costume and fighting alongside more traditional (at least in the public mind) heroes. In any event, you were considered an oddity, even among the other heroes. Scientists may try and quantify your power source, while others would dismiss your clams as theater to invoke your heroic persona. But after Z-Day, does it matter anymore? Depending on the cause of the Zombie Apocalypse chosen by the Editor, you may be one of the people best equipped to deal with the apocalypse. Zombies (and other forms are undead) are often par for the course for many mystic masters.
The problem here, however, is that there are so many zombies. More unsettling is the silence that has settled onto the supernatural side of the world. You would have thought the deaths of so many would have caused an increase in apparitions and ghosts of the world. Instead, there is an uneasy quiet. In addition, you can now “feel” the waves of mystic power far more quickly than before as it flows readily through you. It is so accessible that you’d think it was building itself up in anticipation, but for what? 
<side Bar>
Superheroic Sorcery
At first glance, superheroes and sorcery may seem like an odd mix, but magic-using and magic-powered superheroes date back to the first costumed crime fighters. Thus, when playing Rotted Capes, you and the Editor-in-Chief must consider the nature of magic and magical characters in your campaign.
For starters, superheroic magicians tend to look and dress differently than your typical costumed crime fighter. Skin-tight costumes tend to be reasonably rare, replaced with trench coats, tunics, top hats, capes and cloaks, and so on. And even if they wear a skin-tight costume, the superheroic sorcerer tends to have or use some distinctive artifact that marks them as a magician, such as an enchanted helmet, a “spell sword,” or a power-channeling staff. Finally, such heroes also have codenames that reflect the nature of their powers. For example, there are a lot of Doctors slinging spells in the comics.
Next, we need to consider the nature of superheroic spellcasting. Much of it tends to be akin to thaumaturgy or “wonder-working.” In other words, comic book magicians work miracles through their spells and spellcraft. However, very few comic book magicians cast their spells the same way as other magicians. Usually, each hero has a specific technique for creating their magical effects. Some speak their spells backward, saying “tlob gninthgil!” when they want to produce a bolt of electricity. Others use alliterative phrasing, calling upon “hoary hosts” and the like.
Still, others channel their magic through specific objects, such as wands, the aforementioned enchanted helmet, or amulets. By determining this, you start to bring your hero to life and differentiate them from regular costumed supers and other magically-powered characters. That said, first check with your Editor-in-Chief to see if he has any specific ideas on how magic works in his game. He may give you his outlines for spells or, better yet, might take your ideas and adopt them whole cloth.
Once you know how you cast spells, you need to decide what your spells look like. As comics are a visual medium, comic book super mages tend to have showy side effects to their spells. When creating magic, their hands are often surrounded by such effects as great globes of light, bands or rings, elaborate mandalas, or intricate patterns of lines. Magical artifacts glow when used, often with unusual or unnatural colors. 
Combat spells tend to go beyond the “mundane” energy/ element blasts of regular superheroes. They may manifest as a multitude of energy darts, a burning animal shape, or any number of similar effects. Defensive spells often spark or shine when struck or radiate the same effects mentioned when creating spells if an attack hits home.
Another thing to consider is that, unlike regular superheroes, super mages aren’t manipulating real-world energies. They’re working with magical energies, which means they can do things in highly unconventional ways. For example, a regular superhero may perform a Geospatial Shift by traveling at super speed, manipulating time, or converting their mass to energy and back again. On the other hand, a super mage may cut a rift in the “veil between worlds,” shift from our world to a different dimension, and then back, or simply will themselves there. These kinds of effects apply to everything a superheroic magician can do and go hand-in-hand with the idea that superheroic spell casting needs to be showy and visually distinct.
Of course, in a zombie apocalypse, showy spell casting might not be the best of ideas, as it might draw unwanted attention to you and your companions, but that’s the price you pay for mastery of the mystic arts.
</Side Bar>
There are three basic types of mystic heroes:
Practitioners are the magi, the wielders of magic. These heroes derive their powers through mystical rituals requiring an almost inhuman dedication.
The Chosen are those heroes who have been blessed by either mystical beings from beyond the planes of man or those who have been chosen by a powerful magical item that empowers them with their abilities.
Enchanters are those heroes who come at magic differently, sometimes called mystic gadgeteers. These heroes create fantastic instruments which are cable of doing fantastic things.  
Practitioners
Ability Bonus:
Practitioners get where they are through constant study and self-Willpower, which allows them a +2 to their Charisma score.
Unique Advantages: 
Bell, Book, And Candle: To represent your training in the mystic arts, you get a +1 bonus to your Grit and must purchase the Occultist Skill Set (see page XX) during character creation, for which you receive a 5-point discount. In addition, you also gain the Eclectic Knowledge feat for free.

Spell Slinger: As a wielder of the mystic arts, you do not possess powers, but rather cast spells. When choosing a power, it is instead considered a spell and must have the Magical Spell perk (see page xx). Spells that you have memorized or otherwise know are considered inborn powers. All other spells must have the removable flaw, such as they are written in a tome or linked to an object that could be lost mid battle. When casting a spell, you may choose to increase the speed of a power by one action type (i.e. from Bonus Action to Action) increasing the spells power by +2, alternately you can speed up the casting of a spell by one step (i.e. from Action to Bonus Action) decreasing the spells power score by -4.
Unique Disadvantages:
Only Human: Despite your mystic Might, you’re ultimately only human; you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before the application of powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.
Gremlins: All mystic heroes seem to have problems with technology; mystic heroes gain Gremlins as an additional personality flaw, your editor-in-chief may activate this flaw to refuse its affects you must spend a plot point.
Limits of Knowledge: While it may be easier for you to learn new powers through acquiring and mastering new spells, finding new spells has become all but impossible. You may only learn new spells once you have found a complete copy of a spell. The power it may grant you is entirely in the hands of the Editor-in-Chief. Other than new spells, you may only learn new powers if they are powers with the all-skill power modification. 
Enchanters 
Ability Bonus:
Enchanters see the world in ways others cannot even phantom; thus, they gain +2 to their Intelligence score.  
Unique Advantages: 
Techomage: You possess an unparalleled mind for the occult and mystech (mystical technology). You gain skill focus basic engineering and any two of occult’s fields of study. 

So many toys: your powers come from multiple pieces of equipment that share one power source: you. During hero creation, all your powers must result from items; as such, your powers can not have the external power source power modifications and must possess the Removable Item power modification (fully explained under powers pg. XX). Additionally, you may learn the power Inventive Gadgetry, items created through the use of this power do not have the external power source power modification. Instead, they tap into your arcane power; as such, you pay the burnout cost when activating the item's power.  
Unique Disadvantages:
Only Human: Despite your mystic might, you’re ultimately only human; you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before applying powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.

Techno-Shaman: Technology reaches out for you. Unexplained technological phenomenon springs up wherever you go. You might be able to work wonders with a computer, but that computer is just as likely to turn on you. Beware, for there are ghosts in the machine who are hungry for someone like you, someone attuned to their world, your editor-in-chief may activate this flaw to refuse its affects you must spend a plot point.

The Chosen
Ability Bonus:
The Chosen are typically selected because they possess an unorthodox way of seeing things; thus, they gain +2 to their Wisdom score.  
Unique Advantages 
Destiny is All: you’re constantly resisting the urges and demands of your item/Patrion; as such, you gain a +1 bonus to your Grit. Additionally, you gain the Diehard feat for free. 
 Unique Disadvantages:
Only Human: Despite your mystic might, you’re ultimately only human; you may never increase your base Physical Attributes (before the application of powers such as Enhanced Ability Score) beyond 20.
Gremlins: All mystic heroes seem to have problems with technology; mystic heroes gain Gremlins as an additional personality flaw, your editor-in-chief may activate this flaw to refuse its affects you must spend a plot point.

Super-Human 
You may have been born with your powers, seeing them develop over time, or be a result of scientific experimentation. Perhaps you were one of those rare Super- Humans resulting from a “lucky accident,” simply in the right place at the wrong time, triggering what has been referred to as the Ultra-Gene. 
Before Z-Day, all you had to worry about were “super-villains” or ‘Gene purists”. However, with Z-Day has come a disturbing phenomenon: some Super-Humans who possessed the Ultra gene do not simply become zombies, but twisted malign versions of themselves, with all ability to tell right from wrong erased from their psyche. 
Ability Bonus: Super-Humans are heartier than normal humans. You gain +2 to your Constitution score. 
Unique Advantages: 
Super: Because of who and what you are, after hero creation, raise the power scores of all your inborn powers by 1. These powers must be inborn. (Inborn powers are simply powers that are not reliant on an outside source, in other words, part of the hero’s physiology.) or you may gain one power feat of your choice. 
Unique Disadvantages: 
Power Limits: Super-Humans are born with specific Ultra genes, which dictate the powers they can develop. You can only gain new inborn powers through mastering emulated powers.
Later, with the Editor-in-Chief’s permission, you may have your Hero acquire new powers, but they must be made available through technology, supernatural, or some story-based event.

Supernatural
You are possibly the strangest form of costumed hero—a supernatural being.

Before Z-Day, you almost certainly operated from the shadows, fighting criminals and other menaces without drawing too much attention to yourself. If you belonged to a super team, you avoided the spotlight and tended to be somewhat cryptic about your origins and nature. Now, after Z-Day, you are conflicted. You can certainly use your powers to help the scattered enclaves and survivors, but will they accept your help? Or will they look at you as just another zombie?
