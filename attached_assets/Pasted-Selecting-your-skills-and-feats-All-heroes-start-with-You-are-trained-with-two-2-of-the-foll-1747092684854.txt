o	You can buy up to 2 skill sets, highly trained heroes can buy 3.
o	Buying training in a single skills costs 1 point. 
o	You can buy a feat for 5 points.
•	If you gain a skill more than once through any source (say the Drive skill as part of your starting skills and again as part of a skill set), you gain skill focus in that skill or a related field of study, if applicable.
•	If you gain the same feat twice through skill sets, you may choose any other non-power feat in place of one of them.

Choosing Skills to Fit a Particular Theme 
Don't feel limited by a skill set's name. For example, if you want to create a hero who was once a psychologist, you can choose the Public Relations/Con Artist skill set and become trained in Science (Psychology). If you want to create a commercial pilot, you could select either the Academic/Student or Business Professional skill set and take the Pilot skill. Skill sets shouldn't restrict you; if none fit your hero, purchase the skills that suit your vision.

Skill Focus: If a skill has fields of study, you may gain skill focus in one of those fields. If it does not, you may gain focus on the skill itself. You gain Advantage on all checks with the chosen skill or field of study. During character creation, there are two ways to get skill focus: either by getting a feat that grants it or by getting the same skill twice via skill sets; you can’t buy a skill twice to get skill focus.

Starting languages 
You are considered to be literate and fluent in your native language. Through linguistic skill, you can learn additional languages.
