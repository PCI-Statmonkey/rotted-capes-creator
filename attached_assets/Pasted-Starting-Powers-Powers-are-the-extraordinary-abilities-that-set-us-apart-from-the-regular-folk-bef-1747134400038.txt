Starting Powers
Powers are the extraordinary abilities that set us apart from the regular folk, before all we had to worry about was those powers in the wrong hands, and we had our hands full with them. Now we have Super Z’s to worry about. But it’s not them that I worry the most about, they are so territorial you can keep clear of them if ya need too. I worry about those who use their powers raid enclaves for their resources while put regular folk under heal in exchange for their “protection” 
During this step you will precocious your powers. Powers like Ability scores have a Power Score that can range from 10 upwards. Although there are reports of bystanders and epsilon level heroes possessing powers with a power scores of 9 and below, but B-Listers will commonly start with powers ranging from 10 to 20, before power modifications, with some exceptions.

Determining your Starting Power Scores 
There are three ways to determine your power scores.

Option 1: Choose a Power Set 
1.	Choose a power set: Power sets are collections of similar powers that fall within a particular theme; if you choose a power set, you must choose a power set in accordance with your archetype. Once you choose your power set, you may rearrange the powers scores as you wish among the set’s powers. While power sets limit your choices, they do have slightly higher scores than those provided by other options.
2.	Apply any power flaws/perks to your powers which may increase or decrease the final score
a.	You may apply any number of power modifications to a power, but if a power’s final score, after modifications, exceeds your rank cap (20 + 5 × your rank), it is capped at this maximum. Any points above the cap are considered untapped potential. You can utilize the power’s score up to the new rank cap as you increase in rank.
b.	You may not use perks to reduce a power’s final score below 10.
